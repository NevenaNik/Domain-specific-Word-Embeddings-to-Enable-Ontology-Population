History of the automobile

Mobility has always played a crucial role in
the course of human development. In al-
most every era, man has attempted to find
the means to allow him to transport people
over long distances at the highest possible
speed. It took the development of reliable
internal-combustion engines that were op-
erated on liquid fuels to turn the vision of 
a self-propelling “automobile” into reality
(combination of Greek: autos = self and
Latin: mobilis = mobile).

Development history

It would be hard to imagine life in our mod-
ern day without the motor car. Its emergence
required the existence of many conditions
without which an undertaking of this kind
would not have been possible. At this point,
some development landmarks may be worthy
of note. They represent an essential contribu-
tion to the development of the automobile:

In 1885 Carl
Benz enters the
annals of his-
tory as the in-
ventor of the
first automo-
bile. His patent
marks the be-
ginning of the
rapid develop-
ment of the
 automobile

powered by the internal-combustion engine.
Public opinion remained  divided, however.
While the proponents of the new age lauded
the automobile as the epitome of progress,
the majority of the population protested
against the increasing annoyances of dust,
noise, accident hazard, and inconsiderate
motorists. Despite all of this, the progress 
of the automobile proved unstoppable.

In the begin-
ning, the acqui-
sition of an au-
tomobile repre-
sented a serious
challenge. 
A road network

was virtually nonexistent; repair shops were
unknown, fuel was purchased at the drugstore,
and spare parts were produced on demand by
the local blacksmith. The prevailing circum-
stances made the first long-distance journey by
Bertha Benz in 1888 an even more astonishing
accomplishment. She is thought to have been
the first woman behind the wheel of a motor-
ized vehicle. She also demonstrated the relia-
bility of the automobile by journeying the then
enormous distance of more than 100 kilome-
ters (about 60 miles) between Mannheim and
Pforzheim in south-western Germany.

In the early days, however, few entrepreneurs
– with the exception of Benz – considered
the significance of the engine-powered vehi-
cle on a worldwide scale. It was the French
who were to help the automobile to great-
ness. Panhard & Levassor used licenses for
Daimler engines to build their own automo-
biles. Panhard pioneered construction fea-
tures such as the steering wheel, inclined
steering column, clutch pedal, pneumatic
tires, and tube-type radiator.

In the years that followed, the industry
mushroomed with the arrival of companies
such as Peugeot, Citroën, Renault, Fiat, Ford,
Rolls-Royce, Austin, and others. The influ-
ence of Gottlieb Daimler, who was selling
his engines almost all over the world, added
significant impetus to these developments.

Taking their original design from coachbuild-
ing, the motor cars of the time would soon
evolve into the automobiles as we know them
today. However, it should be noted that each
automobile was an individual product of
purely manual labor. A fundamental change
came with the introduction of the assembly
line by Henry Ford in 1913. With the Model T,
he revolutionized the automobile industry in
the United States. It was exactly at this junc-
ture that the automobile ceased to be an arti-
cle of luxury. By producing large numbers 
of automobiles, the price of an automobile
dropped to such a level that it became accessi-
ble to the general public for the first time. 
Although Citroën and Opel were among the

first to bring
the assembly
line to Europe,
it would gain
acceptance only
in the mid-
1920s.

Automobile manufacturers were quick to real-
ize that, in order to be successful in the market -
place, they had to accommodate the wishes of
their customers. Automobile racing victories
were exploited for commercial advertising.
With ever-advancing speed records, profes-
sional race drivers left indelible impressions of
themselves and the brand names of their auto-
mobiles in the minds of spectators. In addition,
efforts were made to broaden the product line.
As a result, the following decades produced a
variety of automobile designs based on the pre-
vailing zeitgeist, as well as the economic and
political influences of the day. E.g., streamlined
vehicles were unable to gain acceptance prior to
WWII due to the demand for large and repre-
sentative automobiles. Manufacturers of the
time designed and built the most exclusive au-
tomobiles, such
as the Merce -
des-Benz 500 K,
Rolls-Royce
Phantom III,
Horch 855, or
Bugatti Royale.

WWII had a sig-
nificant influence
on the develop-
ment of smaller
cars. The Volks -
wagen model
that came to be
known as the
“Beetle” was designed by Ferdinand Porsche
and was manufactured in Wolfsburg. At the
end of the war, the demand for cars that were
small and affordable was prevalent. Respond-
ing to this demand, manufacturers produced
automobiles such as the Goliath GP 700,
Lloyd 300, Citroën 2CV, Trabant, Isetta, and
the Fiat 500 C (Italian name: Topolino = little
mouse). The manufacture of automobiles be-
gan to evolve new standards; there was greater
emphasis on technology and integrated acces-
sories, with a reasonable price/performance
ratio as a major consideration.

Today, the em-
phasis is on a
high level of
occupant
safety; the ever-
rising traffic
volumes and
significantly
higher speeds compared with yesteryear are
making the airbag, ABS, TCS, ESP, and intel-
ligent sensors virtually indispensable. The
ongoing development of the automobile has
been powered by innovative engineering on
the part of the auto industry and by the con-
stant rise in market demands. However, 
there are fields of endeavor that continue 
to present a challenge well into the future.
One example is the further reduction of
 environmental burdens through the use of
alternative energy sources (e.g., fuel cells).
One thing, however, is not expected to
change in the near future – it is the one con-
cept that has been associated with the auto-
mobile for more than a century, and which
had inspired its original creators – it is the
enduring ideal of individual mobility.

More than 15 million
units were produced of
the Model T, affection-
ately called “Tin Lizzie”.

topped only by the

Pioneers of automotive
 technology

Nikolaus August

born in Holzhausen
(Germany), devel-
oped an interest in
technical matters at
an early age. Beside
his employment as 
a traveling salesman
for food wholesalers,

 cooperation. Besides inventing the first mo-
torcycle, Daimler mainly worked on develop-
ing a gasoline engine suitable for use in road
vehicles. In 1889 Daimler and Maybach in-
troduced the first “steel-wheeled vehicle” 
in Paris featuring a two-cylinder V-engine.
Scarcely one year later, Daimler was market-
ing his fast-running Daimler engine on an
international scale. In 1891, for example,
 Armand Peugeot successfully entered a vehi-
cle he had engineered himself in the Paris-
Brest-Paris long-distance trial. It proved both
the worth of his design and the dependability
of the Daimler engine he was using.

Daimler’s merits lie in the systematic devel-
opment of the gasoline engine and in the
 international distribution of his engines.

he was preoccupied with the functioning of
gas-powered engines. 

From 1862 onward he dedicated himself
totally to engine construction. He managed
to make improvements to the gas engine
 invented by the French engineer, Étienne
Lenoir. For this work, Otto was awarded the
gold medal at the 1867 Paris World Fair.
 Together with Daimler and Maybach, he
 developed an internal-combustion engine
based on the four-stroke principle he had
formulated in 1861. The resulting engine is
known as the “Otto engine” to this day. In
1884 Otto invented magneto ignition, which
allowed engines to be powered by gasoline.
This innovation would form the basis for
the main part of Robert Bosch’s life’s work.

Otto’s singular contribution was his ability
to be the first to build the four-stroke inter-
nal-combustion engine and demonstrate its
superiority over all its predecessors.

Gottlieb Daimler
(1834–1900) hailed
from Schorndorf
(Germany). He
 studied mechanical
engineering at the
Polytechnikum engi-
neering college in
Stuttgart. In 1865 
he met the highly
talented engineer Wilhelm Maybach. From
that moment on, the two men would be
joined in a lasting relationship of mutual

Wilhelm Maybach
(1846–1929), a na-
tive of Heilbronn
(Germany), com-
pleted his appren-
ticeship as a techni-
cal draftsman. Soon
after, he worked as 
a design engineer.
Among his employ-

ers was the firm of Gasmotoren Deutz AG
(founded by Otto). He already earned the
nickname of “king of engineers” during his
own lifetime. 

Maybach revised the gasoline engine and
brought it to production. He also developed
water cooling, the carburetor, and the dual-
ignition system. In 1900 Maybach built a
revolutionary, alloy-based racing car. This
vehicle was developed in response to a sug-
gestion by an Austrian businessman named
Jellinek. His order for 36 of these cars was
given on condition that the model was to be
named after his daughter Mercedes.

Maybach’s virtuosity as a design engineer
pointed the way to the future of the contem-
porary automobile industry. His death sig-
naled the end of the grand age of the auto-
motive pioneers.

In 1893 the Duryea Brothers built the first
American automobile. Ford managed to even
the score in 1896 by introducing his own car,
the “Quadricycle Runabout”, which was to
serve as the basis for numerous additional de-
signs. In 1908 Ford introduced the legendary
“Model T”, which was mass-produced on as-
sembly lines from 1913 onward. Beginning in
1921, with a 55-percent share in the country’s
industrial production, Ford dominated the
domestic automobile market in the USA.

The name Henry Ford is synonymous with
the motorization of the United States. It was
his ideas that made the automobile accessi-
ble to a broad segment of the population.

company, a factory for iron-foundry
 products and industrial components in
Mannheim.

Independently of Daimler and Maybach,
he also pursued the means of fitting an en-
gine in a vehicle. When the essential claims
stemming from Otto’s four-stroke engine
patent had been declared null and void,
Benz also developed a surface carburetor,
electrical ignition, the clutch, water cooling,
and a gearshift system, besides his own four-
stroke engine. In 1886 he applied for his
patent and presented his motor carriage to
the public. In the period until the year 1900,
Benz was able to offer more than 600 models
for sale. In the period between 1894 and
1901 the factory of Benz & Co. produced the
“Velo”, which, with a total output of about
1200 units, may be called the first mass-pro-
duced automobile. In 1926 Benz merged
with Daimler to form “Daimler-Benz AG”.

Carl Benz introduced the first automobile
and established the preconditions for the in-
dustrial manufacture of production vehicles.

Henry Ford
(1863–1947) hailed
from Dearborn,
Michigan (USA).
 Although Ford had
found secure em-
ployment as an
 engineer with the
Edison Illuminating
Company in 1891,
his personal interests were dedicated to the
advancement of the gasoline engine.

Karl Diesel
(1858–1913), born
in Paris (France),
decided to become
an engineer at the
age of 14. He gradu-
ated from the Poly-
technikum engi-
neering college in

Munich with the best marks the institution
had given in its entire existence.

In 1892 Diesel was issued the patent for 
the “Diesel engine” that was later to bear his
name. The engine was quickly adopted as a
stationary power plant and marine engine. 
In 1908 the first commercial truck was pow-
ered by a diesel engine. However, its entrance
into the world of passenger cars would take
several decades. The diesel engine became the
power plant for the serial-produced Mercedes
260 D as late as 1936. Today’s diesel engine
has reached a level of development such that
it is now as common as the gasoline engine.

With his invention, Diesel has made a major
contribution to a more economical utiliza-
tion of the internal-combustion engine. Al-
though Diesel became active internationally
by granting production licenses, he failed to
earn due recognition for his achievements
during his lifetime.

Robert Bosch’s life’s work

Robert Bosch’s life’s work
(1861–1942)

“It has always been an
unbearable thought to
me that someone could
inspect one of my pro -
ducts and find it inferior
in any way. For that rea-
son, I have constantly
endeavored to make
products that withstand
the closest scrutiny –
products that prove
themselves superior 
in every respect.”

Robert Bosch

First ad in the Stuttgart
daily “Der Beobachter”
(The Observer), 1887

Robert Bosch, born on September 23, 1861 in
Albeck near Ulm (Germany), was the scion of
a wealthy farmer’s family. After completing his
apprenticeship as a precision fitter, he worked
temporarily for a number of enterprises, where
he continued to hone his technical skills and
expand his merchandising abilities and experi-
ence. After six months as an auditor studying
electrical engineering at Stuttgart technical
university, he traveled to the United States to
work for “Edison Illuminating”. He was later
employed by “Siemens Brothers” in England. 

In 1886 he decided to open a “Workshop 
for Precision Mechanics and Electrical
 Engineering” in the back of a dwelling in
Stuttgart’s west end. He employed another
mechanic and an apprentice. At the begin-
ning, his field of work lay in installing and
repairing telephones, telegraphs, lightning

conductors, and other light-engineering
jobs. His dedication in finding rapid solu-
tions to new problems also helped him gain
a competitive lead in his later activities.

To the automobile industry, the low-voltage
magneto ignition developed by Bosch in 1897
represented – much unlike its unreliable pre-
decessors – a true breakthrough. This product
was the launching board for the rapid expan-
sion of Robert Bosch’s business. He always
managed to bring the purposefulness of the
world of technology and economics into har-
mony with the needs of humanity. Bosch was
a trailblazer in many aspects of social care.

Robert Bosch performed technological pio-
neering work in developing and bringing the
following products to maturity: 
(cid:2) Low-voltage magneto ignition
(cid:2) High-voltage magneto ignition for higher
engine speeds (engineered by his colleague
Gottlob Honold)

(cid:2) Spark plug
(cid:2) Ignition distributor
(cid:2) Battery (passenger vehicles and motor cycles)
(cid:2) Electrical starter
(cid:2) Generator (alternator)
(cid:2) Lighting system with first electric headlamp
(cid:2) Diesel injection pumps
(cid:2) Car radio (manufactured by “Ideal-Werke”,

renamed “Blaupunkt” in 1938)
(cid:2) First lighting system for bicycles
(cid:2) Bosch horn
(cid:2) Battery ignition
(cid:2) Bosch semaphore turn signal (initially

ridiculed as being typical of German sense
of organization – now the indispensable
direction indicator) 

At this point, many other achievements, 
also in the area of social engagement, would
be worthy of note. They are clear indicators
that Bosch was truly ahead of his time. His
forward-thinking mind has given great im-
petus to advances in automobile develop-
ment. The rising number of self-driving mo-
torists fostered a corresponding increase in
the need for repair facilities. In the 1920s
Robert Bosch launched a campaign aimed

at creating a comprehensive service organi-
zation. In 1926, within Germany, these ser-
vice repair centers were uniformly named
“Bosch-Dienst” (Bosch Service) and the
name was registered as a trademark.

Bosch had similarly high ambitions with
 regard to the implementation of social-care
objectives. Having introduced the 8-hour day
in 1906, he compensated his workers with
ample wages. In 1910 he donated one million
reichsmarks to support technical education.
Bosch took the production of the 500,000th
magneto as an occasion to introduce the
work-free Saturday afternoon. Among other
Bosch-induced improvements were old-age
pensions, workplaces for the severely handi-
capped, and the vacation scheme. In 1913 the
Bosch credo, “Occupation and the practice of
apprenticeship are more knowledgeable edu-
cators than mere theory” resulted in the in-
auguration of an apprentice workshop that
provided ample space for 104 apprentices.

In mid-1914 the name of Bosch was already
represented around the world. But the era 
of great expansion between 1908 and 1940
would also bring the strictures of two world
wars. Prior to 1914, 88 % of the products
made in Stuttgart were slated for export.
Bosch was able to continue expansion with
the aid of large contingents destined for the
military. However, in light of the atrocities of
the war years, he disapproved of the resulting
profits. As a result, he donated 13 million
reichs marks for social-care purposes. 

After the end of WWI it was difficult to regain
a foothold in foreign markets. In the United
States, for example, Bosch factories, sales of-
fices, and the corporate logo and symbol had
been confiscated and sold to an American
company. One of the consequences was that
products appeared under the “Bosch” brand
name that were not truly Bosch-made. It
would take until the end of the 1920s before
Bosch had reclaimed all of his former rights
and was able to reestablish himself in the
United States. The Founder’s unyielding de-

termination to overcome any and all obstacles
returned the company to the markets of the
world and, at the same time, imbued the
minds of Bosch employees with the interna-
tional significance of Bosch as an enterprise.

A closer look at two specific events may 
serve to underscore the social engagement 
of Robert Bosch. In 1936 he donated funds 
to construct a hospital that was officially
opened in 1940. In his inaugural speech,
Robert Bosch emphasized his personal dedi-
cation in terms of social engagement: “Every
job is important, even the lowliest. Let no
man delude himself that his work is more
important than that of a colleague.” 

With the passing of Robert Bosch in 1942,
the world mourned an entrepreneur who
was a pioneer not only in the arena of tech-
nology and electrical engineering, but also
in the realm of social engagement. Until this
day, Robert Bosch stands as an example of
progressive zeitgeist, of untiring diligence, 
of social improvements, of entrepreneurial
spirit, and as a dedicated champion of edu-
cation. His vision of progress culminated in
the words, “Knowledge, ability, and will are
important, but success only comes from
their harmonious interaction.”

In 1964 the Robert Bosch Foundation was
 inaugurated. Its activities include the pro-
motion and support of health care, welfare,
education, as well as sponsoring the arts and
culture, humanities and social sciences. 
The Foundation continues to nurture the
founder’s ideals to this day.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Method of operation

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

The gasoline or spark-ignition (SI) internal-
combustion engine uses the Otto cycle 1)
and externally supplied ignition. It burns an
air/fuel mixture and in the process converts
the chemical energy in the fuel into kinetic
energy. 

For many years, the carburetor was respon-
sible for providing an air/fuel mixture in the
intake manifold which was then drawn into
the cylinder by the downgoing piston. 

The breakthrough of gasoline fuel injec-
tion, which permits extremely precise meter-
ing of the fuel, was the result of the legisla-
tion governing exhaust-gas emission limits.
Similar to the carburetor process, with man-
ifold fuel injection the air/fuel mixture is
formed in the intake manifold. 

Even more advantages resulted from the
 development of gasoline direct injection, in
particular with regard to fuel economy and
increases in power output. Direct injection
injects the fuel directly into the engine cylin-
der at exactly the right instant in time. 

1) Named after Nikolaus Otto (1832–1891) who presented
the first gas engine with compression using the 4-stroke
principle at the Paris World Fair in 1878.

Method of operation

The combustion of the air/fuel mixture
causes the piston (Fig. 1, Pos. 8) to perform
a reciprocating movement in the cylinder (9).
The name reciprocating-piston engine, or
better still reciprocating engine, stems from
this principle of functioning. 

The conrod (10) converts the piston’s   
re ciprocating movement into a crankshaft
(11) rotational movement which is main-
tained by a flywheel at the end of the crank-
shaft. Crankshaft speed is also referred to as
engine speed or engine rpm.

Four-stroke principle
Today, the majority of the internal-combus-
tion engines used as vehicle power plants are
of the four-stroke type. The four-stroke prin-
ciple employs gas-exchange valves (5 and 6)
to control the exhaust-and-refill cycle. These
valves open and close the cylinder’s intake
and exhaust passages, and in the process con-
trol the supply of fresh air/fuel mixture and
the forcing out of the burnt exhaust gases.

Method of operation

1st stroke: Induction
Referred to Top Dead Center (TDC), the pis-
ton is moving downwards and increases the
volume of the combustion chamber (7) so
that fresh air (gasoline direct injection) or
fresh air/fuel mixture (manifold injection) 
is drawn into the combustion chamber past
the opened intake valve (5). 

The combustion chamber reaches maxi-

mum volume (Vh+Vc) at Bottom Dead
 Center (BDC).

2nd stroke: Compression
The gas-exchange valves are closed, and the
piston is moving upwards in the cylinder. In
doing so it reduces the combustion-chamber
volume and compresses the air/fuel mixture.
On manifold-injection engines the air/fuel
mixture has already entered the combustion
chamber at the end of the induction stroke.
With a direct-injection engine on the other
hand, depending upon the operating mode,
the fuel is first injected towards the end of the
compression stroke. 

At Top Dead Center (TDC) the combus-

tion-chamber volume is at minimum
 (compression volume Vc).

3rd stroke: Power (or combustion)
Before the piston reaches Top Dead Center
(TDC), the spark plug (2) initiates the com-
bustion of the air/fuel mixture at a given  
ig nition point (ignition angle). This form 
of  ignition is known as externally supplied
 ignition. The piston has already passed its
TDC point before the mixture has combusted
completely. 

The gas-exchange valves remain closed and
the combustion heat increases the pressure in
the cylinder to such an extent that the piston
is forced downward. 

4th stroke: Exhaust
The exhaust valve (6) opens shortly before
Bottom Dead Center (BDC). The hot (ex-
haust) gases are under high pressure and
leave the cylinder through the exhaust valve.
The remaining exhaust gas is forced out by
the upwards-moving piston. 

A new operating cycle starts again with the
induction stroke after every two revolutions
of the crankshaft. 

Valve timing
The gas-exchange valves are opened and
closed by the cams on the intake and exhaust
cam shafts (3 and 1 respectively).  
On engines with only 1 camshaft, a lever
mechanism transfers the cam lift to the  
gas-exchange valves. 

The valve timing defines the opening and
closing times of the gas-exchange valves. Since
it is referred to the crankshaft pos ition, timing
is given in “degrees crankshaft”. Gas flow and
gas-column vibration effects are applied to im-
prove the filling of the combustion chamber
with air/fuel mixture and to remove the ex-
haust gases. This is the reason for the valve
opening and closing times overlapping in a
given crankshaft angular-position range.

The camshaft is driven from the crankshaft
through a toothed belt (or a chain or gear pair).
On 4-stroke engines, a complete working cycle
takes two rotations of the crankshaft. In other
words, the camshaft only turns at half crank-
shaft speed, so that the step-down ratio be-
tween crankshaft and camshaft is 2:1.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Method of operation

Compression
The difference between the maximum piston
displacement Vh and the compression volume
Vc is the compression ratio

ε = (Vh + Vc)/Vc.

The engine’s compression ratio is a vital
 factor in determining 
(cid:2) Torque generation
(cid:2) Power generation
(cid:2) Fuel economy and
(cid:2) Emissions of harmful pollutants

The gasoline-engine’s compression ratio ε
varies according to design configuration and
the selected form of fuel injection (manifold
or direct injection ε = 7...13). Extreme com-
pression ratios of the kind employed in diesel
powerplants (ε = 14...24) are not suitable for
use in gasoline engines. Because the knock re-
sistance of the fuel is limited, the extreme
compression pressures and the high combus-
tion-chamber temperatures resulting from
such compression ratios must be avoided in
order to prevent spontaneous and uncon-
trolled detonation of the air/fuel mixture. The
resulting knock can damage the engine.

Air/fuel ratio
Complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture
relies on a stoichiometric mixture ratio. A

stoichiometric ratio is defined as 14.7 kg of
air for 1 kg of fuel, that is, a 14.7 to 1 mixture
ratio.

The air/fuel ratio λ (lambda) indicates the
extent to which the instantaneous monitored
air/fuel ratio deviates from the theoretical
ideal:

λ = 

induction air mass
theoretical air requirement

The lambda factor for a stoichiometric ratio
is λ 1.0. λ is also referred to as the excess-air
factor.

Richer fuel mixtures result in λ figures of

less than 1. Leaning out the fuel produces
mixtures with excess air: λ then exceeds 1. Be-
yond a certain point the mixture encounters
the lean-burn limit, beyond which ignition is
no longer possible. The excess-air factor has a
decisive effect on the specific fuel consump-
tion (Fig. 3) and untreated pollutant emis-
sions (Fig. 4).

Induction-mixture distribution in the
combustion chamber 
Homogeneous distribution
The induction systems on engines with mani -
fold injection distribute a homogeneous
air/fuel mixture throughout the  combustion
chamber. The entire induction charge has a
single excess-air factor λ (Fig. 5a). Lean-burn
engines, which operate on excess air under

specific operating conditions, also rely on ho-
mogeneous mixture distribution.

Stratified-charge concept
A combustible mixture cloud with λ ≈ 1 sur-
rounds the tip of the spark plug at the instant
ignition is triggered. At this point the remain-
der of the combustion chamber contains
 either non-combustible gas with no fuel, 
or an extremely lean air/fuel charge. The cor-
responding strategy, in which the ignitable
mixture cloud is present only in one portion of
the combustion chamber, is the stratified-
charge concept (Fig. 5b). With this concept,
the overall mixture – meaning the average
mixture ratio within the entire combustion
chamber – is extremely lean (up to λ ≈ 10). This
type of lean operation fosters extremely high
levels of fuel economy.

chamber

b

Efficient implementation of the stratified-
charge concept is impossible without direct
fuel injection, as the entire induction strategy
depends on the ability to inject fuel directly
into the combustion chamber just  before ig-
nition.

Ignition and flame propagation
The spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture by
discharging a spark across a gap. The extent
to which ignition will result in reliable flame
propagation and secure combustion depends
in large part on the air/fuel mixture λ, which
should be in a range extending from λ =
0.75...1.3. Suitable flow patterns in the area
immediately adjacent to the spark-plug elec-
trodes can be employed to ignite mixtures as
lean as λ ≤ 1.7. 

The initial ignition event is followed by for-
mation of a flame-front. The flame front’s
propagation rate rises as a function of com-
bustion pressure before dropping off again
toward the end of the combustion process.
The mean flame front propagation rate is 
on the order of 15...25 m/s. 

The flame front’s propagation rate is the
combination of mixture transport and com-
bustion rates, and one of its defining factors is
the air/fuel ratio λ. The combustion rate peaks
at slightly rich mixtures on the order 
of λ = 0.8...0.9. In this range it is possible to ap-
proach the conditions coinciding with an ideal
constant-volume combustion process (refer to
section on “Engine efficiency”). Rapid com-
bustion rates provide highly satisfactory full-
throttle, full-load performance at high engine
speeds. 

Good thermodynamic efficiency is

 produced by the high combustion tempera-
tures achieved with air/fuel mixtures of 
λ = 1.05...1.1. However, high combustion
temperatures and lean mixtures also promote
generation of nitrous oxides (NOX), which
are subject to strict limitations under official
emissions standards.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Cylinder charge

Cylinder charge

An air/fuel mixture is required for the com-
bustion process in the cylinder. The engine
draws in air through the intake manifolds
(Fig. 1, Pos. 14), the throttle valve (13) ensur-
ing that the air quantity is metered. The fuel
is metered through fuel injectors. Further-
more, usually part of the burnt mixture
 (exhaust gas) from the last combustion is
 retained as residual gas (9) in the cylinder or
exhaust gas is returned specifically to increase
the residual-gas content in the cylinder (4).

Components of the cylinder charge
The gas mixture trapped in the combustion
chamber when the intake valve closes is re-
ferred to as the cylinder charge. This is com-
prised of the fresh gas and the residual gas. 

The term “relative air charge rac” has been

introduced in order to have a quantity
which is independent of the engine’s dis-
placement. It describes the air content in 
the cylinder and is defined as the ratio of 
the current air quantity in the cylinder to
the air quantity that would be contained in
the engine displacement under standard
conditions (p0 = 1013 hPa, T0 =273 K). Ac-
cordingly, there is a relative fuel quantity rfq;
this is defined in such a way that identical
values for rac and rfq result in λ = 1, i.e., 
λ = rac/rfq, or with specified λ : rfq = rac/λ.

Fresh gas
The freshly introduced gas mixture in the
cylinder is comprised of the fresh air drawn
in and the fuel entrained with it. In a mani-
fold-injection engine, all the fuel has already
been mixed with the fresh air upstream of
the intake valve. On direct-injection systems,
on the other hand, the fuel is injected di-
rectly into the combustion chamber.

The majority of the fresh air enters the

cylinder with the air-mass flow (Fig. 1, 
Pos. 6, 7) via the throttle valve (13). Addi-
tional fresh gas, comprising fresh air and
fuel vapor, is directed to the cylinder via the
evaporative-emissions control system (3, 2).

For homogeneous operation at λ (cid:2) 1, the
air in the cylinder directed via the throttle
valve after the intake valve (11) has closed 
is the decisive quantity for the work at the
piston during the combustion stroke and
therefore for the engine’s output torque. In
this case, the air charge corresponds to the
torque and the engine load. Here, changing
the throttle-valve angle only indirectly leads
to a change in the air charge. First of all, the
pressure in the intake manifold must rise so
that a greater air mass flows into the cylinder
via the intake valves. Fuel can, on the other
hand, be injected more contemporaneously
with the combustion process and metered
precisely to the individual cylinder. There-
fore the injected fuel quantity is dependent
on the current air quantity, and the gasoline
engine is an air-directed system in “conven-
tional” homogeneous mode at λ (cid:2) 1.

During lean-burn operation (stratified
charge), however, the torque (engine load) –
on account of the excess air – is a direct
product of the injected fuel mass. The air
mass can thus differ for the same torque.
The gasoline engine is therefore fuel-di-
rected during lean-burn operation.

Almost always, measures aimed at increasing
the engine’s maximum torque and maxi-
mum output power necessitate an increase
in the maximum possible fresh-gas charge.
This can be achieved by increasing the en-
gine displacement but also by supercharging
(see section entitled “Supercharging”). 

Residual gas
The residual-gas share of the cylinder charge
comprises that portion of the cylinder charge
which has already taken part in the combus-
tion process. In principle, one differentiates
between internal and external residual gas.
Internal residual gas is the exhaust gas which
remains in the upper clearance volume of the
cylinder after combustion or which, while
the intake and exhaust valves are simultane-
ously open (valve overlap, see section entitled
“Gas exchange”), is drawn from the exhaust
port back into the intake manifold (internal
exhaust-gas recirculation). 

External residual gas is exhaust gas which

is introduced via an exhaust-gas recircula-
tion valve (Fig. 1, Pos. 4, 5) into the intake
manifold (external exhaust-gas recircula-
tion).

The residual gas is made up of inert gas 1)
and – in the event of excess air, i.e., during
lean-burn operation – of unburnt air. The
amount of inert gas in the residual gas is
particularly important. This no longer con-
tains any oxygen and therefore does not par-
ticipate in combustion during the following
power cycle. However, it does delay ignition
and slows down the course of combustion,
which results in slightly lower efficiency but
also in lower peak pressures and tempera-
tures. In this way, a specifically used amount
of residual gas can reduce the emission of
nitrogen oxides (NOX). This then is the
 benefit of inert gas in lean-burn operation
in that the three-way catalytic converter is
unable to reduce the nitrogen oxides in the
event of excess air.

1) Components in the combustion chamber which behave

inertly, that is, do not participate in the combustion process.

In homogeneous engine mode, the fresh-gas
charge displaced by the residual gas (consist-
ing in this case of inert gas only) is compen-
sated by means of a greater opening of the
throttle valve. With a constant fresh-gas
charge, this increases the intake-manifold
pressure, therefore reduces the throttling
losses (see section entitled “Gas exchange”),
and in all results in reduced fuel consump-
tion. 

Gas exchange
The process of replacing the consumed
cylinder charge (exhaust gas, also referred to
in the above as residual gas) with fresh gas is
known as gas exchange or the charge cycle. 
It is controlled by the opening and closing of
the intake and exhaust valves in combina-
tion with the piston stroke. The shape and
position of the camshaft cams determine the
progression of the valve lift and thereby in-
fluence the cylinder charge. 

The opening and closing times of the
valves are called valve timing and the maxi-
mum distance a valve is lifted from its seat is
known as the valve lift or valve stroke. The
characteristic variables are Exhaust Opens
(EO), Exhaust Closes (EC), Intake Opens
(IO), Intake Closes (IC) and the valve lift.
There are engines with fixed and others with
variable timing and valve lifts (see chapter
entitled “Cylinder-charge control systems”).

The amount of residual gas for the following
power cycle can be significantly influenced
by a valve overlap. During the valve overlap,
intake and exhaust valves are simultaneously
open for a certain amount of time, i.e., the
intake valve opens before the exhaust valve
closes. If in the overlap phase the pressure 
in the intake manifold is lower than that 
in the exhaust train, the residual gas flows
back into the intake manifold; because the
residual gas drawn back in this way is drawn
in again after Exhaust Closes, this results in
an increase in the residual-gas content. 

14

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Cylinder charge

In the case of supercharging, the pressure be-
fore the intake valve can also be higher during
the overlap phase; in this event, the residual
gas flows in the direction of the exhaust train
such that it is properly cleared away (“scav-
enging”) and it is also possible for the air to
flow through into the exhaust train. 

When the residual gas is successfully scav-
enged, its volume is then available for an in-
creased fresh-gas charge. The scavenging effect
is therefore used to increase torque in the
lower speed range (up to approx. 2000 rpm),
either in combination with dynamic super-
charging in naturally aspirated engines or
with turbocharging.

Volumetric efficiency and air consumption
The success of the gas-exchange process is
measured in the variables volumetric effi-
ciency, air consumption and retention rate.
The volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the
fresh-gas charge actually remaining in the
cylinder to the theoretically maximum possi-
ble charge. It differs from the relative air
charge in that the volumetric efficiency is
 referred to the external conditions at the time
of measurement and not to standard condi-
tions. 

The air consumption describes the total
air-mass throughput during the gas-exchange
process, likewise referred to the theoretically
maximum possible charge. The air consump-
tion can also include the air mass which is
transferred directly into the exhaust train
during the valve overlap. The retention rate,
the ratio of volumetric efficiency to air con-
sumption, specifies the proportion of the air-
mass throughput which remains in the cylin-
der at the end of the gas-exchange process.
The maximum volumetric efficiency for
naturally aspirated engines is 0.6...0.9. It de-
pends on the combustion-chamber shape, the
opened cross-sections of the gas-exchange
valves, and the valve timing. 

Pumping losses
Work is expended in the form of pumping
losses or gas-exchange losses in order to re-
place the exhaust gas with fresh gas in the
gas-exchange process. These losses use up
part of the mechanical work generated and
therefore reduce the effective efficiency of the
engine. In the intake phase, i.e., during the
downward stroke of the piston, the intake-
manifold pressure in throttled mode 
is less than the ambient pressure and in
 particular the pressure in the piston return
chamber. The piston must work against this
pressure differential (throttling losses). 

A dynamic pressure occurs in the combus-

tion chamber during the upward stroke of 
the piston when the burnt gas is emitted, 
particularly at high engine speeds and loads;
the piston must expend energy in order to
overcome this pressure (push-out losses).

If with gasoline direct injection stratified-
charge operation is used with the throttle
valve fully opened or high exhaust-gas recir-
culation is used in homogeneous operation
(λ (cid:2) 1), this increases the intake-manifold
pressure and reduces the pressure differential
above the piston. In this way, the engine’s
throttling losses can be reduced, which in
turn improves the effective efficiency.

Supercharging
The torque which can be achieved during 
homogenous operation at λ (cid:2) 1 is propor-
tional to the fresh-gas charge. This means that
maximum torque can be increased by com-
pressing the air before it enters the cylinder
(supercharging). This leads to an increase in
volumetric efficiency to values above 1.

Dynamic supercharging
Supercharging can be achieved simply by 
taking advantage of the dynamic effects inside
the intake manifold. The supercharging level
depends on the intake manifold’s design and
on its operating point (for the most part, on
engine speed, but also on cylinder charge).
The possibility of changing the intake-mani-
fold geometry while the engine is running
(variable intake-manifold geometry) means

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Cylinder charge

15

that dynamic supercharging can be applied
across a wide operating range to increase the
maximum cylinder charge.

Mechanical supercharging
The intake-air density can be further in-
creased by compressors which are driven
mechanically from the engine’s crankshaft.
The compressed air is forced through the
 intake manifold and into the engine’s
 cylinders.

Exhaust-gas turbocharging
In contrast mechanical supercharging, the
compressor of the exhaust-gas turbocharger
is driven by an exhaust-gas turbine located
in the exhaust-gas flow, and not by the en-
gine’s crankshaft. This enables recovery of
some of the energy in the exhaust gas. 

Charge recording
In a gasoline engine with homogeneous 
λ = 1 operation, the injected fuel quantity 
is dependent on the air quantity. This is nec-
essary because after a change to the throttle-
valve angle the air charge changes only grad-
ually while the fuel quantity can be varied
from injection to injection.

For this reason, the current available air
charge must be determined for each com-
bustion in the engine-management system
(charge recording). There are essentially
three systems which can be used to record
the charge:
(cid:2) A hot-film air-mass meter (HFM) mea-
sures the air-mass flow into the intake
manifold.

(cid:2) A model is used to calculate the air-mass
flow from the temperature before the
throttle valve, the pressure before and
 after the throttle valve, and the throttle-
valve angle (throttle-valve model, 
α/n system 1)).

(cid:2) A model is used to calculate the charge

drawn in by the cylinder from the engine
speed (n), the pressure (p) in the intake
manifold (i.e., before the intake valve), 
the temperature in the intake passage and
further additional information (e.g., cam -
shaft/valve-lift adjustment, intake-mani-
fold changeover, position of the swirl con-
trol valve) (p/n system). Sophisticated
models may be necessary, depending on
the complexity of the engine, particularly
with regard to the variabilities of the valve
gear.

Because only the mass flow passing into the
intake manifold can be determined with a
hot-film air-mass meter or a throttle-valve
model, both these systems only provide a
cylinder-charge value during stationary en-
gine operation. Stationary means at constant
intake-manifold pressure; because then the
mass flows flowing into the intake manifold
and off into the engine are identical.

In the event of a sudden load change
(change in the throttle-valve angle), the in-
flowing mass flow changes spontaneously,
while the off-flowing mass flow and with 
it the cylinder charge only change if the
 intake-manifold pressure has increased 
or  reduced. The accumulator behavior 
of the intake manifold must therefore 
also be imitated (intake-manifold model).

1) The designation α/n system is historically conditioned
since originally the pressure after the throttle valve was
not taken into account and the mass flow was stored in 
a program map covering throttle-valve angle and engine
speed. This simplified approach is sometimes still used
 today.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Torque and power

Torque and power

Torques at the drivetrain
The power P delivered by a gasoline engine
is defined by the available clutch torque M
and the engine speed n. The clutch torque 
is the torque developed by the combustion
process less friction torque (friction losses in
the engine), pumping losses, and the torque
needed to drive the auxiliary equipment
(Fig. 1). The drive torque is derived from 
the clutch torque plus the losses arising at
the clutch and transmission.

The combustion torque is generated in
the power cycle and is determined in en-
gines with manifold injection by the follow-
ing variables:
(cid:2) The air mass which is available for com-
bustion when the intake valves close
(cid:2) The fuel mass which is available at the

same moment, and

(cid:2) The moment in time when the ignition
spark initiates the combustion of the
air/fuel mixture

Direct-injection gasoline engines function 
at certain operating points with excess air
(lean-burn operation). The cylinder thus
contains air, which has no effect on the gen-
erated torque. Here, it is the fuel mass which
has the most effect.

Generation of torque 
The physical quantity torque M is the pro -
duct of force F times lever arm s :

M = F · s

The connecting rod utilizes the throw of 
the crankshaft to convert the piston’s linear
travel into rotary motion. The force with
which the expanding air/fuel mixture drives
the piston down the cylinder is converted
into torque by the lever arm generated by
the throw.

The lever arm l which is effective for the
torque is the lever component vertical to the
force (Fig. 2). The force and the leverage an-
gle are parallel at Top Dead Center (TDC).

Torque and power

17

Relationship between torque and power
The engine’s power output P climbs along
with increasing torque M and engine
speed n. The following applies:

P = 2 · π · M · n

Engine power increases until it reaches its
peak value at rated speed nrat with rated
power Prat. Owing to the substantial decrease
in torque, power generation drops again at
extremely high engine speeds.

A transmission to vary conversion ratios

is needed to adapt the gasoline engine’s
torque and power curves to meet the
 requirements of vehicle operation.

This results in an effective lever arm of zero.
The ignition angle must be selected in such a
way as to trigger mixture ignition while the
crankshaft is rotating through a phase of in-
creasing lever arm (0...90 °crankshaft). This
enables the engine to generate the maximum
possible torque. The engine’s design (for in-
stance, piston displacement, combustion-
chamber geometry, volumetric efficiency,
charge) determines the maximum possible
torque M that it can generate. 

Essentially, the torque is adapted to the
 requirements of actual driving by adjusting
the quality and quantity of the air/fuel mix-
ture and the ignition angle. Fig. 3 shows the
typical torque and power curves, plotted
against engine speed, for a manifold-injec-
tion gasoline engine. As engine speed in-
creases, full-load torque initially increases to
its maximum Mmax. At higher engine speeds,
torque falls off again as the shorter opening
times of the intake valves limits the cylinder
charge.

Engine designers focus on attempting 
to obtain maximum torque at low engine
speeds of around 2000 rpm. This rpm range
coincides with optimal fuel economy.
 Engines with exhaust-gas turbochargers 
are able to meet these requirements.

Engine efficiency

Engine efficiency

Thermal efficiency
The internal-combustion engine does not con-
vert all the energy which is chemically available
in the fuel into mechanical work, and some of
the added energy is lost. This means that an en-
gine’s efficiency is less than 100% (Fig. 1).
Thermal efficiency is one of the important links
in the engine’s efficiency chain. 

Pressure-volume diagram (p-V diagram)
The p-V diagram is used to display the
 pressure and volume conditions during 
a complete working cycle of the 4-stroke
IC engine.

The ideal cycle
Figure 2 (curve A) shows the compression
and power strokes of an ideal process as
 defined by the laws of Boyle/Mariotte and
Gay- Lussac. The piston travels from BDC 
to TDC (point 1 to point 2), and the air/fuel
mixture is compressed without the addition
of heat (Boyle/Mariotte). Subsequently, 
the mixture burns accompanied by a pressure
rise (point 2 to point 3) while volume re-
mains constant (Gay-Lussac). 

From TDC (point 3), the piston travels to-

wards BDC (point 4), and the combustion-
chamber volume increases. The pressure of
the burnt gases drops whereby no heat is 
released (Boyle/Mariotte). Finally, the burnt
mixture cools off again with the  volume 
remaining constant (Gay-Lussac)  until the
initial status (point 1) is reached again. 

The area inside the points 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 shows
the work gained during a complete working
cycle. The exhaust valve opens at point 4 and
the gas, which is still under pressure, escapes
from the cylinder. If it were possible for the
gas to expand completely  by the time point 5
is reached, the area described by 1 – 4 – 5
would represent usable energy. On an ex-
haust-gas-turbocharged  engine, the part
above the atmospheric line (1 bar) can
to some extent be utilized (1 – 4 – 5(cid:3)).

Real p-V diagram
Since it is impossible during normal engine
operation to maintain the basic conditions
for the ideal cycle, the actual p-V diagram
(Fig. 2, curve B) differs from the ideal 
p-V diagram.

Measures for increasing thermal efficiency
The thermal efficiency rises along with
 increasing air/fuel-mixture compression. 
The higher the compression, the higher the
pressure in the cylinder at the end of the
compression phase, and the larger is the en-
closed area in the p-V diagram. This area is 
an indication of the energy generated during
the combustion process. When selecting 
the compression ratio, the fuel’s antiknock
 qualities must be taken into account. 

Manifold-injection engines inject the fuel
into the intake manifold onto the closed in-
take valve, where it is stored until drawn 
into the cylinder. During the formation of 
the air/fuel mixture, the fine fuel droplets 
vaporize. The energy needed for this process 
is in the form of heat and is taken from the
air and the intake-manifold walls. On direct-
injection engines the fuel is injected into 
the combustion chamber, and the energy
needed for fuel-droplet vaporization is taken
from the air trapped in the cylinder which
cools off as a result. This means that the 
compressed air/fuel mixture is at a lower tem-
perature than is the case with a manifold-in-
jection engine, so that a higher  compression
ratio can be chosen. 

Thermal losses
The heat generated during combustion heats
up the cylinder walls. Part of this thermal 
energy is radiated and lost. In the case of
gasoline direct injection, the stratified-charge
air/fuel mixture cloud is surrounded by a
jacket of gases which do not participate in the
combustion process. This gas jacket hinders
the transfer of heat to the cylinder walls and
therefore reduces the thermal losses. 

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Engine efficiency

19

Further losses stem from the incomplete
combustion of the fuel which has condensed
onto the cylinder walls. Thanks to the 
insulating effects of the gas jacket, these losses
are reduced in stratified-charge operation.
Further thermal losses result from the resid-
ual heat of the exhaust gases. 

Frictional losses
The frictional losses are the total of all the
friction between moving parts in the engine
itself and in its auxiliary equipment. For in-
stance, due to the piston-ring friction at the
cylinder walls, the bearing friction, and the
friction of the alternator drive.

Losses at λ = 1
The efficiency of the constant-volume cycle
climbs along with increasing excess-air factor
(λ). Due to the reduced flame-propagation
velocity common to lean air/fuel mixtures, at
λ > 1.1 combustion is increasingly sluggish, a
fact which has a negative effect upon the SI
engine’s efficiency curve. In the final analysis,
efficiency is the highest in the range λ =
1.1...1.3. Efficiency is therefore less for a ho-
mogeneous air/fuel-mixture formation with λ
= 1 than it is for an air/fuel mixture featuring
excess air. When a 3-way catalytic converter is
used for emissions control, an air/fuel mix-
ture with λ = 1 is ab -
solutely imperative for efficient operation.

Pumping losses
During the exhaust and refill cycle, the engine
draws in fresh gas during the 1st (induction)
stroke. The desired quantity of gas is con-
trolled by the throttle-valve opening. 
A vacuum is generated in the intake manifold
which opposes engine operation 
(throttling losses). Since with a gasoline 
direct-injection engine the throttle valve is
wide open at idle and part load, and the
torque is determined by the injected fuel
mass, the pumping losses (throttling losses)
are lower.

In the 4th stroke, work is also involved in
forcing the remaining exhaust gases out of
the cylinder.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Specific fuel consumption

Specific fuel consumption

Specific fuel consumption be is defined as the
mass of the fuel (in grams) that the internal-
combustion engine requires to perform a
specified amount of work (kW · h, kilowatt
hours). This parameter thus provides a more
accurate measure of the energy extracted
from each unit of fuel than the terms liters
per hour, litres per 100 kilo meters or miles
per gallon.

Effects of excess-air factor
Homogeneous mixture distribution
When engines operate on homogeneous in-
duction mixtures, specific fuel consumption
initially responds to increases in excess-air
factor λ by falling (Fig. 1). The progressive 
reductions in the range extending to 
λ = 1.0 are explained by the incomplete 
combustion that results when a rich air/
fuel mixture burns with inadequate air. 

The throttle plate must be opened to wider
apertures to obtain a given torque during op-
eration in the lean range (λ > 1). The resulting
reduction in throttling losses combines 
with enhanced thermodynamic efficiency 
to furnish lower rates of specific fuel con-
sumption.

Excess-air factor λ

As the excess-air factor is increased, the flame
front’s propagation rate falls in the  resulting,
progressively leaner mixtures. 
The ignition timing must be further ad-
vanced to compensate for the resulting lag 
in ignition of the combustion mixture. 

As the excess-air factor continues to rise,
the engine approaches the lean-burn limit,
where incomplete combustion takes place
(combustion miss). This results in a radical
increase in fuel consumption. The excess-air
factor that coincides with the lean-burn limit
varies according to engine design.

Stratified-charge concept
Engines featuring direct gasoline injection
can operate with high excess-air factors in
their stratified-charge mode. The only fuel 
in the combustion chamber is found in the
stratification layer immediately adjacent to
the tip of the spark plug. The excess-air  
factor within this layer is approximately 
λ = 1. 

The remainder of the combustion chamber

is filled with air and inert gases (exhaust-
gas recirculation). The large throttle-plate
apertures available in this mode lead to a 
reduction in pumping losses. This combines
with the thermodynamic benefits to provide 
a substantial reduction in specific fuel con-
sumption.

Effects of ignition timing
Homogeneous mixture distribution
Each point in the cycle corresponds to an 
optimal phase in the combustion process
with its own defined ignition timing (Fig. 1).
Any deviation from this ignition timing 
will have negative effects on specific fuel 
consumption. 

Stratified-charge concept
The range of possibilities for varying the igni-
tion angle is limited on direct-injection gaso-
line engines operating in the stratified-charge
mode. Because the ignition spark must be 
triggered as soon as the mixture cloud reaches
the spark plug, the ideal ignition point is largely
determined by injection timing.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Specific fuel consumption

21

Achieving ideal fuel consumption
During operation on homogeneous induc-
tion mixtures, gasoline engines must operate
on a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of λ = 1 to
create an optimal operating environment for
the 3-way catalytic converter. Under these
conditions using the excess-air factor to ma-
nipulate specific fuel consumption is not an
option. Instead, the only available recourse 
is to vary the ignition timing. Defining igni-
tion timing always equates with finding the
best compromise between maximum fuel
economy and minimal levels of raw exhaust
emissions. Because the catalytic converter’s
treatment of toxic emissions is very effective
once it is hot, the aspects related to fuel
economy are the primary considerations
once the engine has warmed to normal
 operating temperature.

Fuel-consumption map
Testing on an engine dynamometer can be
used to determine specific fuel consumption
in its relation to brake mean effective pres-
sure and to engine speed. The monitored
data are then entered in the fuel consump-
tion map (Fig. 2). The points representing
levels of specific fuel consumption are

joined to form curves. Because the resulting
graphic portrayal resembles a sea shell, the
lines are also known as shell or conchoid
curves.

As the diagram indicates, the point of
minimum specific fuel consumption co -
incides with a high level of brake mean
 effective pressure pme at an engine speed 
of roughly 2600 rpm.

Because the brake mean effective pressure
also serves as an index of torque generation
M, curves representing power output P can
also be entered in the chart. Each curve as-
sumes the form of a hyperbola. Although
the chart indicates identical power at differ-
ent engine speeds and torques (operating
points A and B), the specific fuel consump-
tion rates at these operating points are not
the same. At Point B the engine speed is
lower and the torque is higher than at 
Point A. Engine operation can be shifted
 toward Point A by using the transmission 
to select a gear with a higher conversion
 ratio.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Combustion knock

Combustion knock

Among the factors imposing limits on the lati -
tude for enhancing an engine’s thermodynamic
efficiency and increasing power-plant perfor-
mance are spontaneous pre-ignition and detona-
tion. This highly undesirable phenomenon 
is frequently accompanied by an audible “ping-
ing” noise, which is why the generally applicable
term for this condition is “knock”. Knock occurs
when portions of the mixture ignite sponta-
neously before being reached by the flame front.
The intense heat and immense pressure peaks
produced by combustion knock subject pistons,
bearings, cylinder head and head gasket to 
enormous mechanical and thermal loads. Ex-
tended periods of knock can produce blown
head gaskets, holed piston crowns and engine
seizure, and leads to destruction of the engine.

The sources of combustion knock
The spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture to-
ward the end of the compression stroke, just
before the piston reaches Top Dead Centre
(TDC). Because several milliseconds can
elapse until the entire air/fuel mixture can ig-
nite (the precise ignition lag varies  according
to engine speed), the actual combustion peak
occurs after TDC. 

The flame front extends outward from the

spark plug. After being compressed during
the compression stroke, the induction mix-
ture is heated and pressurized as it burns
within the combustion chamber. This further
compresses any unburned air/fuel mixture
within the chamber. As a result, some por-
tions of the compressed air/fuel mixture can
attain temperatures high enough to induce
spontaneous auto-ignition (Fig. 1). Sudden
detonation and uncontrolled combustion are
the results. 

When this type of detonation occurs it pro-
duces a flame front with a propagation rate 10
to 100 times that associated with the normal
combustion triggered by the spark plug (ap-
proximately 20 m/s). This uncontrolled com-
bustion generates pressure pulses which spread
out in circular patterns from the core of the
process. It is when these pulsations impact
against the walls of the cylinder that they 

generate the metallic pinging sound typically 
associated with combustion knock.

Other flame fronts can be initiated at hot
spots within the combustion chamber. Among
the potential sources of this hot-spot ignition
are spark plugs which during operation heat up
excessively due to their heat range being too
low. This type of pre-ignition produces engine
knock by initiating combustion before the 
ignition spark is triggered.

Engine knock can occur throughout the
engine’s speed range. However, it is not possi-
ble to hear it at extremely high rpm, when its
sound is obscured by the noise from general
engine operation.

Factors affecting tendency to knock
Substantial ignition advance: Advancing the
timing to ignite the mixture earlier produces
progressively higher combustion-chamber
temperatures and correspondingly extreme
pressure rises.
High cylinder-charge density: The charge den-
sity must increase as torque demand rises
(engine load factor). This leads to high tem-
peratures during compression.
Fuel grade: Because fuels with low octane 
ratings furnish only limited resistance to
knock, compliance with manufacturer’s 
specifications for fuel grade(s) is vital.
Excessively high compression ratio: One poten-
tial source of excessively high compression
would be a cylinder head gasket of less than
the specified thickness. This leads to higher
pressures and temperatures in the air/fuel
mixture during compression. Deposits and
residue in the combustion chamber (from 
ageing, etc.) can also produce a slight increase
in the effective compression ratio.
Cooling: Ineffective heat dissipation within
the engine can lead to high mixture tempera-
tures within the combustion chamber.
Geometry: The engine’s knock tendency can
be aggravated by unfavorable combustion-
chamber geometry. Poor turbulence and 
swirl characteristics caused by  unsatisfactory
intake-manifold tract configurations are yet
another potential problem source.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Combustion knock

23

Engine knock with direct 
gasoline  injection
With regard to engine knock, when operating
with homogeneous air/fuel mixtures direct-in-
jection gasoline engines behave the same as
manifold-injected power plants. One major
difference is the cooling effect exerted by the
evaporating fuel during direct injection, which
reduces the temperature of the air within the
cylinder to levels lower than those encountered
with manifold injection.

During operation in the stratified-charge
mode it is only in the area immediately adja-
cent to the spark plug tip that an ignitable
mixture is present. When the remainder of the
combustion chamber is filled with air or inert
gases, there is no danger of spontaneous igni-
tion and engine knock. Nor is there any danger
of detonation when an extremely lean air/fuel
mixture is present within these outlying sec-
tions of the combustion chamber. The ignition
energy required to generate a flame in this
kind of lean mixture would be substantially
higher than that needed to spark a stoichio-
metric combustion mixture. This is why strati-
fied-charge operation effectively banishes the
danger of engine knock.

1

The sources of combustion knock

Avoiding consistent engine knock
To effectively avoid pre-ignition and detona-
tion, ignition systems not equipped with
knock detection rely on ignition timing with
a safety margin of 5...8 degrees (crankshaft)
relative to the knock limit.

Ignition systems featuring knock detection
employ one or several knock sensors to moni-
tor acoustic waves in the engine. The engine-
management ECU detects knock in individual
combustion cycles by analysing the electrical
signals relayed by these sensors. The ECU then
responds by retarding the ignition timing for
the affected cylinder to prevent continuous
knock. The system then gradually advances the
ignition timing back toward its original posi-
tion. This progressive advance process contin-
ues until the ignition timing is either back at
the initial reference point programmed into
the engine’s software map, or until the system
starts to detect knock again. The engine man-
agement regulates the timing advance for each
cylinder individually.

The limited number of combustion events

with mild knock of the kind that also occur
with knock control are not injurious to the
health of the engine. On the contrary: They
help dissolve deposits formed by oil and fuel
additives within the combustion chamber (on
intake and exhaust valves, etc.), allowing
them to be combusted and/or discharged
with the exhaust gases.

Advantages of knock control
Thanks to reliable knock recognition,  
engines with knock control can use higher
compression ratios. Co-ordinated control of
the ignition’s timing advance also makes it 
possible to do without the safety margin
 between the timing point and the knock
threshold; the ignition timing can be selected
for the “best case” instead of the “worst case”
scenario. This provides benefits in terms of
thermodynamic efficiency. Knock control 
(cid:2) reduces fuel consumption, 
(cid:2) enhances torque and power, and 
(cid:2) allows engine operation on different fuels
within an extended range of octane ratings
(both premium and regular unleaded, etc.).

Fuels

Fuels for spark-ignition engines (gasolines)

Fuels

The most important energy source from
which fuels are extracted is petroleum or
crude oil. Crude oil was formed over mil-
lions of years from the remains of decom-
posed living organisms and is made up of
many different hydrocarbons. High-quality
fuels make an important contribution to
trouble-free vehicle operation and to low
exhaust-gas emissions. The composition
and properties of fuels are therefore gov-
erned by legal provisions. 

Fuels for spark-ignition
 engines (gasolines)

Components of gasolines 
Gasolines are composed primarily of paraf-
fins and aromatics. Their basic properties
can be improved by the use of organic com-
ponents containing oxygen and additives. 

Paraffins with a pure chain structure
 (standard paraffins, Fig. 1) demonstrate very
good ignition performance but also very low
knock resistance. A chain molecule structure
with additional side chains (iso paraffins) 
or a benzene ring as the skeletal structure
(aromatics) give rise to fuel components
with high knock resistance. 

The following different fuels are sold in
 Germany: Normal, Super and Super Plus.
“Regular” and “Premium” are sold in the
United States; these fuels are roughly com-
parable with Normal and Super respectively
in Germany. Super or Premium gasolines,
thanks to their higher aromatic content and
the addition of components containing oxy-
gen, demonstrate higher knock resistance
and are preferred for use in higher-compres-
sion engines.

Processing of gasolines
Crude oil cannot be used directly in gasoline
engines, but must be processed first in re-
fineries. Primarily the following processes
are used to refine crude oil:
(cid:2) Hydrocarbon mixtures are separated by

distillation in accordance with the boiling
characteristics into fractions, i.e., groups
of different molecule sizes

(cid:2) Larger hydrocarbon molecules deriving
from distillation are split up by cracking
into smaller molecules

(cid:2) The molecular structure of hydrocarbons
is altered by reforming, e.g., paraffins can
be converted into higher-octane aromatics
(cid:2) Unwanted constituents are removed from
hydrocarbons in the refining process (e.g.,
desulfurization of sulfurous components)

Fuel standards
The European standard EN 228 (Table 1)
defines the requirements for unleaded
 gasoline for use in spark-ignition engines.
Further, country-specific characteristic val-
ues are set out in the national appendices 
to this standard. Leaded gasolines are now
prohibited in Europe.

The US specifications defining fuels for

spark-ignition engines are contained in
ASTM D 4814 (American Society for Testing
and Materials). 

Characteristic quantities
Calorific value
Normally the net calorific value Hn is speci-
fied for the energy content of fuels; it corre-
sponds to the usable heat quantity released
during full combustion. The gross calorific
value Hg, on the other hand, specifies the to-
tal reaction heat released and therefore com-
prises as well as the usable heat the latent
heat in the water vapor created. However,
this component is not used in the vehicle.
The net calorific value of gasoline is
40.1…41.8 MJ/kg. 

Oxygenates, i.e. fuels or fuel constituents
containing oxygen, such as alcohol fuels,
ether, or fatty-acid methyl ester, have a lower
calorific value than pure hydrocarbons
 because the oxygen bonded in them does
not contribute to the combustion process.
Comparable engine power with conven-
tional fuels therefore results in higher fuel
consumption.

Calorific value of air/fuel mixture
The calorific value of the combustible
air/fuel mixture determines engine power
output. With a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio,
this is roughly 3.5…3.7 MJ/m3 for all liquid
fuels and liquified petroleum gases.

Density
European standard EN 228 limits the den-
sity of gasolines to 720...775 kg/m3. Because
premium fuels generally include a higher
proportion of aromatic compounds, they
are denser than regular gasoline, and also
have a slightly higher calorific value.

Knock resistance (octane number)
The octane number defines the knock resis-
tance of a particular gasoline. The higher 
the octane number, the greater the resistance
to engine knock. Iso-octane (trimethyl pen-
tane), which is extremely knock-resistant, 
is assigned the octane number 100, while 
n-heptane, which is extremely knock-sus-
ceptible, is assigned the number 0.

The octane number of a fuel is determined
in a standardized test engine: The numerical
value corresponds to the proportion (percent
by volume) of iso-octane in an iso-octane/
n-heptane mixture which demonstrates the
same knock characteristics as the fuel to be
tested.

26

Fuels

Fuels for spark-ignition engines (gasolines)

RON, MON
The number determined in testing using the
Research Method is the Research Octane
Number, or RON. It serves as the essential
index of acceleration knock. The Motor
 Octane Number, or MON, is derived from
testing according to the Motor Method. 
The MON basically provides an indication
of the tendency to knock at high speeds. 
The Motor Method differs from the Re-
search Method by using preheated mixtures,
higher engine speeds and variable ignition
timing, thereby placing more stringent
 thermal demands on the fuel under exami-
nation. MON figures are lower than those 
for RON.

Enhancing knock resistance
Normal (untreated) straight-run gasoline
has only limited resistance to knock. Only by
mixing such gasoline with different knock-
resistant refinery components (rexformed
components, isomerisates) is it possible to
produce high-octane fuels for modern en-
gines. It is also important to maintain the

highest possible octane level throughout the
entire boiling range. It is possible to increase
knock resistance to good effect by adding
components containing oxygen. Ethers (e.g.,
MTBE: methyl tertiary butyl ether, ETBE:
ethyl tertiary butyl ether, 3...15 %) and alco-
hols (methanol, ethanol) are used. The fol-
lowing are permitted by way of example: in
Europe E5 (max. 5 % ethanol), in the USA
E10 and in Brazil E22…E26. 

However, adding alcohols can also give rise
to difficulties. Alcohols increase volatility, can
damage the materials used in the fuel-injec-
tion equipment, and may cause, for example,
elastomer swelling and corrosion. 

Octane-number improvers (e.g., MMT:
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricar-
bonyl) form ashes during combustion and
are therefore used only occasionally (e.g., in
Canada).

Volatility
The volatility of gasoline has both upper and
lower limits. On the one hand, they must
contain an adequate proportion of highly

volatile components to ensure reliable cold
starting. At the same time, volatility should
not be so high as to lead to starting and
 performance problems during operation 
in high-temperature environments (“vapor
lock”). Still another factor is environmental
protection, which demands that evaporative
losses be kept low.

Fuel volatility is defined by different charac-
teristic quantities. EN 228 defines 10 differ-
ent volatility classes distinguished by various
levels of boiling curve, vapor pressure and
VLI (Vapor-Lock Index). To meet special re-
quirements stemming from variations in cli-
matic conditions, countries can incorporate
specific individual classes into their own na-
tional appendices to the standard. Different
values are laid down for summer and winter. 

Boiling curve
In order to assess the fuel with regard to its
performance, it is necessary to view the indi-
vidual areas of the boiling curve separately.
EN 228 therefore contains limit values laid
down for the volume of fuel that vaporizes
at 70 °C, at 100 °C and at 150 °C. The volume
of fuel that vaporizes up to 70 °C must
achieve a minimum volume in order to
 ensure that the engine starts easily when
cold (previously important for vehicles with
carburetors). However, the volume of fuel
that vaporizes must not be too great either
because otherwise vapor bubbles may be
formed when the engine is hot. While the
volume of fuel that vaporizes up to 100 °C
determines the engine’s warm-up character-
istics, this factor’s most pronounced effects
are reflected in the acceleration and response
provided by the engine once it warms to
normal operating temperature. The volume
of fuel that vaporizes up to 150 °C should be
high enough to minimize dilution of the en-
gine oil. Especially when the engine is cold,
the non-volatile gasoline components find it
difficult to vaporize and can pass from the
combustion chamber via the cylinder walls
into the engine oil.

Vapor pressure
Fuel vapor pressure as measured at 37.8 °C
(100 °F) in accordance with EN 13016-1 is
primarily an index of the safety with which
the fuel can be pumped into and out of the
vehicle’s tank. Vapor pressure has upper and
lower limits in all specifications. In Germany,
for example, it is max. 60 kPa in summer and
max. 90 kPa in winter.

In order to configure a fuel-injection system,
it is also important to know the vapor pres-
sure at higher temperatures (80...100 °C) be-
cause a rise in the vapor pressure due to the
admixture of alcohol, for example, becomes
apparent particularly at higher temperatures.
If the fuel vapor pressure rises above the fuel-
injection system pressure for example during
vehicle operation due to the effect of the en-
gine temperature, this may result in malfunc-
tions caused by vapor-bubble formation.

Vapor/liquid ratio
The vapor/liquid ratio is a measure of a
fuel’s tendency to form bubbles. It refers to
the volume of vapor generated by a specific
quantity of fuel at a defined back pressure
and a defined temperature.

If the back pressure drops (e.g., when
 driving over a mountain pass) and/or the
temperature rises, this will raise the vapor/
liquid ratio and with it the probability of
operating problems. ASTM D 4814 lays
down for example for each volatility class 
a temperature at which a vapor/liquid ratio
of 20 must not be exceeded. 

Vapor-lock index (VLI)
The vapor-lock index is the mathematically
calculated sum total of ten times the vapor
pressure (in kPa at 37.8 °C) and seven times
the volume of fuel that vaporizes up to
70 °C. The properties of the fuel in terms of
hot-starting and hot-running performance
are described better with the additional
quantity VLI than by the characteristic
 vapor-pressure and boiling values alone.

Fuels

Fuels for spark-ignition engines (gasolines)

Detergent additives
The entire intake system (fuel injectors,
 intake valves) should remain free of contam-
ination and deposits for several reasons. 
A clean intake tract is essential for maintain-
ing the factory-defined air/fuel ratios, as well
as for trouble-free operation and minimal
exhaust emissions. To achieve this end, effec-
tive detergent additives should be added to
the fuel. 

Corrosion inhibitors
The ingress of water/moisture may lead 
to corrosion in fuel-system components.
Corrosion is effectively eliminated by the
 addition of corrosion inhibitors, which form
a thin protective film on the metal surface.

Oxidation stabilizers
Anti-aging agents (antioxidants) are added
to fuels to improve their stability during
storage. They prevent oxidation caused by
oxygen in the air. Metal deactivators prevent
a catalytic influence by metal ions on fuel
aging.

Reformulated gasoline
Reformulated gasoline is the term used to
describe gasoline which, through its altered
composition, generates fewer evaporative
and pollutant emissions than conventional
gasoline. The demands placed on reformu-
lated gasoline are laid down in the US Clean
Air Act of 1990. This legislation prescribes,
for example, lower values for vapor pressure,
aromatic and benzene content, and final
boiling point. It also prescribes the use of
additives to keep the intake system free of
contamination and deposits. 

Sulfur content
In the interests of reducing SO2 emissions
and protecting the catalytic converters for
exhaust-gas treatment, the sulfur content of
gasolines will be limited on a Europe-wide
basis to 10 mg/kg as from 2009. Fuels which
adhere to this limit value are known as
 “sulfur-free fuels”. These have already been
introduced in Germany because a penalty
tax has been levied on sour fuels in that
country since 2003.

Sulfur-free fuels are being introduced

gradually throughout Europe. Since
1. 1. 2005 only low-sulfur fuels (sulfur
 content < 50 mg/kg) have been permitted 
to be brought onto the market. 

In the USA, the limit value for the sulfur
content of gasolines commercially available
to the end user is currently set at max.
300 mg/kg, although an upper average value
of 30 mg/kg for the total amount of sold and
imported fuel has been in place since the
start of 2005. As of 2006, while the average
value of 30 mg/kg is maintained, the limit
will be reduced to max. 80 mg/kg. Individual
states, California for example, have laid
down lower limits. The sulfur content of
certification fuels is subject to separate
 regulation.

Additives
Additives can be added to improve fuel qual-
ity in order to counteract deteriorations in
engine performance and in the exhaust-gas
composition during vehicle operation. The
packages generally used combine individual
components with various attributes.

Extreme care and precision are required

both when testing additives and in deter-
mining their optimal concentrations.
 Undesirable side-effects must be avoided.
They are usually added to the individually
branded fuels at the refinery’s filling stations
when the road tankers are filled (end-point
dosing). Vehicle operators should refrain
from adding supplementary additives of
their own into the vehicle fuel tanks as this
would invalidate the manufacturer’s war-
ranty.

Alternative fuels

Alternative fuels

As well as the processes for producing gaso-
lines and diesel fuels, there are different
technical formulations for producing alter-
native fuels from different sources of energy.
The main creation and conversion processes
are shown in Figure 2. The complete journey
fuel takes in the course of its production and
provision – from primary-energy extraction
through to its introduction in the vehicle’s
fuel tank – is known as the “well to tank”
path. In order to evaluate the different fuel
options with regard to CO2 emissions and
energy balance, it is necessary not only to
 include this entire path but also to take into
account the efficiency of the respective vehi-
cle drive system as it is this latter factor
which determines fuel consumption. It is
not enough simply to evaluate the combus-
tion of the fuel. 

In this context, a distinction is made be-
tween fossil fuels, which are produced on the
basis of crude oil or natural gas, and regen-
erative fuels, which are created from renew-

2

Manufacturing paths of fossil and regenerative fuels

able sources of energy, such as biomass,
wind power or solar power. 

Alternative fossil fuels include liquified
petroleum gas, natural gas, synfuels (syn-
thetic liquid fuels) created from natural gas,
and hydrogen produced from natural gas. 
Regenerative fuels include methane,
methanol and ethanol, provided these fuels
are created from biomass. Further biomass-
based regenerative fuels are sunfuels (syn-
thetic liquid fuels) and biodiesel. Hydrogen
extracted by electrolysis is then classed as
 regenerative if the current used comes from
renewable sources (wind energy, solar en-
ergy). Biomass-based regenerative hydrogen
can also be produced. 

With the sole exception of hydrogen, all
 regenerative and fossil fuels contain carbon
and therefore release CO2 during combus-
tion. In the case of fuels produced from
 biomass, however, the CO2 absorbed by 
the plants as they grow is offset against the
emissions produced during combustion.
The CO2 emissions to be attributed to
 combustion are thereby reduced.

Fuels

Alternative fuels

Alternative fuels for spark-ignition
 engines
Natural gas and liquified petroleum gas are
primarily used as alternative fuels in spark-
ignition engines. Spark-ignition engines that
run on hydrogen are currently restricted to
test vehicles. Alcohols are mainly used in
 Europe and the US as gasoline additives. In
Brazil, pure ethanol is also used as a fuel.
Synthetic fuels are used exclusively in

diesel engines. 

To enable engines to run on many of the
 alternative fuels mentioned, it may be neces-
sary to adapt the fuel-injection components
and where required the vehicle engine and
the fuel tank. Today, more and more vehicle
manufacturers are offering natural-gas
 vehicles straight off the production lines.
 Bivalent vehicles are primarily used here,
i.e., the driver can switch between gasoline
and gas operation.

Natural gas (CNG, LNG)
The primary component of natural gas is
methane (CH4), which is present in propor-
tions of 80...99 %. Further components are
inert gases, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen
and low-chain hydrocarbons.

Natural gas is stored either in gas form 

as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) at a
pressure of 200 bar or as a liquified gas
(LNG: Liquefied Natural Gas) at –162 °C 
in a cold-resistant tank. LNG requires only
one third of the storage volume of CNG,
however the storage of LNG requires a high
 expenditure of energy for cooling. For this
reason, natural gas is offered almost exclu-
sively as CNG at the roughly 550 natural-gas
filling stations in Germany today.

Natural-gas vehicles are characterized by low
CO2 emissions, due to the lower proportion
of carbon in natural gas. The hydrogen-car-
bon ratio of natural gas stands at approx.
4:1, that of gasoline, on the other hand, is
2.3:1. Thus, the process of burning natural
gas produces less CO2 and more H2O. 
A spark-ignition engine converted to natural

gas – without any further optimizations –
already produces roughly 25 % fewer CO2
emissions than a gasoline engine. 

Because of the extremely high knock resis-
tance of natural gas of up to 130 RON
 (gasoline 91...100 RON), the natural-gas
 engine is ideally suited for turbocharging
and enables the compression ratio to be in-
creased. In this way, it is possible in conjunc-
tion with a downsizing concept (reduction
of displacement) to improve engine effi-
ciency and further reduce CO2 emissions.

Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is primarily
a mixture of propane and butane and is used
to a limited extent as a fuel for motor vehi-
cles. It is a by-product of the crude-oil-refin-
ing process and can be liquified under pres-
sure. 

The demands placed on LPG for use in
motor vehicles are laid down in the Euro-
pean standard EN 589. The octane number
MON is at least 89. 

CO2 emissions from an LPG engine are
roughly 10 % lower than from a gasoline
 engine. 

Alcohol fuels
Specially adapted spark-ignition engines can
be run on pure methanol (M100) or ethanol
(E100). These alcohols are, however, mostly
used as fuel components for increasing the
octane number (e.g., E24 in Brazil and E10,
E85, M85 in the USA). Even the ethers that
can be manufactured from these alcohols
MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and
ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether) are impor-
tant octane-number improvers. 

Ethanol, because of its biogenous origin,
has become a highly significant alternative
fuel in some countries, above all in Brazil
(manufactured by fermentation of sugar
cane) and the USA (from wheat). 

Methanol can be manufactured from
readily available natural hydrocarbons
found in plentiful substances such as coal,
natural gas, heavy oils, etc.

Fuels

Alternative fuels

31

Compared with petroleum-based fuels,
 alcohols have different material properties
(calorific value, vapor pressure, material
 resistance, corrosivity, etc.), which must 
be taken into consideration with respect 
to design.

Engines with can burn gasolines and alco-
hols in any mixture ratio without the driver
having to intervene are used in “flexible
fuel” vehicles.

Hydrogen
Hydrogen can be used both in fuel-cell
 drives and directly in internal-combustion
engines. CO2 advantages are enjoyed, partic-
ularly when the hydrogen is created regener-
atively by electrolysis from water or from
biomass. Today, however, hydrogen is pre-
dominantly obtained on a major industrial
scale by means of steam reforming from
natural gas, in the course of which CO2 is
 released. 

Even the distribution and storage of
 hydrogen is still technically complex and
 expensive today. Because of its low density,
hydrogen is mainly stored in one of two
ways: 
(cid:2) Pressure storage at 350 bar or 700 bar; 

at 350 bar, the storage volume referred to
the energy content is 10 times greater than
with gasoline.

(cid:2) Liquid storage at a temperature of –253 °C
(cryogenic storage); this gives rise to four
times the tank volume of gasoline.

Electric drive with fuel-cell power supply
The fuel cell converts hydrogen with oxygen
in the air in a cold-combustion process into
electrical current; the only by-product of
this process is water vapor. The currents
serves to power an electric motor acting as
the vehicle drive. 

Polymer-electrolyte fuel cells (PEM fuel
cells), which operate at relatively low tem-
peratures of 60…100 °C, are primarily used
for the vehicle drive. The system efficiency of
a hydrogen-fueled PEM fuel cell including
electric motor is in the range of 30…40 %
(referred to the New European Driving
 Cycle NEDC) and thus clearly surpasses the
typical efficiency of an internal-combustion
engine of 18...24 %. 

Hydrogen in a spark-ignition engine
Hydrogen is an extremely ignitable fuel. 
Its very high ignition performance permits a
strong leaning of the hydrogen/air mixture
up to approx. λ = 4...5 and thus extensive
dethrottling of the engine. The extended ig-
nition limits compared with gasoline, how-
ever, also increase the risk of backfiring.

The efficiency of a hydrogen combustion

engine is generally higher than that of a
gasoline engine, but lower than that of a
fuel-cell drive. 

The process of burning hydrogen pro-

duces water and no CO2.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Electronic throttle control (ETC)

Cylinder-charge control systems

In the case of a homogeneously operated
gasoline engine with a defined air/fuel ratio
λ, the output torque and thus the power is
determined by the intake-air mass and the
injected fuel quantity. The air mass must 
be proportioned exactly so that λ can be
 adhered to precisely.

Electronic throttle control
(ETC)

For it to burn, fuel needs oxygen, which the
engine takes from the intake air. In engines
with external mixture formation (manifold
injection), as well as in direct-injection en-
gines operating on a homogeneous mixture,
the output torque is directly dependent on
the intake-air mass. The engine must there-
fore be throttled for the purpose of setting 
a defined air charge. 

Function and method of operation
The torque requested by the driver is derived
from the position of the accelerator pedal. 
In the case of the ETC system (Electronic
Throttle Control), a position sensor in the

1

ETC system

accelerator-pedal module (Fig. 1, Pos. 1)
records this variable. Further torque requests
are  derived from functional requests, such
as, for example, an additional torque when
the air-conditioning system is switched on
or a torque reduction during a gearshift. 
The Motronic ECU (2) – ME-Motronic

for systems with manifold injection or 
DI-Motronic for gasoline direct injection –
calculates the required air mass from the
torque to be set and generates the triggering
signals for the electrically actuated throttle
valve (5). In this way, the opening cross-sec-
tion and thus the air-mass flow inducted by
the gasoline engine are set. Using the feed-
back information from the throttle-valve-
angle sensor (3) regarding the current posi-
tion of the throttle valve, it then becomes
possible to adjust the throttle valve precisely
to the required setting. 

A cruise-control function can also be

 easily integrated with ETC. The ECU adjusts
the torque in such a way that the vehicle
speed preselected at the control element 
for cruise control is maintained. There is 
no need to press the accelerator pedal.

Throttle device
The throttle device (Fig. 2) consists of a
housing (1), in which the rotating throttle
valve (2) is mounted. The DC motor (3)
 drives the shaft of the throttle valve via a
gear unit (5). The shaft connects two throt-
tle-valve-angle sensors (ETC monitoring
concept). Potentiometers are used in the
DV-E5 throttle device. Alternatively, proxi -
mity-type sensors are also used in the DV-E8
version. All the connections are connected by
way of a plug to the vehicle wiring harness.

The throttle device is assembled in accor-
dance with a modular principle. This modu-
lar design enables it to be easily adapted to
the relevant requirements – for example, 
the air requirement dependent on the swept
volume of the engine cylinders.

The use of plastic in the DV-E8 offers the
following advantages over the aluminum
housing of the DV-E5:
(cid:2) Weight saving
(cid:2) Optimal throttle-valve geometry
(cid:2) Corrosion resistance
(cid:2) Low wear
(cid:2) Less sensitivity to temperature influences
(cid:2) Less tendency to icing (omission of water

heater)

DV-E8 throttle device, modular design

Accelerator-pedal sensors
In Motronic systems with Electronic Throt-
tle Control (ETC), the pedal-travel sensor
records the travel or the angular position 
of the accelerator pedal. For this purpose,
potentiometers are used in addition to
 proximity-type sensors. 

The pedal-travel sensor is integrated
 together with the accelerator pedal in the
 accelerator-pedal module. These ready- 
to-install units make adjustments on the
 vehicle a thing of the past.

Potentiometric pedal-travel sensor
The engine ECU receives the measured value
picked off at the potentiometer wiper as a
voltage. The ECU uses a stored sensor curve
to convert this voltage into the relative pedal
travel or the angular position of the acceler-
ator pedal (Fig. 3).

A second (redundant) sensor is incorpo-
rated for diagnosis purposes and for use in
case of malfunctions. It is a component part
of the monitoring system. One sensor ver-
sion operates with a second potentiometer,
which always delivers half the voltage of the
first potentiometer at all operating points.
Thus, two independent signals are available
for fault-detection purposes (Fig. 3). Instead
of the second potentiometer, another ver-
sion uses a low-idle switch, which signals the

idle position to the ECU. The status of this
switch and the potentiometer voltage must
be plausible.

For vehicles with automatic transmis-
sions, a further switch can be incorporated
for an electrical kickdown signal. Alterna-
tively, this information can also be derived
from the rate of change of the potentiometer
voltage. A further possibility is to trigger the
kickdown function by means of a defined
voltage value of the sensor curve; here, the
driver receives feedback on a jump in force
in a mechanical kickdown cell. This is the
most frequently used solution.

Hall-effect angle-of-rotation sensors
Hall-effect sensors are used to measure the
movement of the accelerator pedal on a
non-contact basis. In the case of the Type
ARS1 Hall-effect angle-of-rotation sensor,
the magnetic flux of a roughly semicircular,
permanent-magnetic disk is fed back via a
pole shoe, two further conductive elements
and the similarly ferromagnetic shaft to the
magnet (Fig. 4). Depending upon the angu-
lar setting, the flux is led to a greater or
lesser degree through the two conductive
 elements, in the magnetic path of which a
Hall-effect sensor is also situated. Using this
principle, it is possible to achieve a practi-
cally linear characteristic in the measuring
range of 90°.

The Type ARS2 is a simplified version
which does without soft magnetic conduc-
tive elements (Fig. 5). In this version, the
magnet moves around the Hall-effect sensor
in a circular arc. Only a relatively small sec-
tion of the resulting sinusoidal characteristic
curve features good linearity. If the Hall-
 effect sensor is located slightly outside the
center of the circular arc, the characteristic
curve increasingly deviates from the sinu-
soidal, and now features a short measuring
range of almost 90°, and a longer measuring
range of more than 180° with good linearity.

ETC monitoring concept
The ETC system is classified as a safety-
 related system. The engine-management
 system therefore contains the facility for di-
agnosing the individual components. Input
information representing the power-deter-
mining driver command (accelerator-pedal
position) or the engine status (throttle-valve
position) is directed to the ECU by two sen-
sors (redundancy). The two sensors in the
accelerator-pedal module and the two sen-
sors in the throttle device supply signals 
that are independent of each other to such
an extent that, if one signal should fail, the
other signal supplies a valid value. Different
characteristic curves ensure that a short 
circuit between the two signals is detected.

A great disadvantage though is the low level
of shielding against external fields, as well as
the remaining dependence on the geometric
tolerances of the magnetic circuit, and the
intensity fluctuations of the magnetic flux 
in the permanent magnet as a function of
temperature and age.

In the case of the FPM2.3 Type Hall-effect

angle-of-rotation sensor, it is not the field
strength but rather the direction of the mag-
netic field which is used to generate the out-
put signal. The field lines are recorded by
four radially arranged measuring elements
lying in one plane in the x- and y-directions
(Fig. 6). The output signals are derived in
the ASIC from the raw data (cos and sin sig-
nals) using the arctan function. The sensor
is positioned between two magnets to gener-
ate a homogenous magnetic field. The sen-
sor is therefore insensitive to component
tolerances and temperature-resistant.

As with the accelerator-pedal module with

a potentiometric sensor, these proximity-
type systems also contain two sensors in or-
der to receive two redundant voltage signals.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Variable valve timing

Variable valve timing

In addition to controlling the fresh-gas flow
inducted by the engine via the throttle valve,
it is possible to adjust the cylinder charge
with the aid of variable valve timing. It is
possible to use the variability of valve timing
and valve lifts to influence the ratio of fresh
gas to residual gas and mixture formation.

Periodic opening and closing of the valves
causes the fresh gas to be inducted spasmod-
ically into the combustion chamber and the
burnt gases to be forced out of the chamber.
This stimulates the gas columns flowing in
and out to vibrate. The frequency and am-
plitude of the vibrations are very much de-
pendent on the geometry of the air duct 
and the exhaust-system branch, the engine
speed, and the throttle-valve position. 
Valve timing and valve lifts can thus only be
adapted to the best possible extent for the
gas-exchange process in a specific operating
range. An invariant design of the valve gear
for a production engine will therefore always
constitute a compromise over the entire load
and engine-speed range. Variable valve tim-
ing facilitates extended adaptation to differ-
ent operating conditions, from which the
following benefits are derived:
(cid:2) Higher rated power
(cid:2) Favorable torque curve over the entire

 engine-speed range

(cid:2) Reduction of toxic emissions
(cid:2) Reduced fuel consumption, and
(cid:2) Improved smooth running at low engine

speeds

Camshaft phase adjustment
In today’s production engines, the camshafts
are driven from the crankshaft via toothed
belts, timing chains or gearwheels. Adjusting
the camshafts relative to the crankshaft posi-
tion is becoming increasingly more impor-
tant. In many applications, only the intake
camshaft is designed to be rotated in rela-
tion to the crankshaft position. However, 
the tendency is now towards engines with
additionally adjustable exhaust camshafts.

Hydraulically driven actuators, which per-
mit continuous adjustment, are used pre-
dominantly in this context.

Rotating the intake camshaft, for example,
determines the time of “Intake Opens”. Via
the fixed cam-lobe profile the same lifting
curve and thus also “Intake Closes” are dis-
placed in parallel. Figure 1 shows the dis-
placement of the lifting curve of an intake
valve with regard to the top dead center of
the  piston when the intake camshaft is ro-
tated in the “Retard” or “Advance” direction.

Timing retardation of the intake camshaft
Timing retardation at low engine speeds
Timing retardation of the intake camshaft
leads to the intake valve opening later so that
valve overlap is reduced. This reduces the
amount of burnt gases flowing back via the
intake valve into the intake manifold. The
lower residual-gas content of the mixture
then inducted results at low engine speeds
(< 2000 rpm) in more stable combustion
and smoother engine operation. The idle
speed can be lowered, which in particular
reduces the fuel consumption.

Timing retardation at high engine speeds 
The camshaft is also retarded at high engine
speeds (> 5000 rpm). Because of the associ-
ated later closing of the intake valve after
BDC, the fresh gas has as much time to flow
into the cylinder until the pressure differen-
tial is compensated via the intake valve by
the continuing upwards stroke of the piston.
This boost effect helps to increase the cylin-
der charge significantly.

Timing advance of the intake camshaft
Timing advance at middle engine speeds
In the middle speed range, there is no boost
effect, due to the changed gas dynamics. The
early closing of the intake valve shortly after
BDC prevents the upward-moving piston
under these conditions from forcing the in-
ducted fresh gas back into the intake mani-
fold. This results in the best possible charge
and with it a good torque curve.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Variable valve timing

37

Timing advance of the intake camshaft also
means a larger valve overlap. The early
opening of the intake valve before TDC
causes burnt residual gas to be forced by 
the upward stroke of the piston via the open
valve into the intake manifold and then 
inducted again. The upshot of this is an 
increased proportion of residual gas in the
cylinder charge (internal exhaust-gas recir-
culation). This in turn lowers the peak com-
bustion temperatures and reduces NOX for-
mation. The higher proportion of inert gas
also permits further opening of the throttle
valve (dethrottling) and thereby results in a
reduction of the fuel consumption associ-
ated with throttling losses.

Adjustment of the exhaust camshaft
In addition, it is possible with systems 
in which the exhaust camshaft is also ad-
justable to adjust the proportion of residual
gas by choosing the point at which the ex-
haust valve closes. This facilitates a largely
isolated adjustment of optimal charge with
fresh gas (Intake Closes) and residual-gas
content.

Camshaft-lobe control
Camshaft-lobe control (Fig. 2) involves
 alternating between different cam-lobe pro-
files. In this way, both the valve-lifting curve
and the timing can be varied. Generally, 
a first cam determines the optimal timing
and the valve lift for the lower and middle
engine-speed ranges, while at high engine
speeds and loads the arrangement switches
to a second cam with a greater valve lift and
longer opening duration.

Alternation between the different cams is
achieved, for example, by bucket tappets or
by cutting in an otherwise freely vibrating
rocker arm on an additional cam.

Alternation in the lower and middle  
engine-speed ranges
In the lower and middle engine-speed
ranges, the narrower valve gap associated
with a small valve lift results in a higher
 admission speed and better swirling of the
charge gas (in the case of gasoline direct in-
jection) or of the air/fuel mixture (in the
case of manifold injection). This ensures
good mixture formation even at part load.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Variable valve timing

Alternation in the upper engine-speed range
A high torque request (full load) calls for
maximum charge. The opening cross-sec-
tion widened by the large valve lift allows
fresh gas to flow in relatively unhindered
and reduces the pumping losses.

Fully variable valve timing with camshaft
Valve timing in which both the valve lift and
the timing can be continuously varied is
known as fully variable valve gear. Spatial
cam-lobe profiles in conjunction with an ax-
ially adjustable camshaft (Fig. 3) or variable
lever-arm geometries can adjust the valve lift
and the opening duration. Additional phase
adjusters determine the phase position. This
fully variable valve timing facilitates exten-
sive dethrottling through specific opening
and closing of the intake valve. This enables
fuel consumption to be further reduced in
comparison with simple variation of the
timing.

Fully variable valve timing without
camshaft
The greatest degree of freedom for valve
timing and the greatest potential for reduc-
ing consumption are afforded by camshaft-
free systems. Here the valves are operated,
for example, by electromagnetic or electro-
hydraulic actuators. A supplementary ECU
is responsible for triggering. The purpose of
these camshaft-free fully variable valve gears
is to achieve the best possible dethrottling,
coupled with very low pumping losses. 
The extensive variability of the valve gear
provides for the best possible charge and
with it maximum torque as well as improved
mixture preparation. Additional fuel savings
can be achieved by incorporating valve and
cylinder shutoff. However, technical risks
and high costs stand in the way of the gen-
eral introduction of such systems in the
short term.

Dynamic supercharging

39

Dynamic supercharging

Approximately speaking, the achievable en-
gine torque is proportional to the fresh-gas
content in the cylinder charge. This means
that the maximum torque can be increased
to a certain extent by compressing the air
before it enters the cylinder. 

The gas-exchange processes are not only in-
fluenced by the valve timing, but also by the
intake and exhaust lines. The piston’s induc-
tion work causes the open intake valve to
trigger a return pressure wave. At the open
end of the intake manifold, the pressure
wave encounters the quiescent ambient air
from which it is reflected back again so that
it returns in the direction of the intake valve.
The resulting pressure fluctuations at the
 intake valve can be utilized to increase the
fresh-gas charge and thus achieve the high-
est possible torque. 

This supercharging effect thus depends on
utilization of the incoming air’s dynamic re-
sponse. In the intake manifold, the dynamic
effects depend upon the geometrical rela-
tionships in the intake manifold and on the
engine speed.

For the even distribution of the air/fuel mix-
ture, the intake manifolds for carburetor en-
gines and single-point injection must have
short pipes which as far as possible must be
of the same length for all cylinders. In the
case of multi-point injection, the fuel is ei-
ther injected into the intake manifold onto
the intake valve (manifold  injection), or it is
injected directly into the combustion cham-
ber (gasoline direct injection). The intake
manifolds essentially carry air only. This
opens up more varied possibilities for in-
take-manifold layout because practically no
fuel can be precipitated on the intake mani-
folds. This is the reason for there being no
problems with multi-point injection systems
regarding the even distribution of fuel.

Ram-tube supercharging
The intake manifolds for multi-point injec-
tion systems are composed of the individual
resonance tubes or runners and the mani-
fold chamber. 

In the case of ram-tube supercharging
(Fig. 1), each cylinder is allocated its own
 individual resonance tube (2) of specific
length which is usually attached to the 
manifold chamber (3). The pressure waves
are able to propagate in the individual 
resonance tubes independently. 

The supercharging effect depends upon
the intake-manifold geometry and the en-
gine speed. For this reason, the length and
diameter of the individual resonance tubes
are matched to the valve timing so that in
the required speed range a pressure wave
 reflected at the end of the resonance tube 
is able to enter the cylinder (1) through the
open intake valve and improve the cylinder
charge. Long, narrow tubes result in a
marked supercharging effect at low engine
speeds. On the other hand, short, large- 
dia meter tubes have a positive effect on 
the torque curve at higher engine speeds.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Dynamic supercharging

Variable-geometry intake-manifolds
The supplementary cylinder charge resulting
from dynamic supercharging depends on
the engine’s operating point. The two sys-
tems just dealt with increase the achievable
maximum charge (volumetric efficiency),
above all in the low engine-speed range 
(Fig. 3).

Practically ideal torque characteristics can
be achieved with variable-geometry intake-
manifolds in which, as a function of the 
engine operating point, flaps are used to im-
plement a variety of different adjustments
such as:
(cid:2) Adjustment of the ram-tube length
(cid:2) Switchover between different ram-tube
lengths or different tube diameters

(cid:2) Selected switchoff of one of the cylinder’s
intake tubes on multiple-tube systems
(cid:2) Switchover to different chamber volumes

Electrically or electropneumatically actuated
flaps are used for changeover operations in
these variable-geometry systems. 

Tuned-intake pressure charging
At a given engine speed, the periodic piston
movement causes the intake-manifold gas
column to vibrate at resonant frequency.
This results in a further increase of pressure
and leads to an additional supercharging
 effect.

In the tuned-intake-tube system (Fig. 2),
groups of cylinders (1) with identical angu-
lar ignition spacing are each connected to a
resonance chamber (3) through short tubes
(2). The chambers, in turn, are connected
through tuned intake tubes (4) with either
atmosphere or with the manifold chamber
(5) and function as Helmholtz resonators.
The subdivision into two groups of cylinders
each with its own tuned intake tube prevents
the overlapping of the flow processes of two
neighboring cylinders which are adjacent to
each other in the firing sequence.

The length of the tuned intake tubes and

the size of the resonance chamber are a
function of the speed range in which the
 supercharging effect due to resonance is 
required to be at maximum. Due to the 
accumulator effect of the considerable
chamber volumes which are sometimes
needed, dynamic-response errors can occur
in some cases when the load is changed
abruptly.

Ram-tube systems
The manifold system shown in Fig. 4 can
switch between two different ram tubes. 
In the lower speed range, the changeover
flap (1) is closed and the intake air flows to
the cylinders through the long ram tube (3).
At higher speeds and with the changeover
flap open, the intake air flows through the
short, wide diameter ram tube (4), and thus
contributes to improved cylinder charge at
high engine speeds.

Tuned-intake-tube systems
Opening the resonance flap switches in 
a second tuned intake tube. The changed
geometry of this configuration has an effect
upon the resonant frequency of the intake
system. Cylinder charge in the lower speed
range is improved by the higher effective
volume resulting from the second tuned
 intake pipe.

Combined tuned-intake-tube and 
ram-tube system
When design permits the open changeover
flap (Fig. 5, Pos. 7) to combine both the
 resonance chambers (3) to form a single
 volume, one speaks of a combined tuned-
 intake-tube and ram-tube system. A single
intake-air chamber with a high resonant
 frequency is then formed for the short ram
tubes (2). 

The changeover flap is closed at low and
middle speeds. The system acts as a tuned-
intake-tube system. The low resonant fre-
quency is then defined by the long tuned
 intake tube (4).

Mechanical supercharging

Advantages and disadvantages
On the mechanical supercharger, the direct
coupling between compressor and engine
crankshaft means that when engine speed
 increases there is no delay in supercharger 
acceleration. This means therefore, that com-
pared to exhaust-gas turbocharging  engine
torque is higher and dynamic  response is 
better. 

Since the power required to drive the com-
pressor is not available as effective engine
power, the above advantage is counteracted
by a slightly higher fuel-consumption figure
compared to the exhaust-gas turbocharger.
This disadvantage though is somewhat
 alleviated when the engine management 
is able to switch off the compressor via a
clutch at low engine loading.

Mechanical supercharging

Design and method of operation
The application of supercharging units leads
to increased cylinder charge and therefore to
increased torque. Mechanical supercharging
uses a compressor which is driven directly 
by the IC engine. Mechanically driven com-
pressors are either positive-displacement
 superchargers with different types of con-
struction (e.g. Roots supercharger, sliding-
vane supercharger, spiral-type supercharger,
screw-type supercharger), or they are cen-
trifugal turbo-compressors (e.g. radial-flow
compressor). Fig. 1 shows the principle of
functioning of the rotary-screw supercharger
with the two counter-rotating screw elements.
As a rule, engine and compressor speeds are
directly coupled to one another through a
belt drive. 

Boost-pressure control
On the mechanical supercharger, a bypass can
be applied to control the boost pressure. A
portion of the compressd air is directed into
the cylinder and the remainder is returned to
the supercharger input via the bypass. The
engine management is responsible for con-
trolling the bypass valve.

In 1938 the Type 770 “Grand Mercedes”
(W150) was introduced at the Berlin Motor and
Motorcycle Show. It featured a 7.7-liter, eight-
cylinder in-line engine with compressor. This
engine developed a power output of 230 HP.
Compared with today's compressor en-
gines, the power output per engine size then
was rather modest. The Mercedes SLK,
launched in the late 1990s, develops 192 HP
from a 2.3-l engine at 5300 rpm.

History of compressor-engine automobiles

At the 1921 Berlin Motor Show, the 
“Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft” introduced
the passenger cars designated Type 6/20 HP
and 10/35 HP, each featuring a four-cylinder
compressor engine. 

1922 marked the first time a vehicle pow-
ered by a compressor engine was entered in
a car race. At the Targa Florio on the island of
Sicily, Max Sailer drove a 28/95 HP Mercedes
equipped with a compressor engine to victory
in the production-car category. 

In 1924 the new Mercedes 15/70/100 HP
and 24/100/140 HP passenger cars with six-
cylinder compressor engines were introduced
at the Berlin Motor Show. On the Avus race
track in Berlin that same year, NSU set spec-
tacular speed records and victories with their
5/15 compressor racing car. 

In 1927 the Type “S” Mercedes-Benz cap-

tured a triple victory at the inaugural race at
the new Nuerburgring race track. The champi-
onship was won by Rudolf Caracciola. With
its 6.8-litre displacement, the 6-cylinder com-
pressor engine of the Type “S” delivered
180 HP and 120 HP without compressor. 
In 1932 Manfred von Brauchitsch, driving an
“SSKL” (abbreviation for the German “super-
sport-short-light”) won the Avus race in Berlin,
 establishing a world record for this category at
200 km/h. The “SSKL” represented the final
stage in the development of the “S” series. 

The era of the Silver Arrows began in 1934. 

The very first time they were seen was at the
International Eifel Race on the Nuerburgring. 
It ended with pilot von Brauchitsch winning
and establishing a new speed record. In 1938
it was a streamlined Silver Arrow that estab-
lished a speed record on public motorways
that remains unbroken to this day: 426.6 km/h
at 1 km, with a flying start. Silver Arrows with
compressor engines were also built by Auto-
Union; they engaged in riveting duels with the
Mercedes-built Silver Arrows. 

1934 saw the introduction of the Mercedes
Type 500K featuring an 8-cylinder compressor
engine. The successor model launched in 1936

Exhaust-gas turbocharging

Exhaust-gas turbocharging

Of all the possible methods for supercharg-
ing the internal-combustion engine, ex-
haust-gas turbocharging is the most widely
used. Even on engines with low swept vol-
umes, exhaust-gas supercharging leads to
high torques and power outputs together
with high levels of engine efficiency.

Whereas, in the past, exhaust-gas turbo -
charging was utilized in the quest for in-
creased power output, it is today mostly
used in order to increase the maximum
torque at very low engine speeds. On the
other hand, downsizing concepts are possi-
ble; while maintaining comparable engine
power, it is possible to reduce engine dis-
placement and lower fuel consumption. 
This applies in particular to turbocharged
engines with gasoline direct injection.

Design and method of operation
The main components of the exhaust-gas
turbocharger (Fig. 1) are the exhaust-gas
turbine (3) and the compressor (1). The
compressor impeller and the turbine rotor
are mounted on a common shaft (2). This
component is located in the exhaust-gas sys-
tem so that the flow of exhaust gas can drive
the turbine (Fig. 2, Pos. 14). The compressor
(12) compresses the inducted air and
thereby increases the cylinder charge. In the
process of being compressed, the intake air
is heated up. As a result, the intake air passes
through an intercooler (5) to reduce its tem-
perature again.

The energy for driving the exhaust-gas
 turbine is for the most part taken from the
exhaust gas. The energy utilized here is con-
tained in the hot and pressurized exhaust
gas. On the other hand, energy must be also
used to “dam” the exhaust gas when it leaves
the engine so as to generate the required
compressor power.

Exhaust-gas turbocharging

45

The hot exhaust gas (Fig. 3, Pos. 7) flows
into the exhaust-gas turbine (4) in a radial
direction and, by so doing, forces it to rotate
at high speeds (up to approx. 250,000 rpm).
The turbine-rotor blades direct the exhaust
gas to the center, from where it then exits
 axially.

The compressor (3) also turns along with
the turbine, but here the flow conditions are
reversed. The fresh incoming air (5) enters
axially at the center of the compressor and is
forced radially to the outside by the blades
and compressed in the process. 

In order to prevent the compressor from
pumping and generating unwanted addi-
tional noise or even suffering damage, the
divert-air valve (Fig. 2, Pos. 9) in the com-
pressor bypass passage is opened when the
throttle valve (2) is closed.

The turbine of the exhaust-gas turbocharger
is situated in the hot exhaust-gas system. 
It therefore has to be made of highly heat-
resistant materials.

n ≤ 2000 rpm. In order to prevent the  turbo -
charger from overloading the engine at
higher exhaust-gas mass flow rates, it is nec-
essary in this range for some of the exhaust
flow to be discharged via a bypass valve, the
wastegate (Fig. 3, Pos. 8), past the turbine
into the exhaust system. This flap-type
 bypass valve is usually integrated into the
turbine housing. 

 exhaust-gas mass flow used to power the
turbine is increased.

If, on the other hand, the boost pressure is
excessive, the pulse valve is triggered so that
a somewhat higher pressure is built up in
the control line. The boost-pressure control
valve then opens the wastegate and the pro-
portion of the exhaust-gas mass flow used 
to power the turbine is reduced.

The wastegate is actuated by the boost-pres-
sure control valve (6). This valve is con-
nected pneumatically to the pulse valve (1)
through a control line (2). The pulse valve
changes the boost pressure upon being trig-
gered by an electrical signal from the engine
ECU. This electrical signal is a function of
the current boost pressure, information on
which is provided by the Boost-Pressure
Sensor (BPS). 

If the boost pressure is too low, the pulse
valve is triggered so that a somewhat lower
pressure prevails in the control line. The
boost-pressure control valve then closes 
the wastegate and the proportion of the

VTG turbocharger
Variable turbines (VTG: Variable Turbine
Geometry) offer another way of limiting 
the exhaust-gas mass flow at higher engine
speeds (Fig. 4). The VTG turbocharger is
state-of-the-art technology in diesel engines.
It has not been able to establish itself as the
preferred choice for gasoline engines be-
cause of the high thermal stresses caused 
by the higher exhaust-gas temperatures.

By varying the geometry, the adjustable
guide vanes (3) adapt the flow cross-section,
and with it the gas pressure at the turbine, to
the required boost pressure. At low speeds,
they open up a small cross-section so that
the exhaust-gas mass flow in the turbine
reaches a high speed and in doing so also
brings the exhaust-gas turbine up to high
speed (Fig. 4a). 

At high engine speeds, the adjustable
guide vanes open up a larger cross-section
so that more exhaust gas can enter without
accelerating the exhaust-gas turbine to ex-
cessive speeds (Fig. 4b). This limits the boost
pressure.

The guide-vane angle is adjusted very
simply by turning an adjusting ring (2). 
This sets the guide vanes to the desired angle
by operating them either directly using ad-
justing levers (4) attached to the vanes or
 indirectly by means of adjuster cams. The
adjusting ring is rotated pneumatically via 
a barometric adjustment cell (5) using vac-
uum pressure, or electrically. The engine-
management system actuates the adjusting
mechanism. Thus, the turbocharger pressure
can be adjusted to the optimum setting in
response to the engine operating state.

Advantages and disadvantages 
of  exhaust-gas turbocharging
Compared with a naturally aspirated engine
with the same output power, the major ad-
vantages are to be found in the turbo charged
engine’s lower weight and smaller size
(down sizing). The turbocharged engine’s
torque characteristic is better throughout the
usable speed range (Fig. 5, curve 4 compared
to curve 3). All in all, at a given speed, this 
results in a higher output (A (cid:2) B). 

Due to its more favorable torque charac-
teristic at full load, the turbocharged engine
generates the required power as shown in
Fig. 5 (B or C) at lower engine speeds than
the naturally aspirated engine. At part load
the throttle valve must be opened further. 
In this way, the operating point is moved to
a range with smaller frictional and throttling
losses (C (cid:2) B). This results in lower fuel-
consumption figures even though turbo -
charged engines in fact feature less favorable
thermodynamic efficiency figures due to
their lower compression ratio. 

The low torque that is available at very low
engine speeds is a disadvantage of the turbo -
charger. In such speed ranges, there is not
enough energy in the exhaust gas to drive
the exhaust-gas turbine. In transient opera-
tion, even in the medium-speed range, 
the torque curve is less favorable than that 
of the naturally aspirated engine (curve 5).
This is due to the delay in building up the
exhaust-gas mass flow. On acceleration from
slow speeds, therefore, the “turbo lag” effect
 occurs.

Turbo lag can be minimized by making
full use of dynamic charge. This supports
the turbocharger’s running-up characteris-
tic. 

Intercooling

Air is heated as it is compressed in the
turbo charger. Since hot air is less dense 
than cold air, a higher air temperature 
has a negative effect on cylinder charge. 
The compressed, warmed air must therefore
be cooled off again by the intercooler.
Charge-air cooling, or intercooling, there-
fore increases the cylinder charge compared
with turbocharged engines without inter-
cooling. A further increase in torque and
power output is thus possible.

The drop in the combustion-air tempera-
ture also leads to a reduction in the temper-
ature of the cylinder charge compressed
during the compression cycle. This has a
number of advantages:
(cid:2) Reduced tendency to knock
(cid:2) Improved thermal efficiency resulting in

lower fuel-consumption figures

(cid:2) Reduced thermal loading of the pistons
(cid:2) Lower NOX emissions
(cid:2) Higher power yield

Cylinder-charge control systems

Controlled charge flow

Technical implementation of a charge-air
control valve is difficult in manifold-injec-
tion systems. This is because it is necessary
to stop fuel from accumulating ahead of the
valve when it is closed and from passing into
the combustion chamber when it is opened.

Flow movements in the combustion chamber

Controlled charge flow

The airflow behavior in both intake mani-
fold and cylinder is an essential factor in
forming an ideal air/fuel mixture. A vigor-
ous charge-flow movement ensures that the
air-fuel mixture is well blended to achieve
excellent, low-pollutant combustion.

Charge-flow control valve
In systems with gasoline direct injection, a
controlled or switched charge-flow control
valve (i.e., continuous adjustment or two
settings) is used to generate a vigorous
charge flow. In the intake-valve area, the
 intake manifold is typically split into two
channels, one of which can be closed by
means of a flap, the charge-flow control
valve (Fig. 1). This valve, in combination
with the geometry of the intake area, causes
the mixture to adopt a tumbling or swirling
motion in the combustion chamber (Fig. 2). 

The charge-flow control valve allows the in-
tensity of the charge flow to be controlled.
In stratified-charge mode (wall-directed
combustion), the flow moved in this way
makes sure that the mixture is conveyed to
the spark plug. It supports mixture forma-
tion at the same time. 

In homogeneous-charge mode, the

charge-flow control valve is normally closed
at low torques and rotational speeds. The
charge-flow control valve must be opened at
high torques and speeds. Otherwise, it is not
possible to introduce the air required for
high power into the combustion chamber
because the charge-flow control valve closes
part of the flow cross-section. Ideal mixture
formation is achieved, even without in-
creased charge flow, simply by advancing
fuel injection into the combustion chamber
(as early as the induction stroke) at a high
temperature.

Exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) 

49

Exhaust-gas recirculation
(EGR)

The mass of the residual gas remaining 
in the cylinder, and with it the inert-gas
 content of the cylinder charge, can be influ-
enced by varying the valve timing. In this
case, one refers to “internal” EGR. The inert-
gas content can be influenced far more by
applying “external” EGR with which part 
of the exhaust gas which has already left 
the cylinder is directed back into the intake
manifold through a special line (Fig. 1,
Pos. 3). EGR leads to a reduction of the
NOX emissions and to a slightly lower  
fuel-consumption figure.

Limiting the NOX emissions
Since they are highly dependent upon tem-
perature, EGR is highly effective in reducing
NOX emissions. When peak combustion
temperature is lowered by introducing 
burnt exhaust gas to the air/fuel mixture,
NOX emissions drop accordingly. 

Lowering fuel consumption
When EGR is applied, the overall cylinder
charge increases while the charge of fresh 
air remains constant. This means that the
throttle valve (2) must reduce the engine
throttling if a given torque is to be achieved.
Fuel consumption drops as a result.

EGR: Method of operation
Depending upon the engine’s operating
point, the engine ECU (4) triggers the EGR
valve (5) and defines its opened cross-sec-
tion. Part of the exhaust gas (6) is diverted
via this opened cross-section (3) and mixed
with the incoming fresh air (1). This defines
the exhaust-gas content of the cylinder
charge. 

EGR with gasoline direct injection
EGR is also used on gasoline direct-injection
engines to reduce NOX emissions and fuel
consumption. In fact, it is absolutely essen-
tial since with it NOX emissions can be
 lowered to such an extent in lean-burn
 operations that other emissions-reduction
measures can be reduced accordingly (for
 instance, rich homogeneous operation for
NOX “Removal” from the NOX accumulator-
type catalytic converter). EGR also has a
 favorable effect on fuel consumption. 

There must be a pressure gradient be-
tween the intake manifold and the exhaust-
gas tract in order that exhaust gas can be
drawn in via the EGR valve. At part load
though, direct-injection engines are oper-
ated practically unthrottled. Furthermore 
a considerable amount of oxygen is drawn
into the intake manifold via EGR during
lean-burn operation. 

Non-throttled operation and the introduc-

tion of oxygen into the intake manifold via
the EGR therefore necessitate a control strat-
egy which coordinates throttle valve and EGR
valve. This results in severe demands being
made on the EGR system with regard to pre-
cision and reliability, and it must be robust
enough to withstand the deposits which ac-
cumulate in the exhaust-gas components as 
a result of the low exhaust-gas temperatures.

Gasoline injection systems over the years

Overview

Gasoline injection systems over the years

The primary purpose of the fuel-injection
system is to provide the engine with an
air/fuel mixture which is best suited to the
prevailing operating state. Over the years,
these systems have been continually im-
proved, a significant feature of this im-
provement being the constant increase in
the amount of electronic components used.

While the development objective in the
1970s lay primarily in increasing power 
and comfort, the emphasis switched from
the 1980s onwards to reducing emissions. 
A further requirement, which began to be
taken increasingly seriously, was the reduc-
tion of fuel consumption and with it also
the reduction of CO2 emissions.

Overview

Development of gasoline injection
 systems
An important milestone in the development
history of control systems for gasoline en-
gines was the introduction of electronically
controlled fuel-injection systems. Where
previously mechanically controlled fuel-in-
jection systems had been used, Bosch with
D-Jetronic introduced in 1967 for the first
time an electronic system in which fuel was
injected via electromagnetically actuated
fuel injectors intermittently onto the intake
valve of each cylinder (multi-point injec-
tion). 

However, wide-range use of fuel-injection

systems was only possible with lower-cost
designs. Mechanical K-Jetronic and Mono-
Jetronic with only one single, centrally situ-
ated electromagnetic fuel injector (single-
point injection) enabled fuel-injection
 technology to stretch also to mid-size 
and small cars. 

The carburetor was rendered completely

obsolete on account of the advantages of
gasoline injection with regard to fuel con-
sumption, power output, engine perfor-
mance and emission behavior. In particular,
the reduction of pollutant emissions could
only be achieved thanks to the advances
made in fuel-injection technology in con-
junction with exhaust-gas treatment (three-
way catalytic converter). The emission limits
laid down by legislators for hydrocarbons
(HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen
oxide (NOX) called for fuel-injection sys-
tems which were able to adjust the mixture
composition within very narrow limits.

Table 1 shows the development of Bosch

fuel-injection systems. Today, only the
Motronic engine-management system with
multi-point injection is still used. Only with
this type of fuel injection in conjunction
with complex engine management is it
 possible to comply with today’s stringent
emission limits.

The story of fuel injection

51

(cid:3)

The story of fuel injection

The story of fuel injection extends back to
 cover a period of almost one hundred years.
The Gasmotorenfabik Deutz was manufactur-
ing plunger pumps for injecting fuel in a
 limited production series as early as 1898.
A short time later the uses of the venturi-
 effect for carburetor design were discovered,
and fuel-injection systems based on the tech-
nology of the time ceased to be competitive.
Bosch started research on gasoline-injec-
tion pumps in 1912. The first aircraft engine
featuring Bosch fuel injection, a 1200-hp unit,
entered series production in 1937; problems
with carburetor icing and fire hazards had lent
special impetus to fuel-injection development
work for the aeronautics field. This develop-
ment marks the beginning of the era of fuel
 injection at Bosch, but there was still a long
path to travel on the way to fuel injection for
passenger cars.

1952 saw a Bosch direct-injection unit being
featured as standard equipment on a small car
for the first time. A unit was then installed in
the 300 SL, the legendary production sports
car from Daimler-Benz. In the years that fol-
lowed, development on mechanical injection
pumps continued, and ...

(cid:3) Bosch gasoline fuel injection from the year 1954

In 1967 fuel injection took another giant step
forward: The first electronic injection system:
the intake-pressure-controlled D-Jetronic!

In 1973 the air-flow-controlled L-Jetronic
 appeared on the market, at the same time as
the K-Jetronic, which featured mechanical-
 hydraulic control and was also an air-flow-
 controlled system. 

In 1976, the K-Jetronic was the first automo-

tive system to incorporate a Lambda closed-
loop control.

1979 marked the introduction of a new
 system: Motronic, featuring digital processing
for numerous engine functions. This system
combined L-Jetronic with electronic program-
map control for the ignition. The first automo-
tive microprocessor!

In 1982, the K-Jetronic model became
 available in an expanded configuration, the
KE-Jetronic, including an electronic closed-
loop control circuit and a Lambda oxygen
 sensor.

These were joined by Bosch Mono-Jetronic
in 1987: This particularly cost-efficient single-
point injection unit made it feasible to equip
small vehicles with Jetronic, and once and for
all made the carburetor absolutely super -
fluous.

Beginnings of mixture formation

Beginnings of mixture
 formation

At a time when the first atmospheric engines
were being designed by various inventors, a
common problem was forming an ignitable
mixture. The question of whether or not such
an internal-combustion engine would be able
to function at all. The solution was very much
dependent on the ignition mechanism. 

The basics of the carburetor were devel-
oped as early as the 18th Century. Inventors’
efforts at the time were directed at vaporizing
liquid fuels in such a way that they

could be used to operate a lighting or  heating
 device. 

In 1795 Robert Street was the first to
 suggest to vaporize turpentine or creosote 
in an atmospheric engine. Around 1825
Samuel Morey and Eskine Hazard developed
a two-cylinder engine for which they also 
designed the first carburetor. It was granted
British patent no. 5402. Up to that time, 
mixture-formation systems were essentially
fueled with turpentine or kerosene. 

However, this situation changed in 1833,

when Eilhardt Mitscherlich, professor of
chemistry at the University of Berlin, man-
aged to split benzoic acid by thermal crack-
ing. The result was the so-called “Faraday’s
olefiant gas”, which he called “benzene”, the
precursor of today’s gasoline. 

William Barnett designed the first carbure-

tor for gasoline. He was awarded patent no.
7615 in 1838. 

During this time, these designs were  either
wick carburetors (Fig. 1) or surface carbure-
tors (Fig. 2). The first carburetor to be used 
in a vehicle was a wick carburetor. The wick
drew up the fuel, similar to the oil-lamp prin-
ciple. The wick was then exposed to an air
stream in the engine, causing air and fuel to
blend. By contrast, in the surface carburetor,
in which the fuel was heated by the engine’s
exhaust gases, the result was a layer of vapor
just above the fuel surface. This was then
blended to form the required air-fuel mixture
by introducing an air stream. 

In Berlin in 1882 Siegfried Marcus applied
for a patent for the brush carburetor (Fig. 3)
that he had invented. This mixture generator
used the interaction of a rapidly rotating
cylindrical brush (3) driven by a drive pulley
(1) and a fuel stripper (2) to form a mist of
atomized fuel in the brush chamber (4). The
fuel mist was then drawn into the engine via
the inlet (5). The brush carburetor main-
tained its dominance for about 11 years.

In 1885 Nikolaus August Otto succeeded in

hydrocarbon fuels (alcohol/gasoline); he had
been working toward this goal since 1860.
The first gasoline-engine, working on the
four-stroke principle and equipped with a
surface carburetor and an electrical ignition
device of Otto’s own construction,  garnered

years (Fig. 4).

Benz Motor Carriage with surface carburetor 
(vertically positioned)

In the same year Carl Benz installed a sur-
face carburetor of his own design in his first
“Patent Motor Carriage” (Fig. 5). A short
while later, he improved the original design
of his carburetor by adding a valve float, as
he put it, “to always maintain the fuel level
automatically at the same height”.

In 1893 Wilhelm Maybach introduced his
jet-nozzle carburetor (Fig. 7). In this device,
the fuel was sprayed from a fuel nozzle onto
a baffle surface, which caused the fuel to dis-
tribute in a cone-shaped pattern (Fig. 8).

 further advancement to carburetor design. 
In these carburetors, which were to become
famous under the ZENITH brand name, 
the lean-fuel auxiliary or compensation jet
delivers a virtually unchanged air/fuel mix-
ture  despite increasing air velocity (Fig. 9). 
The same period also saw applications 
for the carburetor patents of Mennesson 
and Goudard. Their designs became world-
famous under the SOLEX brand (Fig. 10). 

The years that followed produced a
 proliferation of carburetor designs. In this
context, some of their names, e.g. SUM,
CUDELL, FAVORIT, ESCOMA, and
GRAETZIN, deserve special mention. 
After the Haak carburetor was patented 
in 1906 and manufactured by the firm of
PALLAS, Scüttler and Deutrich developed
the  PALLAS carburetor in 1912. It had a 
ring float and combination jet (Fig. 11). 

In 1914 the Royal Prussian War Ministry
sponsored a competition for benzol (ben-
zene) carburetors. Even at that time the test
specifications included the condition that
the exhaust gases should be as clean as pos-
sible. Of the competing products bearing
14 different brand names, it was a ZENITH
carburetor that won 1st prize. All the carbu-
retors were examined at the test facility of
the Technical University at Charlottenburg,
and subjected to a demanding 800-km win-
ter trial by the German army administration
in automobiles of identical horsepower.

was mounted on the crankcase between the
cylinder banks (not visible in Fig. 12). A pump
of this type is shown in Fig. 13. It has a total
length of about 70 cm (27.5 in.). 

In the late 1930s direct-injection systems
were used in conjunction with the 9-cylinder
radial BMW engines (Fig. 14) in the leg-
endary three-engine Junkers Ju 52 aircraft.
Especially noteworthy is the “boxer” 
(reciprocal) configuration of the 

13

12-cylinder in-line fuel-injection pump
(length approx. 70 cm)

The period that followed marked the begin-
ning of various attempts at detail work and
specialization. A variety of model configura-
tions and auxiliary devices was developed,
e.g. rotating slides and preliminary throttles
serving as start-assist measures, diaphragm
systems replacing the float in aircraft carbure-
tors, and pump systems providing accelera-
tion aids. The diversity of these modifications
was so extensive that any descriptive attempt
would exceed the scope of this chapter. 
In the 1920s, to obtain greater engine

power, single and twin carburetors (carbure-
tors featuring two throttle valves) were in-
stalled in the form of multiple carburetor sys-
tems (several single or twin carburetors with
synchonized controls). In the decades that
followed, the great variety of carburetor 
variants made by various manufacturers 
increased even further. 

In parallel with the ongoing carburetor de-
velopment for aircraft engines, the 1930s saw
the development of the first gasoline-injection
systems with direct injection (example in 
Fig. 12). This engine required two 12-cylinder
in-line fuel-injection pumps, each of which

In the 1950s this type of fuel-injection sys-

tem working with direct fuel injection also
made its debut in passenger cars. One example
was the “Gutbrod Superior” of 1952 (Fig. 16),
and the Goliath GP700E introduced in 1954
(Fig. 17). These two vehicles were compact
cars powered by two-cylinder, two-stroke en-
gines with a displacement of less than 1000 cc.
Their fuel-injection pumps were also compact
in size (Fig. 18). 

A component diagram of this two-cylinder
fuel-injection system, which entered the an-
nals of automotive history as the first gasoline
direct-injection system in passenger cars, 
appears in Figure 19 (next page).

However, the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL sports
car (Fig. 20) featured a Bosch-built gasoline
direct-injection system. It was presented to
the public on February 6, 1954 at the Interna-
tional Motor Sports Show in New York. In-
stalled at a 50-degree slant, the car’s 
6-cylinder in-line engine (M198/11) had 
a displacement of 2996 cc, and delivered 
215 HP (159 kW). 

A fundamentally different facet of air/fuel
 mixture formation for gasoline engines ap-
peared during the latter part of WWII and for
a while thereafter: the wood-gas generator. 
The wood gas emitted by the glowing
 charcoal was used to form an ignitable 
air/fuel mixture (Fig. 21). However, it was
hard to overlook the physical size of these
wood  gasifier systems (Fig. 22).

Due to the gradual tightening-up of emission
standards, the automotive industry has in-
creasingly shunned the carburetor. In the
early 1990s, however, there was a successful
design by Bosch and Pierburg that equipped a
modified conventional carburetor with mod-
ern-day actuators: the Ecotronic carburetor
(Fig. 23). This carburetor made it possible to
comply with the prevailing emission stan-
dards at the time, while at the same time 
ensuring economical fuel consumption.

At the conclusion of this
brief review of the history of
air/fuel mixture formation,
it should be stated that the
various carburetor types
continued to be used well
into the 1990s as standard
equipment in passenger
cars. In compact cars in par-
ticular, the carburetor en-
joyed sustained popularity 
due to its lower cost.

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

Evolution of gasoline
 injection systems

Since 1885, when the first manifold-injec-
tion system was used on a fixed industrial
engine, many changes have occurred in the
field of gasoline-injection systems. Later at-
tempts included a floatless carburetor with
attached fuel-injection device installed in
aircraft engines in 1925, and an electrically
triggered fuel-injection device in a racing
motorcycle in 1930. That was before Bosch
finally developed a mechanically driven
gasoline-injection pump for the Gutbrod
Superior 600 and Goliath GP 700 vehicles 
in 1951. These were the first passenger cars
with gasoline injection. The system was de-
signed as a direct-injection system. Even the
legendary Mercedes 300 SL was equipped
with gasoline direct injection featuring a
mechanical inline pump.

After passing though several development

stages of manifold-injection systems (de-
scribed below), the current trend is again
headed for direct-injection systems.

D-Jetronic system schematic 

D-Jetronic
System overview
The Bosch-engineered D-Jetronic comprises
a gasoline-injection system that is essentially
controlled by intake-manifold pressure and
engine speed. Hence the designation 
D-Jetronic (D stands for “drucksensorge -
steuert” – German for pressure-sensor-
 controlled).

The electronic control unit (Fig. 1, Pos. 1)

receives signals for intake-manifold pres-
sure, intake-air temperature, cooling-water
(coolant) and/or cylinder-head temperature,
throttle-valve position and movement, and
starting, engine speed, and start of injection.
The ECU processes these data, and sends
electrical pulses to the fuel injectors (2). The
ECU is interconnected with the electrical
components via a multiple connector and
wiring harness.

The fuel injectors spray the fuel into the
intake manifolds of the cylinders. The pres-
sure sensor (3) sends engine-load data to the
ECU. The temperature sensors communi-
cate the temperatures of air (13) and coolant
(4) to the ECU. The thermo-time switch (5)

switches the electric start valve (6), which
injects additional fuel into the intake mani-
fold during low-temperature starts. The
electric fuel pump (7) continuously delivers
fuel to the fuel injectors. The fuel filter (8) is
integrated in the fuel line to remove conta-
minants. The fuel-pressure regulator (9)
maintains a constant fuel pressure in the fuel
lines. The temperature-dependent function
of the auxiliary-air device (10) provides
 additional air during engine warm-up. 
The throttle-valve switch (11) sends engine
idle and full-load states to the ECU.

Method of operation
Pressure measurement
Upstream of the throttle valve inside the
 intake manifold, the pressure is equal to the
ambient atmospheric pressure. The pressure
downstream of the throttle valve is lower,
and changes with the throttle-valve position.
This reduced intake-manifold pressure
serves as the measured quantity for engine
load, which is the most important informa-
tion. Engine load is derived from the mea-
sure of the volume of air drawn into the
 engine. The information pertaining to the
pressure in the intake manifold is deter-
mined by the pressure sensor. 

The pressure sensor (Fig. 2) contains two
aneroid capsules which shift the armature of
a coil. The measuring system is pneumati-
cally connected via a line to the intake mani-
fold. As the load increases, i.e., as pressure in
the intake manifold increases, the aneroid
capsules are compressed and the armature is
drawn deeper into the coil. This changes its
inductance. The device is therefore a mea-
suring transducer that converts a pneumatic
pulse into an electrical signal. The induc-
tion-type pulse generator in the pressure
sensor is connected to an electronic timer in
the ECU. It determines the duration of the
electrical pulses required to trigger the fuel
injectors. In this way, the intake-manifold
pressure is directly converted to an injection
duration.

Fuel injection
Specific contacts in the ignition distributor
(injection trigger, Fig. 1, Pos. 12) determine
– in accordance with camshaft adjustment –
the beginning of the pulse for opening the
fuel injectors. Injection duration is mainly
dependent on engine load and engine speed.
Pressure sensor and injection trigger supply
the required signals to the ECU. This enables
the fuel injectors to inject fuel in metered
quantities by means of electrical pulses.

Adaptation to operating conditions
Adaptations under different operating con-
ditions are required to ensure good engine
performance:
(cid:2) Full load: The fuel quantity is determined

for maximum power 

(cid:2) Acceleration enrichment: Additional in-

jection pulses are applied during accelera-
tion

(cid:2) Altitude compensation: It is possible by

taking into account the pressure differen-
tial between intake manifold and free
 atmosphere to obtain good adaptation 
of fuel injection to different altitudes
(cid:2) Intake-air temperature: The temperature-
dependent density differences of the air
can be taken into account by recording
the outside temperature

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

K-Jetronic
System overview
K-Jetronic is a mechanically-hydraulically
controlled fuel-injection system which needs
no form of drive and which meters the fuel
as a function of the intake air quantity and
injects it continuously onto the engine in-
take valves. Hence the system designation 
K-Jetronic (Kontinuierlich = German for
 continuous).

Specific operating conditions of the en-
gine require corrective intervention in mix-
ture formation and this is carried out by 
K-Jetronic in order to optimize starting and
driving performance, power output and
 exhaust-gas composition. 

The K-Jetronic fuel-injection system

 covers the following functional areas:
(cid:2) Fuel supply
(cid:2) Air-flow measurement and 
(cid:2) Fuel metering

Mode of operation
An electrically driven roller-cell pump 
(Fig. 3, Pos. 2) pumps the fuel from the fuel
tank (1) at a pressure of over 5 bar to a fuel

K-Jetronic system schematic 

accumulator (3) and through a filter (4) to
the fuel distributor (9). The pressure regula-
tor integrated in the fuel distributor holds
the delivery pressure in the fuel system
 (system pressure) at about 5 bar.

From the fuel distributor, the fuel flows to

the fuel injectors (6). The fuel injectors in-
ject the fuel continuously into the engine’s
intake ports engine. When the intake valve is
opened, the air drawn in by the engine car-
ries the waiting “cloud” of fuel with it into
the cylinder. An ignitable air-fuel mixture is
formed during the induction stroke due to
the swirl effect.

The amount of air, corresponding to the
position of the throttle valve (16), drawn in
by the engine serves as the criterion for me-
tering of the fuel to the individual cylinders.
The amount of air drawn in by the engine is
measured by the air-flow sensor (10), which,
in turn, controls the fuel distributor. 

Injection occurs continuously, i.e., with-

out regard to the position of the intake
valve. When the intake valve is closed, the
mixture is stored.

Mixture enrichment is controlled in order to
adapt to various operating conditions such
as start, warm-up, idle and full load. In addi-
tion, supplementary functions such as over-
run fuel cutoff, engine-speed limitation and
lambda closed-loop control are possible.

Mixture-control unit
The task of the fuel-management system is
to meter a quantity of fuel corresponding to
the intake air quantity. Basically, fuel meter-
ing is carried out by the mixture-control
unit. This comprises the air-flow sensor and
the fuel distributor.

Air-flow sensor
The quantity of air drawn in by the engine is
a precise measure of its power. The air-flow
sensor (Fig. 4) installed ahead of the throttle
valve operates according to the suspended-
solid-particle principle and measures the
quantity of air drawn in by the engine. 
The intake air quantity serves as the main
control variable for determining the basic
injection quantity.

The air-flow sensor consists of an air fun-
nel (1), in which a moving sensor plate (2) is
located. The air flowing through the air fun-
nel deflects the sensor plate by a specific dis-
tance from its rest position. A lever system
(12) transmits the movements of the sensor
plate to a control plunger (8), which deter-

mines the basic injection quantity required
for basic functions. A counterweight com-
pensates for the weight of the sensor plate
and lever system (this is carried out by an
extension spring on the downdraft air-flow
sensor). A leaf spring (13) ensures the cor-
rect zero position in the switched-off phase.

Fuel distributor
Depending upon the position of the plate in
the air-flow sensor, the fuel distributor (10)
meters the basic injection quantity to the
 individual engine cylinders.

Depending upon its position in the barrel

with metering slits (9), the control plunger
opens or closes the slits to a greater or lesser
extent. The fuel flows through the open sec-
tion of the slits to the differential-pressure
valves and then to the fuel injectors.

If sensor-plate travel is only small, then

the control plunger is lifted only slightly
and, as a result, only a small section of the
slit is opened for the passage of fuel. In the
event of larger sensor-plate travel, the con-
trol plunger opens a larger section of the
slits and more fuel can flow. There is a linear
relationship between sensor-plate travel and
the slit section in the barrel which is opened
for fuel flow.

Differential-pressure valves
Differential-pressure valves (Fig. 5, next
page) in the fuel distributor result in a
 specific pressure drop at the metering slits. 
If the sensor-plate travel is to result in a
change of basic injection quantity in the
same proportion, then a constant drop in
pressure must be guaranteed at the metering
slits,  regardless of the amount of fuel flow-
ing through them. The differential-pressure
valves maintain the differential pressure be-
tween the upper chamber (5) and the lower
chamber (8) at a constant level, regardless of
fuel throughflow.

Flat-seat valves are used as differential-
pressure valves. They are fitted in the fuel
distributor and one such valve is allocated 
to each metering slit. A diaphragm separates
the upper and lower chambers of the valve.

Gasoline injection systems over the years

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

The control pressure is tapped from the
 primary system pressure through a throttle
bore. This throttle bore serves to isolate the
control-pressure circuit and the primary-
pressure circuit from one another. A connec-
tion line joins the fuel distributor and the
warm-up regulator (control-pressure regula-
tor). When the cold engine is started, the
control pressure is about 0.5 bar. As the en-
gine warms up, the warm-up regulator in-
creases the control pressure to about 3.7 bar.
The control pressure acts through a damp-

Fuel injector 

ing orifice on the control plunger and
thereby develops the force which opposes
the force of the air in the air-flow sensor. 
In doing so, the orifice dampens a possible
oscillation of the sensor plate which could
result due to pulsating air-intake flow. 

The level of the control pressure influences

fuel distribution. If the control pressure is
low, the air drawn in by the engine can deflect
the sensor plate further. This results in the
control plunger opening the metering slits
(11) further and the engine being allocated
more fuel. On the other hand, if the control
pressure is high, the air drawn in by the en-
gine cannot deflect the sensor plate so far
and, as a result, the engine receives less fuel.

Fuel injectors
The fuel injectors (Fig. 6) open at a given
pressure and inject the fuel metered to them
into the intake manifolds and onto the
cylinder intake valves. They open automati-
cally as soon as the opening pressure ex-
ceeds, for example, 3.5 bar. The valve needle
(3) vibrates at high frequency (chatter) as
the fuel is injected. When the engine is
switched off, the injectors close tightly when
the pressure in the fuel-supply system drops
below their opening pressure. This means
that no more fuel can enter the intake mani-
folds once the engine has stopped.

Adaptation to operating states
In addition to the basic functions described
up to now, the mixture has to be adapted in
particular operating states. These adapta-
tions (corrections) are necessary in order 
to optimize the power delivered, and to im-
prove exhaust-gas composition, starting
 behavior and performance.
(cid:2) Basic mixture adaptation: Basic adapta-
tion of the air/fuel mixture to the idle,
part-load and full-load operating condi-
tions is effected by shaping the air funnel
appropriately in the air-flow sensor. This
adaptation is achieved by designing the air
funnel so that it becomes wider in stages.

(cid:2) Overrun fuel cutoff: A solenoid valve

 actuated by a speed relay opens the air 
bypass to the sensor plate in overrun
mode at a specific engine speed. The sen-
sor plate then reverts to the zero position
and interrupts fuel metering.

Lambda closed-loop control
The lambda closed-loop control system 
(Fig. 7) required for operation of a three-
way catalytic converter necessitates the use
of an electronic control unit (2). The impor-
tant input variable for this ECU is the signal
supplied by the lambda oxygen sensor (1).
In order to adapt the injected fuel quan-
tity to the required air-fuel ratio at λ = 1, 
the pressure in the lower chambers (5) of
the fuel distributor (4) is varied. If, for in-
stance, the pressure in the lower chambers 
is reduced, the differential pressure at the
metering slits (6) increases, whereby the in-
jected fuel quantity is increased. In order to
permit the pressure in the lower chambers 
to be varied, these chambers, by comparison

(cid:2) Cold-start enrichment: As a function of
engine temperature, the cold-start valve
injects an additional quantity of fuel for 
a limited period during starting in order
to compensate for the fuel lost through
condensation from the inducted mixture.
The injection period of the cold-start
valve is limited by a thermo-time switch
depending on the engine temperature.
This consists of an electrically heated
bimetal strip which, depending on its
temperature, opens or closes a contact.
(cid:2) Warm-up enrichment: Mixture control 
for warm-up operation is effected via the
control pressure by the warm-up regulator
(control-pressure regulator). When the
 engine is cold, the warm-up regulator re-
duces the control pressure to a degree de-
pendent on engine temperature and thus
causes the metering slits to open  further.
(cid:2) Idle stabilization: As it warms up, the en-
gine receives more air via the auxiliary-air
device. Due to the fact that this auxiliary
air is measured by the air-flow sensor and
taken into account for fuel metering, the
engine is provided with more air-fuel
mixture. This results in idle stabilization
when the engine is cold.

(cid:2) Full-load enrichment: Engines operated in
the part-load range with a very lean mix-
ture require enrichment during full-load
operation in addition to mixture  correction
resulting from the shape of the air funnel.
This extra enrichment is performed by 
a specially designed warm-up regulator,
which regulates the control pressure as a
function of the intake- manifold pressure.
(cid:2) Transition response during acceleration: If,
at constant engine speed, the throttle valve
is quickly opened, the amount of air which
enters the combustion chambers plus the
amount of air which is needed to bring the
manifold pressure up to the new level flows
through the air-flow sensor. This causes the
sensor plate to briefly “overswing” past the
fully opened throttle point. This “over-
swing” results in more fuel being metered
to the engine (acceleration enrichment)
and ensures good transition response.

with the standard K-Jetronic fuel distribu-
tor, are isolated from the primary pressure
via a fixed restrictor (7).

A further restrictor (3) connects the lower
chambers and the fuel return. This restrictor
is variable: If it is open, the pressure in the
lower chambers can drop. If it is closed, the
primary pressure builds up in the lower
chambers. If this restrictor is opened and
closed in a fast rhythmic succession, the
pressure in the lower chambers can be var-
ied dependent on the ratio of closing time 
to opening time. An electromagnetic valve,
the timing valve, is used as the variable re-
strictor. It is controlled by electrical pulses
from the lambda controller.

KE-Jetronic
The system design of KE-Jetronic is essen-
tially identical to that of K-Jetronic. The
 distinguishing difference is the electronic
mixture control, which in this system is
 performed by means of an electrohydraulic
pressure actuator (Fig. 8). This pressure ac-
tuator is mounted on the fuel distributor.
The actuator is a differential-pressure con-
troller which functions according to the
nozzle/baffle-plate principle, and its pressure
drop is controlled by the current input from
the ECU.

L-Jetronic
System overview
L-Jetronic (Fig. 9) is an electronically con-
trolled fuel-injection system which injects
fuel intermittently into the intake manifolds.
It does not require any form of drive.

The electric fuel pump (2) supplies the
fuel to the engine and generates the pressure
necessary for injection. Fuel injectors (5) in-
ject the fuel into the individual intake mani-
folds. An electronic control unit (4) controls
the fuel injectors. The ECU evaluates the sig-
nals delivered by the sensors and generates
the appropriate control pulses for the fuel
injectors. The amount of fuel to be injected
is defined by the opening time of the fuel
 injectors.

Acquisition of operating data
Sensors detect the operating mode of the
 engine and communicate this in the form 
of electrical signals to the ECU. The main
measured variables are the engine speed and
the amount of air drawn in by the engine.
These variables determine the basic injec-
tion period. The engine speed is either de-
tected by the breaker point in the ignition
distributor (in breaker-triggered ignition
systems) or communicated by terminal 1 of
the ignition coil to the ECU (in breakerless
ignition systems).

The sensor plate in the air-flow sensor
measures the total amount of air inducted
by the engine. The measurement allows for
all changes which may take place in the en-
gine during the service life of the vehicle,
e.g.
(cid:2) Wear
(cid:2) Deposits in the combustion chamber, and
(cid:2) Changes in valve adjustment

Fuel metering
As the central unit of the system, the ECU
evaluates the data delivered by the sensors
pertaining to the engine operating state. 
The ECU uses these data to generate 
control pulses for fuel metering by the fuel
injectors, whereby the quantity to be in-
jected is determined by the length of time

The air/fuel ratio can be maintained at 
λ = 1 by means of lambda closed-loop con-
trol. The ECU compares the lambda-sensor
signal with an ideal value (setpoint) and
thereby activates a two-state controller.

The L-Jetronic output stage activates three

or four fuel injectors in parallel. ECUs for
six- and eight-cylinder engines have two
output stages for three or four injectors
each. Both output stages operate in unison.
The injection cycle is selected so that for
each revolution of the camshaft half the
amount of fuel required by each working
cylinder is injected twice.

Adaptation to operating states
In addition to the basic functions, the mix-
ture has to be adapted during particular
 operating states. These adaptations (correc-
tions) are necessary in order to improve the
power delivered by the engine, the exhaust-
gas composition, starting behavior, and per-
formance. With additional sensors for the
engine temperature and the throttle-valve

position (load signal), the L-Jetronic ECU
can perform these adaptation tasks. The
characteristic curve of the air-flow sensor
determines the fuel-requirement curve,
 specific to the particular engine, for all
 operating ranges.

The following adaptations are possible

with L-Jetronic:
(cid:2) Cold-start enrichment: As a function of
engine temperature, an additional quan-
tity of fuel is injected for a limited period
during starting. Enrichment is achieved
by extending the injection period or by
injecting an additional quantity of fuel via
the cold-start valve. The injection period
of the cold-start valve is limited by a
thermo-time switch depending on the
 engine temperature.

(cid:2) Post-start and warm-up enrichment:
 Engine cold starting is followed by its
warming-up phase. During this phase, 
the engine needs warm-up enrichment
since some of the fuel condenses on the
still cold cylinder walls. In addition, with-
out supplementary fuel enrichment dur-
ing the warm-up period, a major drop in

Gasoline injection systems over the years

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

L3-Jetronic
Specific systems have been developed from
L-Jetronic. The most recent stage of devel-
opment is L3-Jetronic, which differs from 
L-Jetronic in respect of the following details:
(cid:2) The ECU is attached to the air-flow sensor
and therefore no longer requires space in
the passenger compartment

(cid:2) The use of digital technology permits new
functions with improved adaptation capa-
bilities to be implemented as compared
with the previous analog technology used

L3-Jetronic is available both with and
 without lambda closed-loop control. Both
versions have what is called a “limp-home”
function, which enables the driver to drive
the vehicle to the nearest garage/workshop 
if the microcomputer fails.

By contrast with L-Jetronic, the ECU 
of this system adapts the air/fuel ratio by
means of a load/engine-speed map. On the
basis of the input signals from the sensors,
the ECU computes the injection duration 
as a measure of the amount of fuel to be
 injected. It permits the required functions 
to be influenced.

L3-Jetronic performs corrective interven-

tions in mixture formation with compo-
nents such as the throttle-valve switch, aux-
iliary-air device, engine-temperature sensor,
and lambda closed-loop control.

engine speed would be noticed after the
additional fuel from the cold-start valve
has been cut off. When post-start enrich-
ment has finished, the engine needs only 
a slight mixture enrichment, this being
controlled by the engine temperature.
(cid:2) Acceleration enrichment: If the throttle
valve is quickly opened (acceleration), 
the amount of air which enters the com-
bustion chambers plus the amount of air
which is needed to bring the manifold
pressure up to the new level flows through
the air-flow sensor. This causes the sensor
plate to “overswing” past the wide-open-
throttle point. This “overswing” results 
in more fuel being metered to the engine
and ensures good transition response.
Since this acceleration enrichment is not
sufficient during the warming-up phase,
the ECU also evaluates an electrical signal
representing the speed at which the sensor
plate is deflected in this operating state.
(cid:2) Idle-speed control: The air-flow sensor

contains an adjustable bypass via which a
small quantity of air can bypass the sensor
plate. The idle-mixture-adjusting screw
permits a basic setting of the air/fuel ratio
by varying the bypass cross-section. An
auxiliary-air device, which is connected as
a bypass to the throttle valve, directs aux-
iliary air to the engine, depending on the
engine temperature, in order to achieve
smooth idling when the engine is cold.
(cid:2) Air-temperature adaptation: The air mass
crucial to combustion is dependent on the
temperature of the inducted air. The in-
take port of the air-flow sensor incorpo-
rates a temperature sensor so that this
 influence can be taken into account.

dependent resistors. A voltage signal which
is proportional to the air-mass flow is trans-
mitted to the ECU.

Hot-film air-mass meter
In the case of the hot-film air-mass meter
(Fig. 11), the electrically heated element is 
in the form of a platinum film resistor
(heater element). The temperature of the
heater element is registered by a tempera-
ture-dependent resistor (flow sensor). 
The voltage across the heater element is a
measure for the air-mass flow. It is converted
by the hot-film air-mass meter’s electronic
circuitry into a voltage which is suitable for
the ECU.

LH-Jetronic
LH-Jetronic is closely related to L-Jetronic.
The difference lies in air-mass metering. The
result of measurement is thus independent
of the air density, which is itself dependent
on temperature and pressure.

Air-mass meters
The hot-wire air-mass meter (HLM) and the
hot-film air-mass meter (HFM) are thermal
load sensors. They are installed between the
air filter and the throttle valve and register
the air-mass flow drawn in by the engine
(kg/h). Both sensors operate according to
the same principle.

Hot-wire air-mass meter
In the case of the hot-wire air-mass meter
(Fig. 10), the electrically heated element is 
in the form of a 70 μm thick platinum wire.
The intake-air temperature is registered by 
a temperature sensor. The hot wire and the
intake-air temperature sensor are part of a
bridge circuit and function as temperature-

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

Mono-Jetronic
System overview
Mono-Jetronic (Fig. 12) is an electronically
controlled low-pressure central injection
system for four-cylinder engines with a cen-
trally situated electromagnetic fuel injector
(single-point injection) – in contrast to one
fuel injector for each cylinder in the multi-
point injection systems K-, KE-, L-, L3- and
LH-Jetronic. The heart of Mono-Jetronic is
the central injection unit with an electro-
magnetic fuel injector for intermittent fuel
injection above the throttle valve.

The intake manifold distributes the fuel 
to the individual cylinders. A variety of dif-
ferent sensors are used to determine all the
engine’s operating parameters which are
 required for optimum mixture adaptation. 

Input variables are, for example:
(cid:2) Throttle-valve angle
(cid:2) Engine speed
(cid:2) Engine and intake-air temperatures
(cid:2)  Throttle-valve positions (idle/full load)
(cid:2) Residual-oxygen content in the exhaust

gas

(cid:2) Automatic-transmission setting (depend-

ing on the vehicle equipment specification)

(cid:2) Air-conditioner settings, and
(cid:2) A/C-compressor switch setting.

Input circuits in the ECU condition these
data for the microprocessor. The micro-
processor processes the operating data, iden-
tifies the engine’s operating state from these
data, and calculates actuating signals depend-
ing on the data. Output stages amplify the
signals and actuate the fuel injector, throttle-
valve actuator and canister-purge valve
 (evaporative-emissions control system).

rectly by a combination of the two variables
throttle-valve angle α and engine speed n.

The lower section of the central injection

unit comprises the throttle valve (3) to-
gether with the throttle-valve potentiometer.
The upper section accommodates the fuel
system with the fuel injector (1), the pres-
sure regulator (4) and the fuel passages 
(5, 6). In addition, the air-temperature sen-
sor (2) is located on the upper-section cap.

The fuel flows to the injector via the lower

passage (6). The upper passage (5) is con-
nected to the lower chamber of the pressure
regulator, from which point excess fuel en-
ters the fuel-return line via the plate valve.
A shoulder on the fuel-injector strainer
limits the open cross-section between the in-
let and return passages to a defined dimen-
sion in such a way that the excess, uninjected
fuel is split into two partial flows. One flow
passes through the fuel injector, while the
other flows around the fuel injector for cool-
ing purposes. 

A typical Mono-Jetronic design is broken
down into the following functional areas:
(cid:2) Fuel supply
(cid:2) Acquisition of operating data, and
(cid:2) Processing of operating data

Mono-Jetronic’s essential function is to
 control the fuel-injection process. Mono-
Jetronic also incorporates a number of
 supplementary closed-loop and open-loop
control functions with which it monitors
components that influence exhaust-gas
composition. These include:
(cid:2) Idle-speed control
(cid:2) Lambda closed-loop control, and
(cid:2) Open-loop control of the evaporative-

emissions control system

Central injection unit
The central injection unit (Fig. 13) is bolted
directly to the intake manifold. It supplies
the engine with finely atomized fuel, and 
is the heart of the Mono-Jetronic system. 
Its design is dictated by the fact that, in con-
trast to multi-point injection systems (e.g.,
L-Jetronic), gasoline injection takes place 
at a central point and the quantity of air
 inducted by the engine is determined indi-

Gasoline injection systems over the years

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

Fuel injector
One of Mono-Jetronic’s most important
functions is to distribute the air/fuel mixture
uniformly to all the cylinders. Apart from
intake-manifold design, distribution de-
pends mainly on the fuel injector’s location
and position, and on the quality of its 
air-fuel mixture preparation.

The fuel injector is installed in the hous-
ing of the central injection unit’s upper sec-
tion, which is centered in the intake-air flow
by a bracket. This installation position above
the throttle valve ensures that the injected
fuel is mixed thoroughly with the air that
flows past. To this end, the fuel is finely 
atomized and injected in a cone-shaped 
jet  between the throttle valve and the 
throttle-valve housing.

The fuel injector (Fig. 14) comprises the
valve housing and the valve group. The valve
housing contains the solenoid winding (4)
and the electrical connection (1). The valve
group includes the valve body, which holds
the valve needle (6) and its solenoid arma-
ture (5). When no voltage is applied to the
solenoid winding, a helical spring assisted by
the primary system pressure forces the valve
needle onto its seat. When the winding is
 energized, the needle lifts about 0.06 mm
(depending on valve design) from its seat 

so that fuel can exit through an annular gap.
The front end of the valve needle incorpo-
rates a pintle (7), which projects out of the
valve-body bore; the shape of this pintle
 atomizes the fuel.

The size of the gap between the pintle and
the valve body determines the static injector
quantity, i.e.,  the maximum fuel through-
flow when the injector is permanently open.
The dynamic quantity injected during inter-
mittent operation is also dependent on the
valve spring, the mass of the valve needle,
the magnetic circuit, and the ECU output
stage. Because the fuel pressure is constant,
the amount of fuel actually injected by the
fuel injector depends solely on the valve’s
opening time (injection duration).

The fuel injector’s pickup and dropout
times vary according to battery voltage. 
The battery voltage is therefore measured
continuously by the ECU and used to cor-
rect the injection duration.

Throttle-valve actuator
Through its actuator shaft (Fig. 15, Pos. 4), the
throttle-valve actuator (Fig. 15) can adjust the
throttle-valve lever and thereby influence the
amount of air made available to the engine. In
this way, the idle speed can be regulated when
the accelerator pedal is not pressed (idle).

The throttle-valve actuator is powered by 
a DC motor (1), which drives the actuator
shaft through a worm (2) and a worm gear
(3). Depending upon the motor’s direction
of rotation (which in turn depends upon the
polarity applied to it), the actuator shaft ei-
ther extends and opens the throttle valve or
retracts and reduces the throttle-valve angle.
The actuator shaft incorporates a switch-

ing contact, which closes when the shaft
abuts against the throttle-valve lever and
thus signals the idle operating state to the
ECU.

Fuel-pressure regulator
The fuel-pressure regulator keeps constant
at 100 kPa the difference between fuel and
ambient pressures at the fuel-injector meter-
ing point. It is integrated in the hydraulic
section of the central injection unit. A 
rubber-fabric diaphragm divides the fuel-
 pressure regulator into a fuel-pressurized
lower chamber (Fig. 16, Pos. 6) and an upper
chamber (5), in which a preloaded helical
spring (4) is supported on the diaphragm. 
A movable valve plate, which is connected 
to the diaphragm through the valve holder,
is pressed onto the valve seat by spring force
(flat-seat valve). When the force resulting
from the fuel pressure and the diaphragm

16

surface exceeds the opposing spring force,
the valve plate is lifted off its seat slightly.
This allows fuel to flow back through the
opened cross-section to the fuel tank. In this
state of equilibrium, the differential pressure
between the upper and lower chambers of
the pressure regulator is 100 kPa. Venting
ports maintain the spring chamber’s ambi-
ent pressure at levels corresponding to those
at the injector nozzle. The valve-plate lift
varies depending on the delivery quantity
and the actual fuel quantity required.

Because of the constant fuel pressure
compared with the ambient pressure at the
point of injection, the injected fuel quantity
is determined solely by the length of time
(injection duration) the injector remains
open for each triggering pulse.

Acquisition of operating data
Sensors monitor all essential operating 
data to furnish instantaneous information
on current engine operating conditions.
This information is transmitted to the 
ECU in the form of electrical signals, which
are then converted into digital form and
processed for use in actuating the various
actuators or final controlling elements.

Throttle-valve angle
The air charge, which is crucial to calculat-
ing the injection duration, is determined
 indirectly by combining the two variables
throttle-valve angle α and engine speed n
(α/n-system). Here, the throttle-valve 
potentiometer in the central injection unit
records the throttle-valve angle α. 

The engine map range in which the air
charge varies the most as a function of α is
encountered with small throttle-valve angles
α and at low engine speeds n, i.e., at idle and
at low part load. It follows from this that a
high angle resolution is required in these
 operating states.

Gasoline injection systems over the years

Evolution of gasoline injection systems

The required high level of signal resolution
is achieved by distributing the throttle-valve
angle in the throttle-valve potentiometer for
the range between idle and full load between
two resistance paths (0°...24° and 18°...90°).
In the ECU, the angle signals α are read in
separately, each via its own analog-digital
converter channel.

Engine speed
The engine-speed information required for
α/n control is obtained by monitoring the
periodicity of the ignition signal. The signals
provided by the ignition system are pro -
cessed in the ECU. At the same time, these
signals are also used for triggering the injec-
tion pulses, whereby each ignition pulse
triggers an injection pulse.

Further operating states
In addition, Mono-Jetronic records the 
following information:
(cid:2) Engine temperature in order to be able 
to take into account the increased fuel
 demand when the engine is cold.

(cid:2) Intake-air temperature for compensating
the temperature-dependent air density.
(cid:2) Idle position for activating overrun fuel

cutoff; this information is supplied by the
idle contact on the throttle-valve actuator. 

(cid:2) Full load for activating full-load enrich-

ment; this information is derived from the
throttle-valve signal.

(cid:2) Battery voltage in order to be able to com-
pensate the voltage-dependent pickup
time of the electromagnetic fuel injector
and the voltage-dependent delivery rate 
of the electric fuel pump.

(cid:2) Switching signals of the air conditioner
and automatic transmission in order to 
be able to adapt the idle speed to the in-
creased power demand.

Processing of operating data
The ECU generates from the data supplied
by the sensors the triggering signals for the
fuel injector, the throttle-valve actuator and
the canister-purge valve.

Lambda program map
In order to ensure a desired air/fuel ratio, it
is necessary to select the injection duration
so that it is proportional to the recorded air
charge. In other words: The injection dura-
tion can be directly allocated to α and n.
This allocation is effected by means of a
lambda program map (Fig. 17) with the
 input variables α and n. The influence of 
the air density is fully compensated here.
The intake-air temperature is measured 
as the air enters the central injection unit
and is taken into account in the ECU with 
a correction factor.

Mixture adaptation
When the engine is started cold, effective
fuel vaporization is inhibited by the follow-
ing factors:
(cid:2) Cold intake air
(cid:2) Cold manifold walls
(cid:2) High manifold pressure
(cid:2) Low air-flow velocity in the intake mani-

(cid:2) Cold combustion chambers and cylinder

fold, and

walls

These conditions call for mixture adaptation
in the starting phase and in the post-start
and warming-up phases.

Lambda closed-loop control
Mono-Jetronic is equipped with a lambda
closed-loop control function, designed to
maintain the air/fuel ratio for the three-way
catalytic converter at λ = 1. Adaptive mix-
ture corrections are also performed, i.e., 
the self-learning system adapts itself to the
changing conditions.

With this adaptive mixture control and
the additionally superimposed lambda con-
trol loop, indirect recording of the inducted
air mass by means of α/n control facilitates
constancy of mixture. Air-mass metering no
longer needs to be performed here.

Likewise, various corrections are made to
the mixture composition when the engine 
is hot:
(cid:2) Intake-air-dependent mixture correction
(cid:2) Transient compensation in the case of

load changes which are triggered by throt-
tle-valve movements: The injected fuel
quantity must be increased in the event 
of rapid acceleration/opening up of the
throttle (buildup of wall-applied fuel film
in the intake manifold) and conversely
 reduced in the event of rapid decelera-
tion/closing of the throttle (reduction 
of wall-applied fuel film again).

(cid:2) Lambda closed-loop control
(cid:2) Mixture adaptation which takes into ac-
count influences on account of tolerances
or changes made to the engine and fuel-
injection components over the course of
time.

Further Mono-Jetronic functions are: 
(cid:2) Idle-speed control, which guarantees a

constant engine speed at idle over the en-
tire service life of the vehicle. The engine
speed is maintained under all conditions
(e.g. vehicle electrical system subjected to
load, switched-on air conditioner).
(cid:2) Altitude compensation, which compen-
sates for lower intake-air density at high
altitudes.

(cid:2) Full-load enrichment so that maximum
engine power can be delivered when the
accelerator pedal is pressed to the floor.
(cid:2) Engine-speed limitation in order to pre-
vent the engine from incurring damage
caused by excessive engine speeds.
(cid:2) Overrun fuel cutoff so that exhaust-gas

emissions are reduced when driving with
the throttle valve closed (vehicle on over-
run).

Fuel supply

Fuel delivery with manifold injection

Fuel supply

The function of the fuel-supply system is to
deliver fuel at a defined pressure to the fuel
injectors. The fuel injectors inject the fuel
into the intake manifold (manifold injec-
tion) or directly into the combustion cham-
ber (gasoline direct injection). In the case 
of manifold injection, an electric fuel pump
delivers the fuel from the tank to the fuel
 injectors. In the case of gasoline direct in-
jection, the fuel is likewise delivered from
the tank by means of an electric fuel pump;
then it is compressed to a higher pressure
by a high-pressure pump and supplied to
the high-pressure injectors. 

Fuel delivery with manifold
injection

An electric fuel pump delivers the fuel and
generates the injection pressure, which 
for manifold injection is typically about
0.3...0.4 MPa (3...4 bar). The built-up fuel
pressure to a large extent prevents vapor
bubbles from forming in the fuel system. 
A non-return valve integrated in the pump
stops fuel from flowing back through the
pump to the fuel tank and thereby main-
tains the system pressure for a certain
amount of time, even after the electric fuel
pump has been switched off. This prevents

the formation of vapor bubbles in the fuel
system when the fuel heats up after the en-
gine has been switched off.

System with fuel return 
The fuel is drawn from the fuel tank (Fig. 1,
Pos. 1) and passes through the fuel filter into
a high-pressure line, from where it flows to
the engine-mounted fuel rail (7). The rail
supplies the fuel to the fuel injectors (6). A
mechanical pressure regulator (5) mounted
on the rail keeps the differential pressure be-
tween the fuel injectors and the intake mani-
fold constant, regardless of the absolute in-
take-manifold pressure, i.e., the engine load. 
The fuel not needed by the engine flows
through the rail via a return line (8) con-
nected to the pressure regulator back to 
the fuel tank. The excess fuel heated in the
engine compartment causes the fuel temper-
ature in the tank to rise. Fuel vapors are
formed in the tank as a function of fuel tem-
perature. Ensuring adherence to environ-
mental-protection regulations, the vapors
are routed through a tank-ventilation system
for intermediate storage in a carbon canister
until they can be returned through the in-
take manifold for combustion in the engine
(evaporative-emissions control system).

Returnless system
In a returnless fuel-supply system (Fig. 2),
the pressure regulator (3) is located in the
fuel tank or in its immediate vicinity. A re-
turn line from the engine to the fuel tank is
therefore rendered superfluous. 

Since the pressure regulator on account 
of its installation location has no reference
to the intake-manifold pressure, the relative
injection pressure here is not dependent on
the engine load. This is taken into account 
in the calculation of the injection duration
in the engine ECU.

Only the amount of fuel which is to be in-
jected is delivered to the rail (5). The excess
flow volume delivered by the electric fuel
pump (2) returns directly to the fuel tank
without taking the circuitous route through
the engine compartment. In this way, fuel
heating in the fuel tank and thus also evapo-
rative emissions are significantly lower than
in systems with fuel return. 

Because of these advantages, it is return-
less systems which are predominantly used
today.

Demand-controlled system
In a demand-controlled system (Fig. 3), the
fuel-supply pump delivers only that amount
of fuel that is currently used by the engine
and that is required to set up the desired
pressure. Pressure control is effected by
means of a closed control loop in the engine
ECU, whereby the current fuel pressure is
recorded by a low-pressure sensor. A me-
chanical pressure regulator is rendered su-
perfluous. To adjust the delivery volume of
the fuel-supply pump, its operating voltage
is altered by means of a clock module that is
triggered by the engine ECU. 

The system is equipped with a pressure-

relief valve (3) to prevent the buildup of
 excessive pressure even during overrun fuel
cutoff or after the engine has been switched
off. 

As a result of demand control, no excess fuel
is compressed and thus the capacity of the
electric fuel pump minimized. Compared
with systems with maximum-delivery elec-
tric fuel pumps, this lowers fuel consump-
tion and can also reduce still further the 
fuel temperatures in the tank. 

Further advantages of a demand-con-
trolled system are derived from the variably
adjustable fuel pressure. On the one hand,
the pressure can be increased during hot
starting to prevent the formation of vapor
bubbles. On the other hand, it is possible
above all in turbocharging applications to
extend the metering range of the fuel injec-
tors by effecting a pressure increase at full
load and a pressure decrease at very low
loads. 

Furthermore, the measured fuel pressure

provides for improved diagnostic options
for the fuel system compared with previous
systems. In addition, the fact that the cur-
rent fuel pressure is taken into account in
the calculation of the injection duration
 results in higher-precision fuel metering.

(cid:2) Pressure-limiting valve

Where both continuous-delivery and
 demand-controlled high-pressure systems
are used in 1st-generation gasoline direct
 injection, 2nd-generation systems are
 demand-controlled. 

Depending on the operating point, a system
pressure of between 5 and 12 MPa and in
2nd-generation systems of up to 20 MPa 
is set by means of high-pressure control in
the engine ECU. The high-pressure injectors
injecting the fuel directly into the engine’s
combustion chamber are mounted on the
fuel rail. 

Fuel delivery with gasoline
direct injection

Compared with injecting fuel into the intake
manifold, there is only a limited time win-
dow available for injecting fuel directly into
the combustion chamber. Increased impor-
tance is also attached to mixture prepara-
tion. For this reason, fuel must be injected 
at significantly higher pressure with direct
injection than with manifold injection. 

The fuel system is divided into: 
(cid:2) Low-pressure circuit, and
(cid:2) High-pressure circuit

4

1

Low-pressure circuit
Low-pressure circuits for gasoline direct in-
jection essentially use the fuel systems and
components known in manifold-injection
systems. Due to the fact that currently used
high-pressure pumps require
increased predelivery pressure
(admission pressure) in order
to prevent vapor-bubble for-
mation during hot starts and
high-temperature operation, it
is advantageous to use systems
with variable low pressure.
 Demand-controlled low-pres-
sure systems are particularly
well suited here in that the
 optimum admission pressure
in each case can be set for 
every engine operating state.
However, other systems are
used. They may be returnless
systems with selectable admis-
sion pressure (controlled by
means of a shutoff valve) or
systems featuring a constant,
high admission pressure.

via the pressure-limiting valve to the low-
pressure circuit.

Evaporative-emissions
 control system

Vehicles with gasoline engines are equipped
with an evaporative-emissions control sys-
tem to prevent fuel that evaporates from 
the fuel tank from escaping to atmosphere. 
The maximum permissible limits for evapo-
rative hydrocarbon emissions are laid down
in emission-control legislation. 

Design and method of operation 
Fuel vapor is routed via a vent line (Fig. 3,
Pos. 2) from the fuel tank (1) to the carbon
canister (3). The activated carbon absorbs
the fuel contained in the fuel vapor and
 allows the air to escape to atmosphere
through the fresh-air inlet opening (4). 
In order to ensure that the carbon canister 
is always able to absorb freshly evaporating
fuel, the activated carbon must be regener-
ated at regular intervals. The carbon canister
is connected to the intake manifold (8) via 
a canister-purge valve (5) for this purpose. 

3

Evaporative-emissions control system

Continuous-delivery system
A high-pressure pump (Fig. 1, Pos. 4) driven
by the engine camshaft, normally a three-
barrel radial-piston pump, forces fuel into
the rail against the system pressure. The
pump’s delivery quantity is not adjustable.
The excess fuel not required for fuel injec-
tion or to maintain the pressure is depres-
surized by the pressure-control valve (7) and
returned to the low-pressure circuit. For this
purpose, the pressure-control valve is actu-
ated by the engine ECU in such a way as to
obtain the injection pressure required at a
given operating point. The pressure-control
valve doubles up as a mechanical pressure-
limiting valve.

In continuous-delivery systems, most 
of the operating points cause significantly
more fuel to be compressed to high system
pressure than is needed by the engine. This
involves an unnecessary expenditure of en-
ergy and with it increased fuel consumption;
furthermore, the excess fuel depressurized
by the pressure-control valve contributes 
to increasing the temperature in the fuel
 system. To avoid this problem, demand-
 controlled high-pressure systems are now
preferred.

Demand-controlled system
In a demand-controlled system, the high-
pressure pump – usually a single-barrel
 radial-piston pump – delivers to the fuel 
rail only that amount of fuel which is actu-
ally needed for injection and to maintain the
pressure (Fig. 2). The pump (6) is driven by
the engine camshaft. The delivery quantity 
is adjusted by a fuel-supply control valve:
The engine ECU actuates the pump’s fuel-
supply control valve in such a way as to
 obtain in the rail the necessary system
 pressure for a given operating point. 

For safety reasons, the high-pressure cir-
cuit features an integrated mechanical pres-
sure-limiting valve; this valve is mounted on
the fuel rail (8) in the case of 1st-generation
gasoline direct injection, and integrated di-
rectly in the high-pressure pump in the case
of the 2nd generation. Should the pressure

Fuel supply

Evaporative-emissions control system, electric fuel pump

To regenerate, the canister-purge valve is
 actuated by the engine-management system
and opens the line connecting the canister 
to the intake manifold. Fresh air (4) is drawn
in through the activated carbon as a result of
the vacuum pressure in the intake manifold.
The fresh air takes up the absorbed fuel
from the carbon canister and carries it to the
intake manifold. From there, it passes with
the air inducted by the engine into the com-
bustion chamber. The injected fuel quantity
is simultaneously reduced so that the correct
fuel quantity is available. The fuel quantity
drawn in through the carbon canister is cal-
culated by means of the measured excess-air
factor λ and regulated to a setpoint value. 

The purge-gas quantity, i.e. the air/fuel mix-
ture that flows in through the canister-purge
valve, is limited due to possible fluctuations
of the fuel concentration; this is because 
the greater the proportion of fuel supplied
through the valve, the quicker and more
 intensively the system will have to correct
the injected fuel quantity. This correction 
is effected by means of lambda closed-loop
control, whereby fluctuations of concentra-
tion are necessarily compensated for with a
time delay. In order not to impair exhaust-
gas values and driveability, it is essential for
fluctuations of the lambda value to be kept
to a minimum by limiting the purge-gas
quantity. 

Gasoline direction injection: special features
The effect of purging is limited in systems
with gasoline direct injection in stratified-
charge mode since the extensive dethrottling
gives rise to a low intake-manifold vacuum.
This results in reduced purge-gas flow com-
pared to homogeneous operation. For in-
stance, if the purge-gas flow is inadequate
for coping with high levels of gasoline 
evaporation, the engine must be operated 
in  homogeneous mode until the high con-
centrations of gasoline in the purge-gas flow
have dropped far enough. 

Fuel-vapor generation
Increased evaporation of fuel from the fuel
tank is caused when
(cid:2) The fuel in the fuel tank is heated up on
account of increased ambient tempera-
ture, by adjoining hot components 
(e.g., exhaust system) or by the return 
of heated fuel to the fuel tank 

(cid:2) The ambient pressure drops, e.g. when
driving up a hill in mountain environ-
ments

Electric fuel pump

Function
The electric fuel pump must in all operating
states deliver enough fuel to the engine at a
high enough pressure to permit efficient fuel
injection. The most important performance
demands made on the pump are:
(cid:2) Delivery quantity between 60 and 250 l/h

at nominal voltage

(cid:2) Pressure in the fuel system between 300

and 650 kPa (3.0...6.5 bar)

(cid:2) Buildup of system pressure from 50...60 %
of nominal voltage; the decisive factor
here is operation during cold starting

Apart from this, the electric fuel pump is
 increasingly being used as the pre-supply
pump for modern direct-injection systems
used on both gasoline and diesel engines. 
In the case of gasoline direct injection,
sometimes pressures of up to 700 kPa must
be provided during hot-delivery operation.

Design 
The electric fuel pump comprises:
(cid:2) Fitting cover (Fig. 1, A) with electrical

connections, non-return valve (preventing
fuel from escaping from the fuel system)
and hydraulic outlet. The fitting cover
usually also contains the carbon brushes
for operating the commutator drive mo-
tor and interference-suppression elements
(inductance coils and, if necessary, capaci-
tors).

Fuel supply

(cid:2) Electric motor (B) with armature and per-
manent magnet (a copper commutator is
standard, carbon commutators are used for
special applications and diesel systems).
(cid:2) Pump section (C), designed as a positive-

displacement or flow-type pump.

Types
Positive-displacement pump
In a positive-displacement pump, volumes
of liquid are basically drawn in and trans-
ported in a closed chamber (apart from
leaks) by rotation of the pump element to
the high-pressure side. A roller-cell pump
(Fig. 2a), an internal-gear pump (Fig. 2b) 
or a screw-spindle pump may be used for 
the electric fuel pump. 

Positive-displacement pumps are advanta-
geous at high system pressures (450 kPa and
above) and have a good low-voltage charac-
teristic, i.e., they have a relatively “flat” deliv-
ery-rate characteristic over the operating
voltage. Efficiency can be as high as 25 %.
Pressure pulsations, which are unavoidable,
can cause audible noise depending on the
particular design details and installation
conditions.

Whereas in electronic gasoline-injection
 systems the positive-displacement pump 
has to a large extent been superseded by 
the flow-type pump for the classical electric-
fuel-pump requirements, it has gained a new
field of application as the pre-supply pump
on direct-injection systems (gasoline and
diesel) with their significantly greater pres-
sure requirements and viscosity range.

Electric fuel pump

In future systems, pure pump control will 
be extended to included further functions.
Examples include: 
(cid:2) Tank-leakage diagnosis and evaluation of

the fuel-level-sensor signal 

(cid:2) Actuation of valves, e.g., for fuel-vapor

management 

In order to comply with the increasing de-
mands with regard to pressure and service
life and the differing fuel grades around the
world, non-contact motors with electronic
commutation will play a more important
role in the future.

Fuel-supply modules
Whereas in the early stages of electronic
gasoline injection the electric fuel pump 
was mounted exclusively outside the fuel
tank (in-line), it is common practice today
to install the electric fuel pump inside the
tank itself. In this case, the electric fuel
pump forms an integral part of a fuel-
 supply module which may comprise 
further  elements: 

3

Fuel-supply module

Flow-type pump
The flow-type pump has become the ac-
cepted solution for gasoline applications 
up to 500 kPa. An impeller with numerous
blades (Fig. 2c, Pos. 6) around its periphery
rotates in a chamber consisting of two fixed
housing sections. These housing sections
feature a passage (7) in each case in the area
of the impeller blades. These passages begin
at the height of the intake port (A) and end
at the point where the fuel exits the pump
section at system pressure (B). For the pur-
pose of improving the hot-delivery charac-
teristics, a small degassing bore is provided
at a given angle and distance from the intake
port, which (at the expense of a very slight
internal leakage) facilitates the exit of any
gas bubbles which may be in the fuel.

Pressure builds up along the passage as 
a result of the exchange of pulses between
the impeller blades and the liquid particles.
This leads to spiral-shaped rotation of the
liquid volume trapped in the impeller and 
in the passages.

Flow-type pumps feature a low noise 
level since pressure buildup takes place con-
tinuously and is practically pulsation-free.
They are much simpler in terms of design
and construction than positive-displace-
ment pumps. Single-stage pumps can gener-
ate system pressures of up to 500 kPa. 
The efficiency of these pumps can be 
as high as 22 %. 

Outlook
Some modern vehicles are already supplied
with fuel by demand-controlled fuel-supply
systems. In these systems, an electronic
module drives the pump as a function of 
the required pressure, which is monitored 
by a fuel-pressure sensor. The advantages 
of such systems are: 
(cid:2) Low current consumption 
(cid:2) Reduced heat entry through the electric

motor

(cid:2) Reduced pump noise, and
(cid:2) Possibility of setting variable pressures in

the fuel system

Filter medium
Special resin-impregnated microfiber papers
which are also bonded for higher-duty ap-
plications to a synthetic-fiber (meltblown)
layer are used as the filter medium. This
bond must ensure high mechanical, thermal
and chemical stability. The paper porosity
and the pore distribution of the filter paper
determine the filtration efficiency and
throughflow resistance of the filter. 

Filters for gasoline engines are either spiral
vee-form or radial vee-form in design. In a
spiral vee-form filter (Fig. 1), an embossed
filter paper is wrapped round a support
tube. The unfiltered fuel flows through the
filter in the longitudinal direction. 

In a radial vee-form filter (Fig. 2), the filter
paper is folded and inserted into the hous-
ing in the shape of a star. Plastic, resin or
metal end rings and, if necessary, an inner
protective jacket provide stability. The unfil-
tered fuel flows through the filter from the
outside inwards, during which the dirt parti-
cles are separated from the filter medium.

Gasoline filter

The function of the gasoline filter is to
 absorb and permanently accumulate dirt
particles from the fuel so as to protect the
fuel-injection system against wear caused 
by particle erosion. 

Design
Fuel filters for gasoline engines are located
on the pressure side after the fuel-supply
pump. In-tank filters are the preferred
choice in newer vehicles, i.e., the filter is in-
tegrated in the fuel tank. In this case, it must
always be designed as a lifetime filter, which
does not need to be changed over the full
service life of the vehicle. Furthermore,  
in-line filters, which are installed in the fuel
line, continue to be used. These can be de-
signed as replacement parts or lifetime parts. 

The filter housing is manufactured from
steel, aluminum or plastic. It is connected to
the fuel feed line by a thread, tube or quick-
action connection. The housing contains the
filter element, which filters the dirt particles
out of the fuel. The filter element is inte-
grated in the fuel circuit in such a way that
fuel passes through the entire surface of the
filter medium as much as possible at the
same flow velocity.

Gasoline filter

Filtration effects
Solid dirt particles are separated both by
means of the straining effect and by means
of impact, diffusion and barrier effects. 
The straining effect is based on the fact that
larger particles on account of their dimen-
sions cannot pass through the filter’s pores. 

Smaller particles, on the other hand,
 adhere to filter-medium fibers when they
strike these fibers. Three different mecha-
nisms are distinguished here: In the case of
the barrier effect, the particles are flushed
around the fibers with the fuel flow, but
touch the edges of these fibers and are re-
tained on these edges by intermolecular
forces. Heavier particles, because of their
mass inertia, do not follow the fuel flow
around the filter fibers; instead, they strike
the fibers frontally (impact effect). In the
case of the diffusion effect, very small parti-
cles, on account of their proper motion
(Brownian molecular motion), touch filter
fibers by chance, at which point they adhere
to the fibers. 

The filtration efficiency of the individual
effects is dependent on the size, the material
and the rate of flow of the particles. 

Requirements 
The required filter fineness is dependent 
on the fuel-injection system. For manifold-
injection systems, the filter element has a
mean pore size of approximately 10 μm.
Gasoline direct injection requires finer fil-
tration. The mean pore size is in the range 
of 5 μm. Particles which are more than 5 μm
in size must be separated at a rate of 85 %.
In addition, a filter for gasoline direct injec-
tion, when new, must satisfy the following
residual-dirt requirement: Metal, mineral
and plastic particles and glass fibers with
 diameters of more than 200 μm must be
 reliably filtered out of the fuel. 

Filter efficiency depends on the through-

flow direction. When replacing in-line fil-
ters, it is imperative that the flow direction
specified by the arrow be observed. 

The interval for changing conventional in-
line filters is, depending on filter volume 
and fuel contamination, normally between
30,000 km and 90,000 km. In-tank filters
generally have change intervals of at least
160,000 km. There are in-tank and in-line
filters available for use with gasoline direct-
injection systems which feature service lives
in excess of 250,000 km.

High-pressure pumps for gasoline direct injection

85

High-pressure pumps for
gasoline direct injection

Function 
The function of the high-pressure pump
(German: Hochdruckpumpe, hence HDP) is
to compress a sufficient quantity of the fuel
delivered by the electric fuel pump at an ad-
mission pressure of 0.3...0.5 MPa (3...5 bar)
to the level required for high-pressure injec-
tion of 5...12 MPa (1st-generation direct
 injection) or 5...20 MPa (2nd-generation
 direct injection).

Different high-pressure pumps are used in

the various direct-injection systems.

Types
HDP1 (1st-generation direct injection, 
continuous- delivery)
Design and method of operation 
The HDP1 is a radial-piston pump with
three delivery barrels situated at circumfer-

ential offsets of 120°. Figure 1 shows the lon-
gitudinal and cross-sections of the HDP1.
Driven by the engine camshaft, the drive
shaft (13) rotates with the eccentric cam (1).
The eccentric cam converts the rotational
motion via the cam ring (10) and the 
slipper (2) in a vertical motion of the pump
pistons (4). The drive runs in gasoline for
cooling and lubrication purposes. 

The fuel delivered by the electric fuel
pump passes enters the HDP1 through the
fuel inlet (9). The pump pistons contain
transverse and longitudinal ports, through
which the fuel enters the displacement
chambers of the three delivery barrels. 
As the pump piston travels from top to
 bottom dead center, the fuel is drawn in
through the inlet valve (7). In the delivery
stroke, the drawn-in fuel is compressed as
the pump piston travels from bottom to 
top dead center and delivered through the
outlet valve into the high-pressure area.

Fuel supply

High-pressure pumps for gasoline direct injection

The HDP1 is a continuous-delivery fuel-
supply pump, its delivery quantity being
proportional to rotational speed. The three
barrels deliver fuel at circumferential offsets
of 120° in order to ensure overlapping and
therefore continuous delivery. This gives rise
to minimal pressure pulsations only. This
means that, when compared with demand-
controlled systems with single-barrel
pumps, less demands have to be placed on
the pump connections and piping. Further-
more, there is no need for a low-pressure at-
tenuator.  The system can therefore also be
integrated relatively easily in already existing
engine platforms from manifold-injection
development. 

To ensure that the system pressure can 
be varied at sufficient speed even in the event
of maximum engine fuel demand, the maxi-
mum delivery quantity of the HDP is config-
ured for maximum demand. Factors influ-
encing delivery performance (e.g., hot gaso-
line, pump ageing, dynamics) are taken into
account. When operating at constant rail
pressure or at part load, the pressure-control
valve depressurizes the excess delivered fuel
quantity to admission pressure level, and the
fuel is returned to the suction side of the
HDP. The pressure level in the high-pressure
circuit is regulated and adjusted by means of
the engine ECU, which specifically actuates
the pressure-control valve. 

If one or more of the delivery barrels
should fail, emergency operation is possible
with the intact barrels or by means of the
electric fuel pump with admission pressure.

HDP2 (1st-generation direct injection, 
demand-controlled)
Design and method of operation
The HDP2 (Fig. 3) is a cam-driven single-
barrel pump that runs in oil with an inte-
grated fuel-supply control valve (10) and a
pressure attenuator (11) on the low-pressure
side. The fuel-supply control valve facilitates
control intervention on the high-pressure
side. The HDP2 is driven via the engine’s
 intake or exhaust camshaft such that it is
ideally mounted as a plug-in pump directly
on the cylinder head. 

The rotational motion of the camshaft is 
– depending on the engine’s fuel demand –
is transmitted via two or three cams to the
pump piston (Fig. 2). A barrel tappet pro-
vides the connection between the camshaft
and the delivery barrel for all cam variants.
The fuel delivered by the electric fuel
pump is drawn into the delivery chamber
via the inlet valve (Fig. 3, Pos. 5). In the suc-
tion stroke, the fuel-supply control valve is
not actuated (unenergized) and the fuel is
drawn in through the inlet valve (spring-
loaded non-return valve). In the delivery
stroke, the fuel-supply control valve is closed
from bottom dead center; the fuel is com-
pressed and delivered to the high-pressure
circuit. Actuation of the fuel-supply control
valve is deactivated when the fuel quantity
required in the relevant load state is reached.

The fuel that is not required is returned 
at admission pressure to the low-pressure
circuit. 

The volumetric efficiency is derived from
the ratio of actually delivered fuel quantity
to theoretically possible quantity. This is de-
pendent on the piston diameter and stroke.
The volumetric efficiency is not constant
over the full rotational speed (Fig. 4). It is
dependent on the following factors:
(cid:2) In the lower speed range: piston and other

leakages

(cid:2) In the upper speed range: inertia and
opening pressure of the inlet valve

(cid:2) In the total speed range: dead volume of
the delivery chamber and temperature
 dependence of fuel compressibility

The HDP2.1 is an aluminum variant of the
HDP2. A stainless-steel variant, the HDP2.5,
is a further development in terms of resis-
tance to media (e.g., fuels containing
ethanol).

HDP2 single-barrel pump

Pressure attenuator DD
The DD pressure attenuator (German:
Druckdämpfer) (Fig. 3, Pos. 11) is integrated
in the HDP2. Its function is to limit the
pressure pulsations that occur in the lower-
pressure circuit to ±1 bar. This is achieved
by the pressure attenuator taking up the
 diverted fuel quantity and releasing it again
in the subsequent suction stroke. In addi-
tion, it supports the filling process of the

This ensures that an additional vacuum 
is not generated by the inertia of the fuel
during intake. 

In the pressure attenuator, an elastomer
diaphragm separates the fuel-filled admis-
sion-pressure chamber from a spring cham-
ber. The pressure range of the pressure
 attenuator is adjusted in accordance with 
the vehicle manufacturer’s instructions
 (depending on the maximum occurring
pump or fuel temperature) via the inserted
spring (Fig. 5). As fuel temperature in-
creases, a higher pressure is needed to
 prevent vapor-bubble formation (Fig. 6).

MSV1 fuel-supply control valve
Demand control of the HDP2 high-pressure
pump is effected with the MSV1-type fuel-
supply control valve (German: Mengen -
steuerventil, hence MSV). Only the required
fuel quantity is delivered at high pressure to
the fuel rail. The MSV is therefore referred
to as a metering unit.

The MSV (Fig. 7) is an electrically
switched solenoid valve which is open at
zero current. When the solenoid coil (3) is
energized, the valve needle (4) is drawn into
its seat so that the required delivery pressure
can be built up in the delivery stroke. The
delivery period of the pump is determined
as a function of load by the actuation period
of the MSV. It is also dependent on the rail
pressure, which is recorded by a pressure
sensor and regulated to a specified value. 

During the suction stroke, fuel flows from
the low-pressure are through the inlet valve
into the delivery chamber. The delivery
stroke begins after the pump piston has
reached bottom dead center. The fuel is
compressed and delivered via the outlet
valve to the high-pressure area as soon as 
the fuel pressure in the pump exceeds the
pressure obtained in the rail. The opening
pressure of the outlet valve is negligible by
comparison with the rail pressure.

HDP5 (2nd-generation direct injection)
Design and method of operation
The HDP5 (Fig. 10) is a cam-driven single-
barrel pump that runs in oil with an inte-
grated fuel-supply control valve (metering
unit), a pressure-limiting valve on the high-
pressure side and an integrated pressure
 attenuator (on the low-pressure side). 
Like the HDP2, it is mounted as a plug-in
pump on the cylinder head. 

The point of connection between the
camshaft and the delivery barrel is provided
in the case of two cams by a barrel tappet
and in the case of three and four cams by a
roller tappet (Fig. 9). This ensures that the
cam-lifting curve is transmitted to the deliv-
ery plunger/piston. Here, the requirements
with regard to criteria such as lubrication,
Hertzian stress and mass inertia are greater
than for the HDP2. During the cam lift, the
roller tappet travels with it roller down the
cam profile. This results in the vertical mo-
tion, or stroke, of the delivery plunger.

In the delivery stroke, the roller tappet ab-
sorbs the applied forces, such as pressure,
mass, spring and contact forces. It is rota-
tionally secured in the process. 

With four cams, time synchronization 
of delivery and injection is possible in a 
4-cylinder engine, i.e., each injection is also

accompanied by a delivery. In this way, it is
possible on the one hand to reduce excita-
tion of the high-pressure circuit and on the
other hand to reduce the rail volume. 

MMD pressure attenuator
The variable pressure attenuator
(0.05...0.6 MPa) of the HDP5 attenuates 
the pressure pulsations excited by the high-
pressure pump in the low-pressure circuit
and also guarantees good filling at high
speeds. The pressure attenuator takes up 
the fuel quantity diverted at the relevant
 operating point via the deformation of its
gas-filled diaphragms and releases it again 
in the suction stroke to fill the delivery
chamber. Operation with variable admission
pressure – i.e., the use of demand-controlled
low-pressure systems – is possible here.

the electric fuel pump is drawn into the
 delivery chamber via the inlet valve of the
open fuel-supply control valve. In the sub -
sequent delivery stroke, the MSV remains
open after bottom dead center so that fuel
that is not needed at the relevant load point
is returned at admission pressure to the low-
pressure circuit. After the MSV is actuated,
the inlet valve closes, the fuel is compressed
by the pump plunger and delivered to the
high-pressure circuit (Fig. 11). The engine-
management system calculates the time
from which the MSV is actuated as a func-
tion of delivery quantity and rail pressure. 
In contrast to the MSV of the HDP2, the
start of delivery is  varied for demand
 control.

Fuel supply

Fuel rail

Fuel rail

Manifold injection
The function of the fuel rail is to store the
fuel required for injection and to ensure a
uniform distribution of fuel to all the fuel
injectors. The fuel injectors are mounted
 directly on the fuel rail. In addition to the
injectors, the fuel rail usually accommodates
the fuel-pressure regulator and possibly even
a pressure attenuator. 

Local pressure fluctuations caused by

 resonance when the injectors open and close
is prevented by careful selection of the fuel-
rail dimensions. As a result, irregularities 
in injected fuel quantity which can arise 
as a function of load and engine speed 
are avoided.

Depending upon the particular require-
ments of the vehicle in question, stainless-
steel or plastic fuel rails are used. The fuel
rail can incorporate a diagnosis valve for
garage/workshop testing purposes.

Gasoline direct injection
The function of the KSZ-HD fuel rail 
(Fig. 12) is to store and distribute the re-
quired fuel quantity for the respective oper-
ating point. The fuel is stored by way of its
volume and compressibility. In this way, 

12

Fuel rail (example of 1st-generation direct-injection system)

the volume is application-dependent and
must be adapted to the relevant engine
 demand and pressure range. 

The volume ensures attenuation in the
high-pressure range, i.e., pressure fluctua-
tions in the rail are compensated.

The add-on components for the direct-
 injection  system are mounted on the rail:
the high-pressure fuel injectors (German:
Hoch druckeinspritzventile, hence HDEV),
the pressure sensor for regulating the high
 pressure and – for the 1st-generation direct-
injection system – the pressure-control or
pressure-limiting valve.

The fuel rail for 1st-generation direct-
 injection systems are designed for a pressure
range of 0.4...12 MPa (plus 0.5 MPa opening
pressure of the pressure-limiting valve). 
For the 2nd generation, the pressure range
stretches up to 25 MPa (plus 1.2 MPa open-
ing pressure of the pressure-limiting valve). 
The burst pressure is higher.

The KSZ-HD fuel rail is manufactured 
for direct-injection systems with HDP1 and
HDP2 from shell cast aluminum. When used
with the HDP5, the fuel rail is made from
hard-soldered stainless steel.

in the fuel rail. This is achieved by altering
the flow cross-section in the valve. 

Design and method of operation 
The pressure-control valve (Fig. 13) is a
 proportional control valve which is closed 
at zero current and actuated by means of a
pulse-width-modulated signal. During oper-
ation, the energizing of the solenoid coil (3)
sets a magnetic force which relieves the load
on the spring, lifts the valve ball (8) off the
valve seat (9), and thereby alters the flow
cross-section. The DSV sets the desired rail
pressure as a function of the pulse duty fac-
tor (Fig. 14). The excess fuel delivered by 
the HDP1 is diverted into the low-pressure
circuit.

A pressure-limiting function is integrated

by way of the valve spring to protect the
components against unacceptably high 
rail pressures, for example, in the event 
of actuation failure.

Pressure-limiting valve

Function
The pressure-limiting valve (German:
Druckbegrenzungsventil, hence DBV) is
used in 1st-generation direct-injection sys-
tems with the demand-controlled HDP2
high-pressure pump. It prevents the fuel
pressure from reaching unacceptably high
levels when the fuel-supply control valve is
non-operational (HDP2 delivers continu-
ously). The DBV limits the fuel pressure in
the high-pressure system to a value below
the burst pressure. On the other hand, the
DBV ensures the operation of the high-pres-
sure fuel injectors through the flat pressure
curve over the volumetric flow even in nor-
mal operation at operating points without
fuel-supply control intervention (overrun
and shutdown). To be exact, no fuel is in-
jected at these operating points such that 
the stored quantity is heated up by the heat
from the engine. Each degree of temperature
rise results in a pressure increase of roughly
1 MPa. If the pressure is too high, the fuel

injector is no longer able to open against the
high fuel pressure. This means that reuse
 after overrun fuel cutoff or short-term
restarting of the engine  after a hot shutdown
would not be possible without pressure limi-
tation.

Design and method of operation
The DBV is mounted on the fuel rail in
 direct-injection systems with a HDP2 
(1st-generation direct injection) and sepa-
rates the high-pressure area from the low-
pressure area. At low fuel pressure, the valve
spring (Fig. 15, Pos. 1) presses the valve ball
(4) into its seat and seals the high-pressure
area from the low-pressure area. In the event
that the pressure increases to levels above
the opening pressure, the ball is lifted off its
seat to allow the compressed fuel to flow off
into the low-pressure area. The pressure is
relieved via the DBV. 

The DBV is not designed for continuous
operation at full delivery flow and must be
replaced together with the high-pressure
pump in the event of a fault. 

The pressure-limiting valve is integrated
in the HDP5 in 2nd-generation direct-injec-
tion systems.

Fuel-pressure regulator

Function 
The DR2 fuel-pressure regulator is used in
manifold-injection systems. The amount 
of fuel injected by the injector (injected fuel
quantity) depends upon the injection period
and the pressure differential between the
fuel pressure in the fuel rail and the counter-
pressure in the manifold. On fuel systems
with fuel return, the influence of pressure 
is compensated for by a pressure regulator
which maintains the differential between
fuel pressure and manifold pressure at a
constant level. This pressure regulator per-
mits just enough fuel to return to the fuel
tank so that the pressure drop across the in-
jectors remains constant. In order to ensure
that the fuel rail is efficiently flushed, the
fuel-pressure regulator is normally located 
at the end of the rail.

On returnless fuel systems, the pressure
regulator is part of the in-tank unit installed
in the fuel tank. The fuel-rail pressure is
maintained at a constant level with reference
to the ambient pressure. This means that the
pressure differential between fuel-rail pres-
sure and manifold pressure is not constant
and must be taken into account when the
injection duration is calculated.

Fuel-pressure regulator, fuel-pressure damper

95

Design and method of operation
The fuel-pressure regulator (Fig. 16) is of the
diaphragm-controlled overflow type. 
A rubber-fabric diaphragm (4) divides the
pressure regulator into a fuel chamber and a
spring chamber. Through a valve holder (3)
integrated in the diaphragm, the spring (2)
forces a movable valve plate against the valve
seat so that the valve closes. As soon as the
pressure applied to the diaphragm by the fuel
exceeds the spring force, the valve opens
again and permits just enough fuel to flow
back to the fuel tank that equilibrium of
forces is achieved again at the diaphragm. 
On multipoint fuel-injection systems, 
in  order that the manifold vacuum can be
 applied to the spring chamber, this is con-
nected pneumatically to the intake manifold
at a point downstream of the throttle plate.
There is therefore the same pressure ratio 
at the diaphragm as at the injectors. This
means that the pressure drop across the injec-
tors is solely a function of spring force and
diaphragm surface area, and therefore re-
mains constant. 

Fuel-pressure damper

The repeated opening and closing of the in-
jectors, together with the periodic supply of
fuel when electric positive-displacement fuel
pumps are used, leads to fuel-pressure oscilla-
tions. These can cause pressure resonances
which adversely affect fuel-metering accuracy.
It is even possible that under certain circum-
stances, noise can be caused by these oscilla-
tions being transferred to the fuel tank and
the vehicle bodywork through the mounting
elements of the fuel rail, fuel lines, and fuel
pump. 

These problems are alleviated by the use of

special-design mounting elements and fuel-
pressure dampers.

The fuel-pressure damper is similar in 

design to the fuel-pressure regulator. 
Here too, a spring-loaded diaphragm sepa-
rates the fuel chamber from the air chamber.
The spring force is selected such that the dia -
phragm lifts from its seat as soon as the fuel
pressure reaches its working range. 
This means that the fuel chamber is variable
and not only absorbs fuel when pressure
peaks occur, but also releases fuel when the
pressure drops. In order to always operate in
the most favorable range when the absolute
fuel pressure fluctuates due to conditions 
at the manifold, the spring chamber can be
provided with an intake-manifold connec-
tion.  

Similar to the fuel-pressure regulator, the
fuel-pressure damper can also be attached 
to the fuel rail or installed in the fuel line. 
In the case of gasoline direct injection, it can
also be attached to the high-pressure pump.

Manifold injection

Overview

Manifold injection

In gasoline engines with manifold injection,
formation of the air/fuel mixture begins
outside the combustion chamber in the in-
take manifold. Since they were introduced
to the market, these engines and their con-
trol systems have been vastly improved.
Their superior fuel-metering characteristics
have enabled them to almost completely
 supersede the carburetor engine, which 
also operates with external air/fuel-mixture
formation.

Overview

High standards of smooth running and
emission behavior are made on motor vehi-
cles. This leads to strict requirements with
respect to the formation of the air/fuel mix-
ture. In addition to precise metering of the
injected fuel mass – matched to the air mass
inducted by the engine – perfectly timed in-
jection and targeting of the spray are crucial.
Because of the continual tightening of emis-
sion-control legislation, these requirements

1

Manifold injection (engine section)

are increasingly taking center stage. Accord-
ingly, this situation necessitates constant
 development of the fuel-injection systems.

In the field of manifold injection, the elec-
tronically controlled multi-point fuel-injec-
tion system represents state-of-the-art tech-
nology. This system injects the fuel intermit-
tently, and individually, for each cylinder
 directly onto its intake valves. The electronic
control facility is integrated in the ECU of
the engine-management system. Bosch’s
 version of this system is called Motronic.

Mechanical, continuous-injection multi-
point injection systems and single-point in-
jection systems no longer play a significant
role in new developments. With single-point
injection, the fuel is injected intermittently
but only via a single fuel injector ahead of
the throttle valve into the intake manifold.

Method of operation

Creation of the air/fuel mixture
In gasoline injection systems with manifold
injection, the fuel is introduced into the in-
take manifold or into the intake passage. For
this purpose, the electric fuel pump delivers
fuel to the fuel injectors. The fuel is applied
to the injectors at system pressure. In multi-
point injection systems, each cylinder is allo-
cated its own injector (Fig. 1, Pos. 5), which
injects fuel intermittently into the intake
manifold (6) or into the intake passage (7)
ahead of the intake valves (4). 

Mixture formation begins outside the
combustion chamber in the intake passage.
After injection, the air/fuel mixture created
flows in the subsequent induction stroke
through the opened intake valves into the
cylinder (1). In this process, the air mass is
metered by the throttle valve (Fig. 2, Pos. 2).
Depending on the engine type, each cylinder
utilizes one up to a maximum of three in-
take valves.

2

Components of a manifold-injection system

Fuel metering by the fuel injectors is con -
figured in such a way that fuel demand is
covered for all engine operating states. This
means that, on the one hand, sufficient fuel
must be introduced in the available time at
high engine speeds and loads. On the other
hand, it is also necessary to ensure a suffi-
cient minimal injected fuel quantity during
idle operation so as to facilitate stoichio -
metric engine operation (λ = 1). 

Measurement of the air mass
In order that the air/fuel mixture can be pre-
cisely adjusted, it is imperative that the mass
of the air which is used for combustion can
be measured exactly. The air-mass meter (1),
which is situated upstream of the throttle
valve, measures the air-mass flow entering
the intake manifold and sends a correspond-
ing electrical signal to the engine ECU. 

As an alternative, there are also systems 
on the market which use a pressure sensor 
to measure the intake-manifold pressure.
 Together with the throttle-valve setting and
the engine speed, these data are then used 
to calculate the intake-air mass.

Manifold injection

Method of operation

The Motronic ECU then utilizes the data 
on intake-air mass and the engine’s current
operating state to calculate the required fuel
mass.

(cid:2) Variable valve timing
(cid:2) Central spark-plug position
(cid:2) Increased compression
(cid:2) Exhaust-gas recirculation

Injection duration
The injection period, or duration, which 
is required to introduce the calculated fuel
mass is derived depending on the narrowest
cross-section in the fuel injector, its opening
and closing behavior, and the pressure dif-
ferential between the intake-manifold pres-
sure and the fuel pressure. 

Reduction of emissions
In recent years, advances in engine technol-
ogy have led to improved combustion pro -
cesses, producing lower untreated emissions.
Electronic engine-management systems
make it possible to inject precisely the re-
quired amount of fuel in accordance with
the inducted air mass, to control precisely
the moment of ignition, and to optimize
 actuation of all the available components
(e.g., electronic throttle device DV-E) de-
pending on the various engine operating
points. Along with enhancements in engine
power and performance, these advances 
also lead to substantial improvements in 
the quality of the exhaust gas. 

It is possible in combination with the ex-
haust-gas-treatment system to adhere to the
statutory exhaust-emission limits. Provided
the air/fuel mixture is stoichiometric (λ = 1),
the pollutants generated during the combus-
tion process can to a great extent be reduced
using the three-way catalytic converter. At
the majority of their operating points, mani-
fold-injection engines are therefore operated
with this air/fuel-mixture composition. 

On-engine measures
On-engine measures can be used to reduce
untreated emissions. The following mea-
sures are commonly encountered today:
(cid:2) Optimized combustion-chamber  

geo metry

(cid:2) Multi-valve technology

The task of reducing emissions is faced with
the additional challenge posed by the oper-
ating range of engine cold starting.

Cold starting
When the ignition key is turned, the starter
rotates and turns the engine over at starter
speed. The signals from the speed and phase
sensors (Fig. 2, Pos. 14 and 7) are collected.
The Motronic ECU uses these signals to de-
termine the piston positions of the individ-
ual cylinders. The injected fuel quantities are
calculated in accordance with the program
maps stored in the ECU and transmitted 
via the fuel injectors. The ignition is then
 activated. Engine speed is increased with 
the first combustion. 

Cold starting is characterized by different

phases (Fig. 3):
(cid:2) Starting phase
(cid:2) Post-start phase
(cid:2) Warming-up
(cid:2) Catalytic-converter heating

Starting phase
The range from the first combustion to the
first time the catalytic-converter-heating
speed is exceeded is called the starting phase.
An increased fuel quantity is required for
engine starting (roughly 3 to 4 times the
full-load delivery at approx. 20 °C). 

Post-start phase
In the subsequent post-start phase, the
charge and the injected fuel quantity are
successively reduced as a function of the
 engine temperature and the time already
elapsed since the end the starting phase. 

Warming-up phase
The post-start phase is followed by the
warming-up phase. An increased torque
 demand is required on account of the still
low engine temperature, i.e., there is still an

Manifold injection

Method of operation

99

increased fuel demand compared with the
demand when the engine is hot. In contrast
to the post-start phase, this additional de-
mand is only dependent on the engine tem-
perature and is required up to a specific
temperature threshold.

Catalytic-converter-heating phase
The catalytic-converter-heating phase refers
to the cold-starting range in which addi-
tional measures are used to achieve a quicker
heating-up of the catalytic converter. 

The limits of the different phases are fluid.
Depending on the respective engine system,
the warming-up phase can also extend be-
yond the catalytic-converter-heating phase.

Cold-starting problems
Fuel which precipitates during starting when
the engine is cold on the cold cylinder wall
does not evaporate immediately and there-
fore does not take part in the following com-
bustion. It enters the exhaust system during
the exhaust stroke and therefore does not
contribute to reducing torque. In order to
ensure stable engine revving-up, it is there-
fore necessary to provide an increased fuel
quantity in the starting and post-start
phases. 

Untreated HC and CO emissions rise
 dramatically when these unburnt fuel con-
stituents are discharged. Another complica-
tion is the fact that the catalytic converter
must attain a minimum temperature of
roughly 300 °C before it can start to convert
pollutant emissions. To encourage the cat-
alytic converter to reach its operating tem-
perature quickly, there are measures avail-
able which facilitate a quick heating-up of
the catalytic converter as well as additional
systems for thermal aftertreatment of the
 exhaust gas which are activated in the
 catalytic-converter-heating phase. 

Measures for heating up the catalytic
 converter
The following measures can be used to heat
up the catalytic converter quickly during
cold starting:
(cid:2) High exhaust-gas temperatures induced
by late ignition timing and high mass gas
flow

(cid:2) Catalytic converters mounted close to the

engine

(cid:2) Increased exhaust-gas temperature by
means of thermal aftertreatment

Thermal aftertreatment
The unburnt hydrocarbons are reduced in
the exhaust system by thermal afterburning
at high temperatures. In the case of a rich
air/fuel mixture, an injection of air (sec-
ondary-air injection) is required. In the 
case of a lean air/fuel mixture, afterburning
takes place with the residual oxygen in the
exhaust gas.

Manifold injection

Method of operation, instants of injection

Secondary-air injection
In the case of secondary-air injection, addi-
tional air is introduced into the exhaust sys-
tem after the starting sequence in the warm-
ing-up phase (λengine < 1). This results in an
exothermal reaction with the unburnt hydro-
carbons, which reduce the high HC and CO
concentrations in the exhaust gas. In addi-
tion, this oxidation process releases heat to
the exhaust gas, which in turn quickly heats
up the catalytic converter as it flows through.

Instants of injection

In addition to the correct injection duration,
a further parameter which is important for
optimization of the fuel-consumption and
exhaust-gas figures is the instant of injection
referred to the crankshaft angle. 

In considering the instant of injection
for each individual cylinder, a distinction 
is made between pre-intake and intake-syn-
chronous injection. Injection is said to be
pre-intake when the end of injection for the
cylinder in question occurs before the intake
valve and a majority of the fuel spray strikes
the base of the intake passage and the intake
valves. In contrast, intake-synchronous in-
jection takes place when the intake valves 
are open. 

If, on the other hand, the instant of injec-

tion of all the cylinders is considered in 
relation to each other, a distinction is made
 between the follow instants of injection 
(Fig. 4):

Instants of injection, mixture formation

101

Here, the possible variations are dependent
on the instant of injection actually used.
 Today, serial-individual fuel injection is used
almost exclusively. Simultaneous or group
fuel injection is still used only occasionally
during cold starting in the first combustion
processes. 

Simultaneous fuel injection
All injectors open and close together in this
form of fuel injection. This means that the
time which is available for fuel evaporation
is different for each cylinder. In order never-
theless to obtain efficient air/fuel-mixture
formation, the fuel quantity needed for
combustion is injected in two portions: 
half in one revolution of the crankshaft 
and the remainder in the next. 

In the case of this instant of injection,
pre-intake injection is not possible for all the
cylinders. It is sometimes necessary to inject
fuel into the open intake valve in that the
start of injection is already prespecified.

Group fuel injection
Here, the fuel injectors are combined to
form two groups. For one revolution of the
crankshaft, one injector group injects the
 total fuel quantity required for its cylinders,
and for the next revolution the second
group injects. This arrangement enables the
injection timing to be selected as a function
of the engine operating point, and avoids
the undesired injection of fuel into open
 intake ports in wide program-map ranges.
Here too, the time available for the evapora-
tion of fuel is different for each cylinder.

Sequential fuel injection (SEFI)
In the case of SEFI, the fuel is injected indi-
vidually for each cylinder. The fuel injectors
are actuated in succession in firing sequence.
The injection duration and the instant of
 injection referred to the top dead center of
the respective cylinder are the same for all
cylinders. Injection timing for each cylinder
is thus identical. Start of injection is freely
programmable and can be adapted to the
engine’s operating state.

Cylinder-individual fuel injection (CIFI)
CIFI offers the greatest degrees of freedom.
Compared to serial-individual fuel injection,
CIFI has the advantage that the duration 
of injection can be individually varied for
each cylinder. This permits compensation 
of irregularities, for instance with respect 
to cylinder charge. 

Stoichiometric operation of each cylinder
requires a cylinder-specific lambda record-
ing here. This necessitates an optimization
of the manifold geometry so as to avoid as
far as possible a mixing of the exhaust gas 
in the individual cylinders. 

CIFI is only used in engines in which
there are large cylinder-specific differences
in the intake geometry. 

Mixture formation

Mixture formation begins with the injection
of fuel into the intake manifold and extends
through the intake phase into the compres-
sion phase of the cylinder in question. It is
subject to many requirements, such as, for
example:
(cid:2) Provision of an ignitable mixture at the
spark plug at the moment of ignition
(cid:2) Good homogenization of the mixture in

(cid:2) Good dynamic behavior in non-station-

the cylinder

ary operation

(cid:2) Low HC emissions during cold starting

Mixture formation in manifold-injection
systems is complex. It ranges from the char-
acteristic of the primary fuel spray through
transportation of the spray in the intake
manifold, introduction of the spray into the
combustion chamber down to homogeniza-
tion of the mixture at the moment of igni-
tion. At the end of the day, optimal adapta-
tion of these processes will result in good
mixture preparation. Mixture preparation
differs to some extent for cold and hot en-
gine operation and is decisively influenced
by:

(cid:2) Engine temperature

tion chamber at the moment of ignition of
the respective cylinder.

Primary-droplet spray
The fuel spray directly after it emerges from
the fuel injector is referred to as the primary-
droplet spray. Small primary droplets broadly
encourage the fuel to evaporate. However, it 
is important to bear in mind here that only a
very small proportion of the introduced fuel
evaporates in the intake manifold when the
engine is cold on account of the low tempera-
ture. The majority of the fuel exists as wall-
applied film and is entrained in the air flow
during the intake phase. The actual mixture
preparation takes place in the cylinder. 

On the other hand, when the engine is
hot, a large proportion of the injected fuel
spray and some of the existing wall-applied
film already evaporates in the intake mani-
fold.

Instant of injection
The instant of injection has a significant in-
fluence on mixture formation and untreated
HC emissions, above all when the engine is
cold. 

Intake-synchronous injection
In the case of intake-synchronous injection,
some of the fuel is transported by the air
flow to the opposite cylinder wall in the di-
rection of the exhaust valves (Fig. 5a). This
fuel film (wall-applied film) does not evapo-
rate on the cold cylinder walls, does not take
part in the combustion process, and there-
fore passes unburnt into the exhaust port.
This results in increased untreated emissions.
Nowadays, intake-synchronous injection 
is used only rarely in cold starting. It is used
to increase power when the engine is run-
ning at normal (hot) operating temperature.
Because evaporation of the fuel takes place to
a large extent in the combustion chamber in
the case of intake-synchronous injection, the
fresh-air charge can be increased. The reason
for this is that the liquid fuel droplets in the
intake manifold have a smaller volume than
vapor. Furthermore, the process of the fuel
evaporating in the combustion chamber
cools the cylinder charge, which has a posi-
tive effect on the engine’s knock tendency. 

Pre-intake injection
It is possible with pre-intake injection 
(Fig. 5b) to achieve a significant reduction 
in pollutant emissions during cold starting.
The injected fuel is forced towards the center
of the combustion chamber and the unde-
sired formation of wall-applied film on the
exhaust-side cylinder wall is avoided.

Spray targeting
In addition to pre-intake injection, it is
 possible in combination with optimal spray
targeting (Fig. 6) to further reduce HC emis-
sions during cold starting. When the spray 
is targeted at the base of the intake port, 
the drawn-in spray is transported with in-
creased intensity towards the center of the
combustion chamber. This further reduces
the depositing of fuel on the exhaust-side
cylinder wall, which in turn manifests itself
in lower HC emissions in the starting phase. 
On the other hand, the depositing of fuel

on the base of the intake port results in an
increased formation of wall-applied film in
the intake manifold. Here, the application
expenditure for non-stationary operation
(load changes) is somewhat higher. On en-
gines with manifold injection, it is necessary
in the event of load changes to take into ac-
count the accumulated mass of wall-applied

Mixture formation

Secondary mixture preparation
The air flow also aids fuel preparation
 (secondary mixture preparation). If there 
is a differential pressure between the intake
manifold and the combustion chamber at
the moment when the intake valves open
(IO), the flow created influences the prepa-
ration and transportation of the fuel. If the
intake-manifold pressure is significantly
greater than the combustion-chamber
 pressure when the intake valve opens, the
air/fuel mixture and the wall-applied film 
in the valve gap are drawn into the combus-
tion chamber at greater speed. 

If the intake-manifold pressure is smaller

than the combustion-chamber pressure
when the intake valve opens, then hot ex-
haust gas from the previous combustion
flows back into the intake manifold. Here,
on the one hand, the flow encourages the
formation of wall-applied film and fuel
droplets, while, on the other hand, the hot
exhaust gas also supports evaporation of the
fuel. This process is particularly important
in cold starting in the warming-up and
 catalytic-converter-heating phases. 

film in the intake manifold. More wall-ap-
plied film builds up in the event of a sharp
load increase. The engine would lean briefly
if the accumulated mass of wall-applied 
film and its delayed introduction into the
combustion chamber were not taken into
account in the calculation of the required
injected fuel quantity. For this purpose, the
Motronic ECU incorporates wall-applied-
film compensation functions, for which data
must be obtained during application with
regard to the respective engine geometry
and spray targeting so as to guarantee to 
a large extent λ = 1 operation even in the
non-stationary operating state. 

Air flow
The air flow is decisively influenced by the
engine speed, by the geometric layout of the
intake port, and by the opening times and
the lift curve of the intake valves. Sometimes
charge-flow control valves (tumble) are used
in order additionally to bring an influence 
to bear on the flow direction as a function 
of the engine operating point. The objective
is to introduce the necessary air in the avail-
able time into the combustion chamber 
and to achieve good homogenization of the
air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber
up to the moment of ignition.

A strong internal cylinder flow encourages
good homogenization and facilitates an in-
crease in EGR compatibility, by means of
which it is possible to achieve fuel-consump-
tion and NOX reductions. However, a strong
internal cylinder flow reduces the charge at
full load, which results in a lowering of the
maximum torque and maximum power.

Ignition of homogeneous air/fuel mixtures

Spark plasma

Ignition of homogeneous
air/fuel mixtures

At the moment of ignition, the air/fuel mix-
ture in the combustion chamber is ideally
fully homogenized. Combustion of the
 mixture is initiated in a gasoline engine by
an electrical ignition spark. Here, very hot
spark plasma (ionized gas) is generated 
(Fig. 7) when high voltage is applied across
the spark-plug electrodes. The surrounding
air/fuel-vapor mixture is heated very inten-
sively in the area of the plasma, the ignition
volume, to start an accelerated chain reac-
tion. As a result, the temperature rises very
rapidly and a flame front is created.

A safe ignition process is dependent among
other things on
(cid:2) The introduced ignition energy
(cid:2) The spark duration
(cid:2) The local flow conditions in the combus-
tion chamber close to the spark-plug
 electrodes

(cid:2) The air/fuel ratio λ, and
(cid:2) The spark-plug geometry and configura-

tion in the combustion chamber

The flame front spreads in the event of non-
knocking combustion at subsonic speed in
the combustion chamber. A burnt zone is
created after the flame front. The homoge-
neous air/fuel mixture burns above the  
soot-emission limit with a characteristically
bluish flame.

The speed of the spreading flame front
 increases as the turbulence of the combus-
tion-chamber flow rises. The degree of flow
turbulence and thus the rate of combustion
also rise as engine speed increases. The result
of this is that the duration of combustion
assumes the same crankshaft-angle range
virtually independently of the engine speed.

The flame goes out close to the combustion-
chamber wall due to high heat losses, or
“flame quenching”. This results in the
 emission of unburnt fuel.

Electromagnetic fuel injectors

Electromagnetic 
fuel  injectors

Function
Electrically actuated fuel injectors spray fuel
into the intake manifold at system pressure.
They allow fuel to be metered in the precise
quantity required by the engine. They are ac-
tuated by output stages which are integrated
in the engine ECU with the signal calculated
by the engine-management system.

1

EV14 electromagnetic fuel injector

Design and method of operation
Essentially, electromagnetic injectors (Fig. 1)
are comprised of the following components: 
(cid:2) Valve housing (3) with electrical connec-

tion (4) and hydraulic port (1)

(cid:2) Solenoid coil (9)
(cid:2) Moving valve needle (10) with solenoid

armature and valve ball (11) 

(cid:2) Valve seat (12) with injection-orifice plate

(13), and

(cid:2) Valve spring (8)

In order to ensure trouble-free operation,
stainless steel is used for the parts of the in-
jector which come into contact with fuel.
The injector is protected against contamina-
tion by a filter strainer (6) at the fuel inlet.

Connections
On the injectors presently in use, fuel supply
to the injector is in the axial direction, i.e.,
from top to bottom (“top feed”). The fuel
line is secured to the hydraulic port by
means of a clamp. Retaining clips ensure
 reliable alignment and fastening. The sealing
ring (O-ring) (2) on the hydraulic port (1)
seals off the injector at the fuel rail.

The injector is electrically connected to

the engine ECU.

Injector operation
When the solenoid coil is de-energized, 
the valve needle and valve ball are pressed
against the cone-shaped valve seat by the
spring and the force exerted by the fuel pres-
sure. The fuel-supply system is thus sealed
off from the intake manifold. When the sole-
noid coil is energized, this generates a mag-
netic field which attracts valve-needle arma-
ture solenoid armature. The valve ball lifts
off the valve seat and the fuel is injected.
When the excitation current is switched off,
the valve needle closes again due to spring
force.

Fuel outlet
The fuel is atomized by means of an injec-
tion-orifice plate in which there are a num-
ber of holes. These holes (injection orifices)
are stamped out of the plate and ensure that
the injected fuel quantity remains highly
constant. The injection-orifice plate is in -
sensitive to fuel deposits. The spray pattern
of the fuel leaving the injector is produced
by the number of orifices and their configu-
ration. 

The injector is efficiently sealing at the
valve seat by the cone/ball sealing principle.
The injector is inserted into the opening
provided for it in the intake manifold. The
lower sealing ring provides the seal between
the injector and the intake manifold. 

Essentially, the injected fuel quantity per
unit of time is determined by 
(cid:2) The system pressure in the fuel-supply

 system 

and 

(cid:2) The back pressure in the intake manifold,

(cid:2) The geometry of the fuel-exit area 

Electrical activation
An output module in the Motronic ECU
 actuates the injector with a switching signal
(Fig. 2a). The current in the solenoid coil
rises (b) and causes the valve needle (c) to
lift. The maximum valve lift is achieved after
the time tpk (pickup time) has elapsed. Fuel
is sprayed as soon as the valve ball lifts off its
seat. The total quantity of fuel injected dur-
ing an injection pulse is shown in Fig. 2d.
Current flow ceases when activation is
switched off. Mass inertia causes the valve 
to close, but only slowly. The valve is fully
closed again after the time tdr (dropout time)
has elapsed.

When the valve is fully open, the injected

fuel quantity is proportional to time. The
non-linearity during the valve pickup and
dropout phases must be compensated for
throughout the period that the injector is
activated (injection duration). The speed 
at which the valve needle lifts off its seat 
is also dependent on the battery voltage.

Manifold injection

Electromagnetic fuel injectors

Designs
Over the course of time, the injectors have
been continually developed to adapt them 
to the ever-increasing demands regarding
engineering, quality, reliability, and weight.
This has led to a variety of different injector
designs.

EV14 injector
The EV14 injector is the standard injection
valve for today’s modern fuel-injection sys-
tems (Fig. 4). It is characterized by its small
external dimensions and its low weight. 
This injector therefore already provides 
one of the prerequisites for the design of
compact intake modules. 

In addition, the EV14 demonstrates excel-
lent hot-fuel performance, i.e., there is very
little tendency for vapor-bubble formation
when the fuel is hot. This facilitates the use
of returnless fuel-supply systems because 
in such systems the fuel temperature in the
injector is higher than in systems featuring
fuel return. 

4

EV14 family

Thanks to wear-resistant surfaces, the EV14
also demonstrates high endurance stability
and a long service life. Thanks to their highly
efficient sealing, these injectors fulfill all fu-
ture requirements regarding “zero evapora-
tion”, i.e., no fuel vapor escapes from them.

For better fuel atomization, the injection-
orifice plates with four orifices usually used
are replaced by multi-orifice plates with up
to 12 injection orifices. This reduces the
droplet size by up to 35 %.

There are a wide variety of injectors
 available for different areas of application.
These feature different lengths, flow classes,
and electrical properties. The EV14 is also
suitable for use with fuels which have an
ethanol content of up to 85 %. The EV14 is
currently undergoing tests to ascertain its
suitability for use with E100 (pure ethanol).

The EV14 is available in 3 different

lengths: compact, standard and long (Fig. 4).
This makes it possible to adapt individually
to the engine’s intake-manifold geometry.

Tapered-spray injectors are typically used in
engines which feature only one intake valve
per cylinder. However, the tapered spray is
also suitable for two intake valves.

Dual spray
Dual-spray formation is often used in en-
gines which feature two intake valves per
cylinder. Engines with three intake valves
per cylinder must be equipped with dual-
spray injectors.

The holes in the injection-orifice plate are
arranged in such a way that two fuel sprays –
which can be formed from a number of indi-
vidual sprays (two tapered sprays) – leave the
injector and impact against the respective
 intake valve or against the web between the
intake valves.

Gamma angle
Referred to the injector’s principle axis, the
fuel spray in this case (single spray and dual
spray) is at an angle, the offset spray angle. 
Injectors with this spray shape are mostly
used when installation conditions are diffi-
cult.

Spray formation
An injector’s spray formation, i.e., its spray
shape, spray angle, and fuel-droplet size,
 influences the formation of the air/fuel mix-
ture. It is therefore an important function 
of the fuel injector. 

The EV14’s atomizing capability has been

further improved compared with the EV6
thanks to the use of new processes for man-
ufacturing multihole injection-orifice plates
and to modified flow guidance. In this way,
highly homogeneous fuel sprays with
droplet sizes reduced by up to 50 % when
compared with four-hole plates are created.

Individual intake-manifold and cylinder-
head geometries make it necessary to have
different types of spray formation. Different
spray-formation variants are available in
 order to satisfy with these requirements. 
The spray shapes depicted in Figure 5 can be
created both as a four-hole variant and as a
multihole variant with reduced droplet size.

Tapered spray
Individual jets of fuel are discharged
through the holes in the injection-orifice
plate. The tapered spray cone results from
the combination of these fuel jets.

Gasoline direct injection

Overview, method of operation

Gasoline direct injection

Gasoline direct-injection engines generate
the air/fuel mixture in the combustion
chamber. During the induction stroke, only
the combustion air flows through the open
intake valve. The fuel is injected directly
into the combustion chamber by special
fuel injectors.

Overview

The demand for higher-power spark-igni-
tion engines, combined with the require-
ment for reduced fuel consumption, were
behind the “rediscovery” of gasoline direct
injection. The principle is not a new one. 
As far back as 1937, an engine with mechan-
ical gasoline direct injection took to the air
in an airplane. In 1951 the “Gutbrod” was
the first passenger car with a series-produc-
tion mechanical gasoline direct-injection
engine, and in 1954 the “Mercedes 300 SL”
with a four-stroke engine and direct injec-
tion followed.

1

Gasoline direct injection (engine section)

At that time, designing and building a di-
rect-injection engine was a very complicated
business. Moreover, this technology made
extreme demands on the materials used. The
engine’s service life was a further problem.
These facts all contributed to it taking so
long for gasoline direct injection to achieve
its breakthrough.

Method of operation

Gasoline direct-injection systems are charac-
terized by injecting the fuel directly into the
combustion chamber at high pressure (Fig. 1).
As in a diesel engine, air/fuel-mixture forma-
tion takes place inside the combustion cham-
ber (internal mixture formation). 

High-pressure generation
The electric fuel pump (Fig. 2, Pos. 19)
 delivers fuel to the high-pressure pump (4)
at a presupply pressure of 3...5 bar. The
 latter pump generates the system pressure
depending on the engine operating point
(requested torque and engine speed). The
highly pressurized fuel flows into and is
stored in the fuel rail (Fig. 1, Pos. 6).

Method of operation, combustion process

111

relation to those combustion processes which
work with charge stratification (stratified
concepts). In order to obtain the required
charge stratification, the injector fuel injects
the fuel into the air flow in such a manner
that it evaporates in a defined area. The air
flow then transports the mixture cloud in the
direction of the spark plug so that it arrives
there at the moment of  ignition.

A combustion process is often made up of

several different operating modes between
which the process switches as a function of
the engine operating point. Basically, the
combustion processes are divided into two
categories: stratified-charge and homoge-
neous combustion processes.

Homogeneous combustion process
In the case of the homogeneous combustion
process, usually a generally stoichiometric
mixture is formed in the combustion cham-
ber in the engine map (Fig. 3a), i.e. an air ra-
tio of λ = 1 always exists. In this way, the ex-
pensive exhaust-gas treatment of NOX emis-
sions which is required with lean mixtures is
avoided. Homogeneous concepts are there-
fore set out to be emission-reducing concepts.

The fuel pressure is measured with the  
high-pressure sensor and adjusted via the
pressure-control valve (in the HDP1) or 
the fuel-supply control valve integrated in
the HDP2/HDP5 to values ranging between
50 and 200 bar. 

The high-pressure fuel injectors (5) are
mounted on the fuel rail, also known as the
“common rail”. These injectors are actuated
by the engine ECU and spray the fuel into
the cylinder combustion chambers.

Combustion process

In the case of gasoline direct injection, the
combustion process is defined as the way in
which mixture formation and energy conver-
sion take place in the combustion chamber.
The mechanisms are determined by the
geometries of the combustion chamber and
the intake manifold, and the injection point
and the moment of ignition. Depending on
the combustion process concerned, flows of
air are generated in the combustion chamber.
The relationship between injected fuel and 
air flow is extremely important, above all in

The homogeneous combustion process is
 always run in homogeneous mode; there
may, however, also be a few special operating
modes which can be used differently from
engine to engine for specific application
purposes (see section entitled “Operating
modes”).

Stratified-charge combustion process
In the case of the stratified-charge combus-
tion process, the fuel is injected in a specific
map range (small load, low engine speed)
first during the compression stroke into the
combustion chamber, and transported as 
a stratified-charge cloud to the spark plug
(Fig. 3b, shown here in the wall-guided
combustion process). The cloud here is ide-
ally surrounded by pure fresh air. In this
way, an ignitable mixture is only present in
the local cloud. An air ratio of greater than 
1 exists generally in the combustion cham-
ber. This enables the engine to be operated
unthrottled in greater ranges, which results 
in increased efficiency on account of the
 reduced pumping losses. Stratified-charge
combustion processes are therefore run pre-
dominantly as a fuel-consumption concept.

Two different stratified-charge concepts may
be used: the wall/air-guided process and the
spray-guided process. 

Wall/air-guided combustion process
In wall/air-guided stratified-charge mode,
the injector is usually situated between the
intake valves. In this combustion process,
the fuel is usually injected at a pressure of 
50 to 150 bar. The mixture is transported 
via the piston recess, which either interacts
directly with the fuel (wall-guided) or guides
the air flow in the combustion chamber in
such a way that the fuel is directed on an air
cushion to the spark plug (air-guided). Real
stratified-charge combustion processes with
side injector installation usually combine
both processes, depending on the installa-
tion angle of the injectors and the injected
fuel quantity. At idle (low injected fuel
quantity), a wall-guided combustion process
barely strikes the piston recess; at higher
loads (high injected fuel quantity), a certain
quantity of fuel strikes the piston directly,
even in the case of the air-guided combus-
tion process.

The air flow can be configured as a swirl

or tumble flow.

Gasoline direct injection

Combustion process

113

Swirl air flow
The air drawn in through the open intake
valve generates a turbulent flow (rotational
air movement) along the cylinder wall 
(Fig. 4a). This process is also known as the
“swirl combustion process”. 

Tumble air flow
This process produces a tumbling air flow,
which in its movement from top to bottom
is deflected by a pronounced piston recess so
that it then moves upwards in the direction
of the spark plug (Fig. 4b).

4

Combustion process

a

b

c

Spray-guided combustion process
In the case of the spray-guided combustion
process, the injector is situated centrally at
the top in the roof of the combustion cham-
ber. The spark plug is installed next to the
injector (Fig. 4c). The advantage of this
arrangement is the possibility of the fuel
spray being directly guided to the spark plug
without having to take a circuitous route
through the piston or air flows. The disad-
vantage, however, is the short amount of
time available for mixture preparation.
Spray-guided stratified-charge combustion
processes therefore require a fuel pressure
increased to approximately 200 bar. 

In order to be able to ignite the mixture 

at the correct moment in time, the spray-
guided combustion process requires that 
the spark plug and fuel injector be exactly
positioned, and that the spray be precisely
targeted. With this process, the spark plug is
subjected to considerable thermal stressing
since under certain circumstances the hot
spark plug can be directly impacted by the
relatively cold jet of injected fuel.

When the combustion process is properly

configured, the spray-guided combustion
process demonstrates greater efficiency than
the other stratified-charge combustion pro -
cesses to such an extent that it can achieve
even greater consumption savings in com-
parison with stratified-charge mode with
the wall/air-guided combustion process. 

Outside the stratified-charge-mode range,

the engine is also run homogeneous mode
in the case of the stratified-charge combus-
tion process.

Gasoline direct injection

Operating modes

Operating modes

The different operating modes which are
used in gasoline direct injection are de-
scribed in the following. The appropriate
operating mode is set by the engine-man-
agement system, depending on the engine
operating point (Fig. 1).

Homogeneous
In homogeneous mode, the injected fuel
quantity is metered precisely to the fresh air
in the stoichiometric ratio of 14.7:1. Here,
the fuel is injected during the induction
stroke so that there is sufficient time re-
maining to homogenize the entire mixture.
For the purpose of protecting the catalytic
converter or increasing power at full load,
the engine is also operated with a slight 
fuel excess in parts of the operating map 
(λ < 1). 

Since the whole of the combustion cham-

ber is utilized, the homogeneous mode is
 required when high levels of torque are
 demanded. Because of the stoichiometric
air/fuel mixture, emissions of untreated
 pollutants are low in this operating mode;

1

Operating-mode map

these pollutants can also be fully converted
by the three-way catalytic converter.

In homogeneous operation, combustion
to a great extent corresponds to the combus-
tion for manifold injection.

Stratified charge
In stratified-charge mode, the fuel is first in-
jected during the compression stroke. Here,
the fuel is prepared only with part of the air.
A stratified-charge cloud which is ideally
surrounded by pure fresh air is created. 
The start of injection is very important in
stratified-charge mode. The stratified-charge
cloud must be not only sufficiently homoge-
nized at the moment of ignition but also
 positioned at the spark plug. 

Because a stoichiometric mixture is only

present locally in stratified-charge mode, 
the mixture is on average lean on account 
of the surrounding fresh air. This setup 
requires more expensive exhaust-gas treat-
ment since the three-way catalytic converter
is unable to reduce NOX emissions in lean-
burn operation.

Stratified-charge mode can only be run
within certain limits because at higher loads

soot and/or NOX emissions increase dramat-
ically and the fuel-consumption advantages
over homogeneous mode are lost. At lower
loads, stratified-charge mode is limited by
low exhaust-gas enthalpy, i.e., the exhaust-
gas temperatures become so low that the
catalytic converter cannot be kept at operat-
ing temperature by the exhaust gas alone.
The speed range is limited to approximately
3000 rpm in stratified-charge mode because
at speeds above this threshold the time avail-
able is no longer sufficient to homogenize
the stratified-charge cloud.

The stratified-charge cloud becomes lean

in the peripheral zone adjoining the sur-
rounding air. For this reason, there is an
 increase in untreated NOX emissions in this
zone during combustion. A high exhaust-
gas-recirculation rate provides a remedy 
in this operating mode. The recirculated
 exhaust gases lower the combustion temper-
ature and thereby reduce the temperature-
dependent NOX emissions.

Homogeneous lean
In the transitional range between stratified-
charge and homogeneous mode, the engine
can be run with a homogeneous lean air/fuel
mixture (λ > 1). Since the pumping losses are
lower due to “non-throttling”, fuel consump-
tion is lower in homogeneous lean mode
than in standard homogeneous mode with 
λ ≤ 1. However, this mode is accompanied by
increased NOX emissions since the three-way
catalytic converter is unable to reduce these
emissions in this range. Additional NOX ac-
cumulator-type catalytic converters mean
further efficiency losses as a result of the
 catalytic converter’s regeneration phases.

Homogeneous stratified charge
In homogeneous stratified-charge mode, 
the complete combustion chamber is filled
with a homogeneous lean basic mixture.
This mixture is created by injecting a basic
quantity of fuel during the induction stroke. 
Fuel is injected a second time (dual injec-

tion) during the compression stroke. This
leads to a richer zone forming in the area of

the spark plug. This stratified charge is easily
ignitable and can ignite the homogeneous
lean mixture in the remainder of the com-
bustion chamber with the flame along the
same lines as torch ignition.

The homogeneous stratified-charge mode

is activated for a number of cycles during
the transition between stratified-charge and
homogeneous modes. This enables the en-
gine-management system to better adjust
the torque during the transition. Due to the
conversion to energy of the very lean basic
mixture at λ > 2, the NOX emissions are also
reduced.

Gasoline direct injection

Operating modes

The distribution factor between the two
 injections is approximately 75 %, i.e., 75 %
of the fuel is injected in the first injection,
which is responsible for the homogeneous
basic mixture.

Steady-state operation using dual injec-
tion at low engine speeds in the transitional
range between stratified-charge and homo-
geneous modes reduces the soot emissions
compared to stratified-charge mode, and
lowers fuel consumption compared to
 homogeneous mode.

Homogeneous split
Homogeneous-split mode is a special appli-
cation of homogeneous stratified-charge
dual injection. It is used after the starting
phase to bring the catalytic converter up 
to operating temperature as quickly as pos -
sible. Ignition can be significantly retarded
(15...30° crankshaft after firing TDC) by 
the stabilizing effect of the second injection
during the compression stroke. A large pro-
portion of the combustion energy will then
no longer influence an increase in torque,
but rather increases exhaust-gas enthalpy.
Due to this high exhaust-gas heat flow, 
the catalytic converter is already ready for
operation just a few seconds after starting.

Homogeneous knock protection
In this operating mode, in view of the fact
that charge stratification hinders knock, ig-
nition-timing retardation as needed to avoid
knocking can be dispensed with through the
use of dual injection at full load. At the same
time, the more favorable ignition point also
leads to higher torque. In reality, the poten-
tial of this operating mode is very limited.

Stratified-charge/catalyst heating
Another form of dual injection makes 
it possible to heat up the exhaust system
quickly, although the exhaust system must
be optimized to accommodate this applica-
tion. Here, in stratified-charge mode with a
high level of excess air, injection is effected
first during the compression stroke (as in
stratified-charge mode) and then once again

during the power stroke. This fuel is com-
busted very late and causes the engine’s ex-
haust side and the exhaust manifold to heat
up dramatically. When the engine is cold,
however, this operating mode proves to be
very limited in its potential for application
to the extent that in this case homogeneous-
split mode is significantly superior.

A further important application is for heat-
ing up the NOX catalytic converter to tem-
peratures in excess of 650 °C in order to ini-
tiate desulfurization of the catalytic con-
verter. It is absolutely essential to use dual
injection here since this high temperature
cannot always be reached in all operating
modes with conventional heating methods. 

Stratified-charge starting
During stratified-charge starting, the quan-
tity of fuel for starting is introduced during
the compression stroke instead of conven-
tional injection during the induction stroke.
The advantage of this injection strategy is
based on the fact that fuel is injected into 
air that is already compressed and therefore
heated. In this way, more fuel evaporates in
percentage terms than under cold ambient
conditions, where a significantly larger pro-
portion of the injected fuel remains as liquid
wall-applied film in the combustion cham-
ber and does not take part in combustion.
The fuel quantity to be injected can there-
fore be reduced dramatically during strati-
fied-charge starting. This results in greatly
reduced HC emissions during starting.
 Because the catalytic converter cannot yet
operate at the moment of starting, this is an
important operating mode for developing
low-emission concepts.

In order to facilitate mixture preparation
in the short time available, stratified-charge
starting is performed at fuel pressures of
roughly 30...40 bar. These pressures can al-
ready be made available by the high-pressure
pump by way of the starter revolutions.

Gasoline direct injection

Mixture formation

117

Mixture formation

Function
It is the function of mixture formation to
provide a combustible air/fuel mixture
which is as homogeneous as possible. 

Requirements
In homogeneous operating mode (homoge-
neous λ ≤ 1 and also homogeneous lean), the
mixture should be homogeneous through out
the entire combustion chamber. In stratified-
charge mode, on the other hand, the mixture
is only homogeneous within a limited area,
while the remaining areas of the combustion
chamber are filled with inert gas or fresh air.
All fuel must have evaporated before a gas

mixture or gas/fuel-vapor mixture can be
termed homogeneous. Evaporation is influ-
enced by numerous factors, above all
(cid:2) Combustion-chamber temperature
(cid:2) Fuel-droplet size, and
(cid:2) Time available for evaporation

Influencing factors
Depending on the engine’s temperature,
pressure and combustion-chamber geome-
try, a mixture containing gasoline is com-
bustible within a range of λ = 0.6...1.6.

Temperature influence
The temperature has a decisive influence 
on fuel evaporation. At lower temperatures,
fuel does not evaporate completely. More
fuel must therefore be injected under these
conditions in order to obtain a combustible
mixture.

Pressure influence (fuel pressure)
The size of the droplets in the injected fuel 
is dependent on injection pressure and com-
bustion-chamber pressure. Higher injection
pressures result in smaller droplets, which 
then evaporate more quickly.

Geometry influence
With a constant combustion-chamber
 pressure and increasing injection pressure,
the so-called penetration depth increases.

The penetration depth is defined as the dis-
tance traveled by an individual fuel droplet
before it evaporates completely. The cylinder
wall or the piston will be wetted with fuel 
if the distance needed for full evaporation
exceeds the distance from the fuel injector 
to the combustion-chamber wall. If this wall-
applied film fails to evaporate in good time
by the point of ignition, it does not, or only
incompletely, takes part in combustion.

The geometry of the engine (intake mani-

fold and combustion chamber) is also re-
sponsible for the air flow and the turbulence
in the combustion chamber. Both factors
have a significant influence on mixture for-
mation because they determine both mixture
preparation and transportation of the ig-
nitable mixture during charge stratification
to the spark plug.

Mixture formation in homogeneous
mode
The fuel should be injected as early as possible
so that the maximum length of time is avail-
able for mixture formation. This is why the
fuel is injected during the induction stroke in
homogeneous mode. The intake air helps the
fuel to evaporate quickly and ensures that the
mixture is well homogenized. Mixture prepa-
ration is assisted above all by high flow veloci-
ties and their aerodynamic forces in the area
of the opening and closing intake valve.

Wall interaction is not desired and the
 associated evaporation of wall-applied film
plays a subordinate role here (Fig. 1).

Mixture formation in stratified-charge
mode
The configuration of the combustible mixture
cloud which is in the vicinity of the spark
plug at the moment of ignition is crucial to
stratified-charge mode. This is why the fuel 
is injected during the compression stroke so
that a mixture cloud is created which can be
transported to the vicinity of the spark plug
by the air flows in the combustion chamber
and by the upward stroke of the piston. The
injection point is dependent on the engine
speed and the requested torque.

Mixture formation

In stratified-charge injection, mixture
preparation profits from the higher temper-
ature and the already increased pressure in
the combustion chamber during the com-
pression phase. 

In the case of the wall-guided combustion
process, condensation of fuel on the piston
wall cannot be avoided, to such an extent
that some mixture preparation takes place in
the form of wall-applied-film evaporation
(Fig. 2).

Ignition

Homogeneous mixtures
The ignition conditions for homogeneous
mixtures with gasoline direct injection are 
to a large extent that same as those with
manifold injection (see chapter entitled
“Manifold injection”).

Stratified-charge mixtures
When engine operation is dethrottled, 
from a general point of view, extremely 
lean air/fuel mixtures must be ignited in the
lower part-load range. This is made possible
by the creation of charge stratification in the
area of the spark plug at the moment of ig-
nition. Ideally, this stratified air/fuel charge
is a virtually stoichiometric and thus easily
ignitable mixture.

After ignition, a flame core is formed in

the area of the stoichiometric stratified
charge. The amount of energy released here
is four times greater than that of an ignition
spark. In this way, mixture in lean peripheral
areas of the combustion chamber can also
be ignited.

Wall/air-guided combustion process
In the case of the wall/air-guided combus-
tion process, the injection time window
must be chosen such that the piston directs
the mixture cloud safely to the spark plug.
This transportation movement is usually
 assisted by combustion-chamber flows. 
The mixture must be ignited when it reaches
the spark plug, i.e. the moment of ignition 
is permanently linked in terms of time to 
the piston position – injection – mixture
transportation sequence and is no longer
available as a controlled variable of the
 combustion process.

When the piston surface is wetted with
fuel, this surface acts as a mixture-formation
component through its interaction with the
liquid fuel. Here, the fuel that adheres to the
surface evaporates at a relatively slow rate.
When the flame front arrives at the piston
surface, which is cold in comparison to the
flame, the flame goes out as a result of high

heat dissipation (quenching effect). The fuel
that has still not evaporated at this time is
not combusted and results in increased 
HC emissions.

The design of the piston surface, the com-
bustion-chamber flow forming in the vicin-
ity of the spark plug, and the injector quality
thus have a direct influence on the ignition
and burning performance.

Spray-guided combustion process
The close proximity of the spark plug and
the injector ensures that an ignitable mix-
ture concentration is available at the spark
plug, even in the event of small injected fuel
quantities. However, this also means that
only a very small time window is available
for evaporation and mixture preparation.
Fuel directly after it has left the injector 
is still unable to ignite since it has still not
evaporated sufficiently and is mixed with
surrounding air. Ignition significantly later
than injection is barely possible since the
mixture is increasingly removed from the
spark plug and therefore becomes lean. 
Ideal ignition conditions are therefore only
present during a relatively short period of
time. Typically, a rapidly growing flame core
in the now combustible air/fuel-vapor mix-
ture initiated by the ignition spark is formed
at the end of the injection process.

The following factors, among others, are

crucial to safe ignition:
(cid:2) An ignition spark lasting as long as

 possible

(cid:2) The quality of mixture preparation
(cid:2) The correct allocation of spark location

and fuel spray

(cid:2) Relatively precise adherence to the dis-

tance between spray and ignition location
(cid:2) Constancy of the spray in relation to the

combustion-chamber pressure

(cid:2) Invariance of the spray over the engine’s

entire service life

Gasoline direct injection

High-pressure injector

High-pressure injector

Function
It is the function of the high-pressure fuel
injector (HDEV) on the one hand to meter
the fuel and on the other hand by means of
its atomization to achieve controlled mixing
of the fuel and air in a specific area of the
combustion chamber. Depending on the
 desired operating mode, the fuel is either
concentrated in the vicinity of the spark
plug (stratified charge) or evenly distrib-
uted throughout the combustion chamber
 (homogeneous distribution).

Design and method of operation
The high-pressure injector (Fig. 1) com-
prises the following components:
(cid:2) Inlet with filter (1)
(cid:2) Electrical connection (2)
(cid:2) Spring (3)
(cid:2) Coil (4)
(cid:2) Valve sleeve (5)
(cid:2) Nozzle needle with solenoid armature (6),

and

(cid:2) Valve seat (7)

1

Design of HDEV5 high-pressure injector

A magnetic field is generated when current
passes through the coil. This lifts the valve
needle off the valve seat against the force  
of the spring and opens the injector outlet
passages (8). The system pressure now forces
the fuel into the combustion chamber. The
injected fuel quantity is essentially depen-
dent on the opening duration of the injector
and the fuel pressure. 

When the energizing current is switched

off, the valve needle is pressed by spring
force back down against its seat and inter-
rupts the flow of fuel.

Excellent fuel atomization is achieved
thanks to the suitable nozzle geometry at 
the injector tip. 

Requirements
Compared with manifold injection, gasoline
direct injection differs mainly in its higher
fuel pressure and the far shorter time which
is available for directly injecting the fuel into
the combustion chamber.

High-pressure injector

Figure 2 underlines the technical demands
made on the injector. In the case of manifold
injection, two revolutions of the crankshaft
are available for injecting the fuel into the
manifold. This corresponds to an injection
duration of 20 ms at an engine speed of
6000 rpm. 

In the case of gasoline direct injection,
however, considerably less time is available.
In homogeneous operation, the fuel must 
be injected during the induction stroke. 
In other words, only a half crankshaft rota-
tion is available for the injection process. 
At 6000 rpm, this corresponds to an injec-
tion duration of 5 ms.

With gasoline direct injection, the fuel
 requirement at idle in relation to that at 
full load is far lower than with manifold
 injection (factor 1:12). This results in an
 injection duration at idle of roughly 0.4 ms.

Actuation of HDEV high-pressure
 injector
The injector must be actuated with a highly
complex current characteristic in order to
comply with the requirements for defined,
reproducible fuel-injection processes 
(Fig. 3). The microcontroller in the engine
ECU delivers only a digital actuating signal
(a). An output module (ASIC) uses this
 signal to generate the actuating signal (b) 
for the injector. 

A DC/DC converter in the engine ECU
generates the booster voltage of 65 V. This
voltage is required in order to bring the cur-
rent up as quickly as possible in the booster
phase to a high current value. This is neces-
sary in order to accelerate the injector needle
as quickly as possible. In the pickup phase
(ton), the valve needle then achieves the max-
imum opening lift (c). When the injector is
open, a small actuating current (holding cur-
rent) is sufficient to keep the injector open. 
With a constant injector-needle lift, the
injected fuel quantity (d) is proportional 
to the injection duration.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Overview

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

The Association of European Vehicle Manu-
facturers (ACEA) has undertaken a commit-
ment to reduce average CO2 emissions to
140 g/km by the year 2008. This represents 
a reduction of 25 % when set against the fig-
ures recorded back in 1995. Vehicle concepts
based on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)
contribute to lowering CO2 emissions.
 Because natural gas is not yet extensively
available at filling stations, it should also 
be possible for the engine to be run on
gasoline.

The EU Commission has plans by 2020  
to replace 23 % of gasoline and diesel con-
sumption with alternative fuels in Europe.
The main contribution to this reduction – 
at 10 % – is to be made by natural gas 
(Fig. 1). 

Germany currently (as at: July 2005) has

roughly 30,000 natural-gas vehicles and
603 natural-gas filling stations. Because
 natural gas exhibits better environmental
properties than gasoline and diesel, its use 
in motor vehicles is to be encouraged up 
to 2020 in Germany by means of a lowered
tax on mineral oil. Thus, equivalent-energy
natural gas will be offered at filling stations
at prices which are roughly 50 % cheaper
than gasoline. 

Local efforts are also being made to use al-
ternative fuels in South America and parts of
Asia. Natural gas is leading the way in these
local schemes. 

Overview

Properties of natural gas
The primary constituent of natural gas is
methane (CH4). Natural gas therefore has
the highest hydrogen content of all the fossil
fuels. When it is burned, it creates approxi-
mately 25 % fewer CO2 emissions than gaso-
line while providing the same amount of
 energy.

Natural gas is available throughout the
world. Its composition, however, varies de-
pending on where it originates. These varia-
tions influence density, calorific value and
knock resistance. The use of natural gas in
motor vehicles has hitherto not been subject
to standardization. 

Another advantage is that methane can
also be regeneratively manufactured from
biomass. In this way, the CO2 cycle is com-
pleted and long-term availability can be
 increased.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Overview

123

Properties of natural-gas drives
Because of the simpler molecular structure
of methane and due to the fact that it is in-
troduced into the engine in gaseous form,
the untreated emissions (HC, NOX) from 
a natural-gas engine are significantly lower
than those from a gasoline engine. The emis-
sion of non-limited pollutants (aldehydes,
aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) and the emis-
sion of sulfur dioxide and particulates is vir-
tually avoided completely with natural gas.

Natural gas has a very high knock resistance
of up to 130 RON (by comparison, gasoline:
91...100). It is therefore possible, by compar-
ison with a gasoline engine, to increase com-
pression by approximately 20 % and thus
raise efficiency. At the same time, the nat-
ural-gas engine is ideally suited to super-
charging. In combination with a downsizing
concept, in which the engine displacement 
is reduced and at the same time the engine 
is supercharged to its original power output,
it is possible to obtain an additional im-
provement in efficiency and with it a 
further CO2 reduction.

Because natural gas is low in density, it is
more complicated to store it in a tank than 
it is to store gasoline and diesel. It is usually
stored in the vehicle in gas form at an over-
pressure of 200 bar in steel or carbon-fiber
tanks (hence the designation CNG = Com-
pressed Natural Gas). It requires four times
the conventional gasoline or diesel tank
 volume for the same energy content. It is
nevertheless possible through optimized in-
stallation of the pressure accumulators (e.g.,
locating the tanks under the vehicle floor-
pan) to achieve ranges of currently roughly
400 km without additionally having to re-
duce the size of the luggage compartment.

Alternatively, natural gas can also be
 liquified at temperatures of –162 °C 
(LNG = Liquefied Natural Gas). However,
the process of liquifying the gas expends 
a great deals of energy and the tanks are
 expensive. Today, almost exclusively CNG
tanks are used in passenger-car applications.
Because of the advantage of lower CO2
emissions and the possibility of adapting
gasoline engines to natural gas at relatively
little expense, natural gas fulfills a good
many of the conditions to be able to experi-
ence a dramatic upturn in use in the short
term.

Use of natural-gas vehicles
In Europe, natural-gas-powered vehicles
have up to now predominantly been used 
in commercial fleets (e.g. vehicle pools of
larger companies or city buses). The consis-
tent buildup of the CNG filling-station net-
work in Germany and agreements to pro-
vide natural gas at interstate-highway filling
stations is encouraging the further spread 
of natural-gas vehicles, even in private
 transport.

Today, the largest fleet of natural-gas vehi-

cles is in South America. This market has
been determined up to now by conversion
systems. However, a trend towards the series
production of natural-gas vehicles can also
be foreseen here. The greatest potential for
growth is to be anticipated in Asia, because
here, in addition to CO2 emission aspects,
underlying economic conditions promote
the use of natural gas. Natural-gas-produc-
ing countries, such as, for instance, Iran,
have a strong interest in using the gas in
 mobile applications as well.

In the NAFTA region (North America),
there are currently no significant develop-
ments to speak of because the market-struc-
ture incentives are lacking. Here the trend 
is more towards gasoline hybrid vehicles.

124

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Design and method of operation

Method of operation of fuel supply
in a natural-gas system 
The natural gas stored at approximately 
200 bar in the tanks (Fig. 3, Pos. 13) flows
through individual tank shutoff valves (12)
to the pressure-regulator module (6). The
electromagnetically actuated high-pressure
shutoff valve on the tank ensures that when
it is de-energized the tank is sealed off tight
when the vehicle is stationary. In the event
of a system failure, the pressure-limiting
valve ensures that unacceptably high pres-
sures in the system can be reduced.  

The pressure regulator reduces the gas
pressure from a tank pressure of roughly 
200 bar to a constant system pressure of
 approximately 7 bar. A coolant port serves 
to heat the natural gas cooled by expansion.
The high-pressure sensor enables the tank
fill level (fuel gage) to be determined and
can be called on for system diagnosis. 
In the interests of increasing the accuracy 
of the fill-level measurement, the pressure
measurement can be combined with a tem-
perature measurement. 

Design and method 
of  operation 

Because of the limited number of natural-
gas filling stations, today’s natural-gas vehi-
cles are primarily designed as bivalent vehi-
cles (bifuel and monovalent-plus vehicles),
i.e. as well as running on gas, they can also
be run on conventional gasoline. The basis
for the natural-gas system is the spark-igni-
tion engine with manifold injection (Fig. 3).
Additional components for supplying and
injecting natural gas are required. The
 Bifuel-Motronic ECU controls both fuel
 operating modes.

Monovalent-plus vehicles are optimized
for running on natural gas and only have a
15-l emergency gasoline tank. Today’s nat-
ural-gas tanks are made from steel or fiber
composites. For strength reasons, the shape
of the tank cannot be freely selected. This
often gives rise to problems of space in the
vehicle. A combination of several tanks,
sometimes even of different sizes, is there-
fore used in many vehicles.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Design and method of operation, mixture formation

125

The gas is directed from the pressure-regula-
tor module to the rail (7), which supplies
one injector (8) per cylinder. Mixture for-
mation is effected through the injection of
fuel into the intake manifold. A combined
low-pressure/temperature sensor (7) serves
to correct the metering of the gas. 

All the system components which may come
into contact with natural gas must be certi-
fied for use in accordance with European
 Directive ECE-R110. In Germany, the neces-
sary tests and inspections are carried out by
TÜV (German Technical Inspection Agency).

Mixture formation

An unusual feature of the natural-gas engine
is the injection of the fuel in gas form into
the intake manifold (Fig. 4). This is effected
along the same lines as gasoline by injection
into the intake manifold ahead of the intake
valves. 

The natural-gas injectors are supplied via a
common gas rail, which is connected to the
pressure regulator. The system pressure reg-
ulated to 7 bar is monitored by a diagnostic
function. For safety reasons, the gas-supply
system features in addition to the injectors
two gas shutoff valves on the tank and on

4

Installation positions of natural-gas and 
gasoline injectors

the pressure regulator which are electromag-
netically actuated by the engine-manage-
ment system. The shutoff valves are only
opened when both the ignition is switched
on and engine running is detected. This
safety function is necessary so that the gas
supply can be immediately and safely inter-
rupted in the event of a malfunction or an
accident.

As with gasoline injection, the system utilizes
sequential multipoint injection, whereby the
fuel is injected through an injector for each
cylinder in sequence into the respective in-
take port. This process provides for efficient
mixture preparation by means of precision-
timed injection control. The injector can 
be either completely opened or completely
closed. The injected gas quantity is adjusted
solely by way of the injector’s opening dura-
tion. The injector is opened once for every
induction stroke of the engine. 

In contrast to gasoline injection, gas injec-
tion involves a noticeable amount of fresh
air being displaced by the natural gas. Due
to the lower density of natural gas, at full
load approximately 10 % by volume of the
inducted air/fuel mixture consists of natural
gas. At the same time, however, this means
that natural-gas engines have a lower air de-
livery ratio. In naturally aspirated engines,
this can cause a reduction in power com-
pared with a gasoline engine. This can,
 however, be compensated for by higher
compression and turbocharging. With these
measures – combined with the high knock
resistance of natural gas – it is possible even
to achieve an increase in power compared
with a gasoline engine.

During the injection of natural gas – com-
parable with gasoline injection – the injec-
tion duration is calculated while taking into
account the injector constant. The injector
constant here is dependent on the design of
the injectors and defines the static through-
flow mfng0, which obtains under the stan-
dard condition and with flow above critical.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Mixture formation

The gaseous mass flow through the injector
is essentially calculated differently from a
 liquid fuel. 

The density of natural gas is much lower
than that of gasoline. In terms of gas-injec-
tor design, this results in larger opening
cross-sections. Furthermore, the density ρ
of gases is dependent on temperature T
and pressure p to a much greater extent 
than liquid fuels. 
The density ρNG of natural gas is:

ρNG = ρNG0 ·

pNG
p0

·

T0
TNG

(1)

The index 0 denotes the status under 
the standard condition: p0 = 1013 hPa, 
T0 = 273 K

A defined flow velocity is obtained in the
event of a gas flow above critical. This occurs
when the pressure ratio at the injector is
lower than 0.52. The gas then flows at the
speed of sound. A natural-gas admission
pressure in the gas rail of 7 bar (absolute
pressure) ensures both the supply of the
maximum natural-gas quantity required
and a flow at the speed of sound at every
 engine operating point, even with super-
charged engines. At the same time, it ensures
that the gas is metered independently of the
intake-manifold pressure.

The speed of sound is temperature-depen-
dent. In natural gas, it is:
cNG = cNG0 (cid:2)(cid:3)
TNG
T0

(2)

The obtained gas mass flow mfng is then
 calculated with (1) and (2):

The natural-gas mass flow is dependent
 linearly on the pressure and with the index
–1/2 on the temperature. The installation of
a natural-gas pressure and temperature sen-
sor in the natural-gas rail ensures that the
variables which influence the mass flow are
known. The injection duration is corrected
accordingly and the injected gas quantity
can thus be correctly introduced even under
changing ambient conditions. 

Two further corrections are needed for elec-
trical actuation of the injectors. The opening
delay of the injectors must be taken into
 account in the calculation of the opening
 duration; the opening delay is dependent 
on the battery voltage and also slightly on 
the admission pressure of the natural gas.
Particularly in the case of injectors with
metal/metal seals, the act of the injector clos-
ing can cause the valve needle to rebound as
it contacts the valve seat, a motion which re-
sults in an undesired increase in the injected
gas quantity. A correction based on the bat-
tery voltage and the natural-gas admission
pressure compensates for these effects.

To ensure optimal combustion, it is neces-
sary in addition to correct metering for 
the correct moment of injection to be deter-
mined as well. Generally, the fuel is injected
into the intake manifold while the intake
valves are still closed. The end of injection 
is determined by the pre-intake angle, the
reference point of which is the closing of the
intake valve. The pre-intake angle is speci-
fied as a function of the engine operating
point. The start of injection can be calcu-
lated from the injection duration by means
of the engine speed.

Natural-gas injector NGI2

Development
Bosch has been making available an electro-
magnetic natural-gas injector on the CNG
market for many years now. This injector,
bearing the designation EV1.3A, is based on
the gasoline injector and has been adapted
for gas metering with an increased needle
lift and a stronger magnetic circuit. 

Bosch in the meantime has developed a
new generation of gas injectors, bearing the
designation NGI2 (Natural-Gas Injector 2).
The NGI2 shares only its external shape and
electrical actuation with its original source,
the current EV14 gasoline injector for mani-
fold injection. All the functional compo-
nents have been specifically conceived for
use in modern natural-gas vehicles and are
entirely new in terms of design. The know-
how from the EV14 and above all the know -
ledge and experience gained with the previ-
ous EV1.3A gas injector are reflected in the
NGI2’s design. New findings and discoveries
stemming from advance development in 
the related field of components for hydrogen
drives have also played a role. Thus, the
NGI2 brings together a series of technical
innovations which sets new standards in 
the field of gas metering.

Design criteria
The maximum required natural-gas mass
flow through the injectors, based on a de-
fined engine spectrum, is specified for the
development of the injectors. This maxi-
mum required natural-gas mass flow is de-
rived from the inducted air-mass flow of 
the internal-combustion engine, the desired
air/fuel ratio (lambda value) and the gas
quality. The inducted air-mass flow is in
turn dependent on the effective engine
 displacement, on the engine speed, on the
mixture temperature and on the mixture
pressure in the combustion chamber when
the intake valves close.

A high percentage of CNG applications 
in the passenger-car field including turbo -
charged engines can be covered with a maxi-
mum natural-gas mass flow of 7.5 kg/h.

In order to supply the internal-combus-
tion engine with this mass flow of gaseous
fuel, it is necessary to meter through the gas
injectors much more gas in terms of volume
than gasoline in a conventional gasoline
 engine. This requirement places specific
 demands on the design of the gas injector,
which must be adapted to the greater gas
volume in its cross-sections. Even the high
flow velocities that are encountered call for 
a special form of flow routing in order to re-
duce pressure losses ahead of the throttling
point. Configuration for operation above
critical (speed of sound in the narrowest
cross-section) makes it possible even at
higher intake-manifold pressures, such as,
for example, on supercharged engines, to
 deliver a characteristic curve that is not de-
pendent on the intake-manifold pressure.
In highly supercharged engines, the in-
take-manifold pressure can rise up to 2.5 bar
(absolute). In order to suppress the influence
of the intake-manifold pressure on the mass
flow, it is necessary for the admission pres-
sure at the narrowest cross-section accepted
as the nozzle above critical to be at least
twice as high as the maximum intake-mani-
fold pressure. While taking into account pos-
sible pressure losses, this produces a mini-
mum system pressure of 7 bar (absolute).

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Natural-gas injector NGI2

This design quantity forms the basis of 
the NGI2, since all applications are to be
covered with a single design (principle of
 effective action). 

Increasing the mass flow by raising the
admission pressure is basically possible. 
At the same time, however, the opening
force required in the injector increases with
the result that the possible system pressure 
is limited in the upward direction by the re-
stricted magnetic force. The NGI2 has been
optimized for a system pressure of 7 bar
 (absolute) to its maximum mass flow. The
injector can also be configured by simple
modification to higher admission pressures
with an identical mass flow. Even lowering
the system pressure with smaller mass-flow
demands is basically possible.

Design and method of operation
Individual parts and operation
The operating principles of the NGI2 are
similar to those of the EV14 gasoline injec-
tor. The direction of fuel flow (top feed), 
the connections and the form of electrical
actuation are identical. However, the indi-
vidual parts have been adapted for use in 
the natural-gas system.

The solenoid armature (Fig. 6, Pos. 9) is
guided in a sleeve (6). The armature has fuel
flowing through it on the inside and has an
elastomer seal at the discharge end. This seal
closes on the flat seat (10) and thereby seals
off the fuel supply from the intake manifold.
When energized, the solenoid coil (7) effects
the necessary force to lift the solenoid arma-
ture and open the metering cross-section
(throttling point in the valve seat). When the
coil is de-energized, the NGI2 is held closed
by a resetting spring (8).

Size and weight
The outer shape of the NGI2 is the same 
as that of the EV14 gasoline injector. In
comparison with established gas injectors,
the NGI2 is extremely light and compact.
These qualities make it easy to integrate in
existing intake-manifold geometries.

Flow-optimized geometry
With regard to the routing of the flow in the
NGI2, the pressure loss has been minimized
ahead of the throttling point in order to en-
sure the greatest possible mass flow. Further-
more, the narrowest cross-section and thus
the throttling point has been intentionally
situated at the discharge end after the seal.
The speed of sound is obtained here such
that the injector conforms approximately to
the physical description of an ideal nozzle.
The injector is designed for operation above
critical in order to minimize to the greatest
possible extent the influence of the intake-
manifold pressure on the mass flow. Thanks
to a double routing of flow, the layout of the

Natural-gas injector NGI2

129

Solenoid coil
At 12 ohms, the NGI2’s solenoid coil has the
same resistance as the EV14 gasoline injec-
tor. Whereas, previously, complicated actua-
tion arrangements, such as parallel-switched
output stages or peak-and-hold control,
were used to operate low-resistance gas in-
jectors, a standard switching output stage
can be used with the NGI2.

Variable oil content
Natural gas is becoming increasingly more
widespread as a fuel and the number of nat-
ural-gas filling stations is growing constantly
in Europe. Especially newer filling stations
are equipped with modern compressors
which inject less oil into the compressed gas
than older compressor types. In future,
therefore, it can no longer be assumed that
natural gas will have a lubricating and thus
wear-reducing effect in the injector.
A solid-lubricant layer on the surface of the
solenoid armature ensures that the NGI2 
is able to cope with variable oil content in
natural gas right down to the detection limit
with minimal wear.

valve seat allows a large cross-section to
open with relatively low opening force.

Variant range
The NGI2 is available in different lengths
and with different plug connectors. Further-
more, variants have been developed for dif-
ferent system pressures and with different
flow rates. Thus, as is the case with gasoline
injectors, a range of variants is available for
different engines.

Sealing geometry
The NGI2 is fitted with an elastomer seal
and is similar in terms of its seal-seat geom-
etry to shutoff valves for pneumatic applica-
tions. Thus, the NGI2 leaks much less than
the EV1.3A. Damping in the elastomer also
prevents “rebounding”, i.e., a repeated, un-
wanted opening of the solenoid armature
during the closing operation, and thus in-
creases metering precision.

Noise
The optimized routing of flow greatly
 reduces the armature stroke. This in turn
 reduces the speed of the solenoid armature
as it reaches its stops. When combined with
the damping properties of the elastomer seal
in the seat stop, the NGI2 has an overall
sound-pressure level which is 2 dB lower
than its predecessor.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

Natural-gas rail, combined natural-gas pressure and temperature sensor

The injectors are held in place with retain-

etched-in pressure diaphragm (8)

Natural-gas rail

The function of the rail is to supply the 
gas injectors with natural gas in uniform
quantities and with minimal pulsations. 
It is made from stainless steel or aluminum.
Design and construction (volume, dimen-
sions, weight, etc.) are engine- and system-
specific. The gas is usually supplied to the
rail via a flexible low-pressure line.

The rail has a screwed connection,

through which it is supplied with gas in the
middle or from the side (low-pressure side
of the fuel-supply system). 

ing clips in the injector receptacles on the
rail. The rail is provided optionally with an
attachment point at which a gas pressure
and temperature sensor can be attached 
to the rail. 

Combined natural-gas
 pressure and temperature
sensor
Function
Monolithic silicon pressure sensors are high-
precision measuring elements for determin-
ing absolute pressure. They are particularly
suitable for use under rough ambient condi-
tions, such as, for example, for measuring

the absolute natural-gas pressure in the rail
of CNG-powered vehicles. 

The combined low-pressure/temperature

sensor (DS-K-TF) measures pressure and
temperature in the natural-gas rail and
 controls exact gas metering by means of 
the ECU.

Design and method of operation
The sensor consists of the following main
components:
(cid:2) Plug housing (Fig. 8, Pos. 1) with electri-

cal connection (6)

(cid:2) Sensor cell (2) with silicon chip (9) and

(cid:2) NTC sensor element (5)
(cid:2) Fitting (4)
(cid:2) Outer O-ring (3)

A change in the gas pressure causes the sili-
con-chip pressure diaphragm to elongate;
this elongation is recorded by way of
changes in resistance by resistors situated on
the silicon chip. The evaluator circuit is like-
wise integrated together with the electronic
compensating elements on the silicon chip.

The silicon chip with glass base is soldered
to a metal base with the pressure connecting
tube (10). The gas pressure (CNG) is routed
through this tube to the lower side of the
pressure diaphragm. Underneath the cap (7)
welded to the metal base is a reference

 vacuum (11), which enables the absolute
pressure to be measured and simultaneously
protects the upper side (circuit side) of the
chip diaphragm against harmful environ-
mental influences. The finish-compensated
sensor cell is mounted in a plug housing
with an electrical connection.

The sensor incorporates an NTC sensor
element for recording the gas temperature.
The fitting is glued tightly onto the plug
housing. 

The sensor is sealed, for example from the

gas rail, by a natural-gas-resistant O-ring.

Signal evaluation
The combined low-pressure/temperature
sensor delivers an analog pressure output
signal which is ratiometric to the supply
voltage. An RC low-pass filter in the input
section of the subsequent electronic cir-
cuitry ensures that potentially disruptive
harmonic waves are suppressed.

The integrated temperature sensor con-
sists of an NTC thermistor and must be op-
erated with a corresponding series resistor 
as a voltage divider.

DS-HD-KV4 high-pressure
sensor

Function
The high-pressure sensor in natural-gas-
powered spark-ignition engines is integrated
in the pressure-regulator module. Its func-
tion is to measure the pressure of the natural
gas in the tank.

Design and method of operation
The core of the sensor is a steel diaphragm,
which is welded tight on a threaded fitting
(Fig. 9). The sensor is mounted in the pres-
sure-regulator module by means of the
thread. Strain gages are integrated in a
bridge circuit on the upper side of the 
steel diaphragm. 

When pressure is applied, the steel dia -
phragm elongates and the bridge circuit 
is detuned. The resulting bridge voltage is
proportional to the applied pressure. It is
 directed via bonded wires to the evaluator
circuit, amplified and converted into an out-
put voltage of 0.5 V...4.5 V. From this signal,
the engine ECU calculates the current tank
pressure using a characteristic curve.

Operation of gasoline engines on natural gas

TV-NG1 tank shutoff valve

TV-NG1 tank shutoff valve

Function
The TV-NG1 tank shutoff valve is screwed
directly into the natural-gas tank and serves
as the interface to the fuel system in the
 vehicle. The function of the TV-NG1 is to
open up and shut off the gas flow. A sole-
noid shutoff valve (SOV-NG1) is integrated
in the TV-NG1 for this purpose. 

In addition, various service and safety

 devices are mounted on the TV-NG1: 
(cid:2) The gas flow can be interrupted for re-
pairs with a mechanical shutoff valve. 
(cid:2) A flow limiter ensures that the contents of
the tank are drained under throttled con-
ditions if the natural-gas high-pressure
line is severed in the event of an accident. 

(cid:2) A fusible link provides protection in the

event of fire. At a temperature of approxi-
mately 110 °C, the fuse blows and ensures
that the contents of the tank are discharged
under controlled conditions to atmosphere. 
(cid:2) A pressure-limiting valve or a temperature
sensor can also be optionally installed. 
(cid:2) It is possible with the aid of the optional
temperature sensor to measure the tank
contents more precisely when compared
with pure pressure measurement.

10

TV-NG1 tank shutoff valve

1

Design
Two different types of tank shutoff valve
may be used: internal and external. On an
external tank shutoff valve, the individual
attachment parts are mounted outside the
gas bottle, as on a conventional gas fitting.
On an internal tank shutoff valve, all the
 devices are integrated in the valve block and
project into the gas tank. From the outside,
only a plate containing the connections can
be seen. This design provides for enhanced
crash safety when compared with an exter-
nal tank shutoff valve, and at the same time
the reduced height makes it possible to use
longer tanks and thereby optimize the tank
volume. 

Method of operation
Fig. 10 shows the external TV-NG1, consist-
ing of the valve block and the SOV-NG1
modular shutoff valve (2). The SOV-NG1 is
a two-stage solenoid valve for shutting off
natural gas and is closed when de-energized.
The closing process is initiated after the cur-
rent is deactivated by a spring, which forces
the sealing element onto the seal seat. The
valve is also held closed with the assistance
of the system pressure. 

The SOV-NG1 operates according to a
two-stage opening principle, i.e., pressure
equalization is established in the first open-
ing stage (small cross-section) and only then
is the full throughflow cross-section opened.
From a system point of view, a peak-hold
actuation proves to be effective. In this case,
after actuation, the valve switches back with
a high opening current to a lower holding
current in order to reduce electrical power
loss. However, the valve can also be perma-
nently operated with the opening current. 
A trapezoidal plug serves as the electrical
 interface.

PR-NG1 pressure-regulator module

133

PR-NG1 pressure-regulator
module

Function
The function of the PR-NG1 pressure-regu-
lator module is to reduce the pressure of the
natural gas from tank pressure to the nomi-
nal operating pressure. At the same time, the
operating pressure must be kept constant
within specific tolerances through all oper-
ating states. The operating pressure of pre-
sent-day systems is usually about 7...9 bar
(absolute). There are also systems which
 operate at pressures starting from 2 bar
ranging up to 11 bar.

Design
Today, mainly diaphragm- or plunger-type
pressure regulators are used. Pressure reduc-
tion is effected by means of throttle action
and can occur either in one single stage or 
in several stages. 

11

PR-NG1 pressure-regulator module

Figure 11 shows the sectional view of a sin-
gle-stage diaphragm-type pressure regulator. 
A 40 μm sinter filter, a shutoff valve 
(SOV-NG1), and a high-pressure sensor 
are provided on the high-pressure side. 
The sinter filter is designed to retain solid
particulates in the gas flow, while the 
SOV-NG1 serves to shut off the gas flow. 
A pressure sensor is incorporated to deter-
mine the fuel level in the tank. 

A pressure-relief valve is mounted on the
pressure regulator on the low-pressure side.
In the event of a fault in the pressure regula-
tor, this pressure-relief valve prevents dam-
age to components in the low-pressure sys-
tem. When the gas expands, the PR-NG1
cools down sharply in accordance with the
Joule-Thompson effect. The PR-NG1 is
therefore connected to the vehicle’s heating
circuit to prevent it from freezing up. 

The operating pressure is preset by select-
ing the appropriate types of diaphragm and

compression spring.
An adjusting screw
which is preset and
sealed at the factory 
is used for fine adjust-
ment of the spring
preload.

Method of operation
The gas flows from 
the high-pressure side
through a variable
throttling orifice (5)
into the low-pressure
chamber (9), where
the diaphragm (8) 
is situated. The dia -
phragm controls the
opening cross-section
of the throttling 
orifice (5) via a con-
trol rod (6). When the
pressure in the low-
pressure chamber is
low, the  diaphragm 
is forced by the

by a buildup of noise and wear. In the inter-
ests of minimizing this, pressure regulators
are normally designed in such a way that the
lock-off pressure is so far above the system
pressure that the throttling orifice always
 remains open in normal operation.

An ideal pressure regulator keeps the pres-
sure constant, regardless of the throughflow.
In reality, however, pressure regulators devi-
ate from this ideal behavior on account 
of side effects. Figure 12 depicts a typical
throughflow curve for a single-stage pres-
sure regulator. The output pressure drops 
as throughflow increases, and hysteresis is
also encountered between increasing and
decreasing throughflow. This hysteresis
arises on account of frictional and flow
losses. Basically, the effects shown occur
most clearly when the throughflow is high
and the pressure regulator has a compact
 design.

 direction of the throttling orifice, which
opens to allow the pressure to increase on
the low-pressure side. In the event of exces-
sive pressure in the low-pressure chamber,
the spring is compressed more sharply and
the throttling orifice closes. The decreasing
cross-section of the throttling orifice reduces
the pressure on the low-pressure side. In sta-
tionary operation, the system levels out at a
specific throttle opening and keeps the pres-
sure in the low-pressure chamber constant.
If now the gas demand in the system in-
creases, e.g., when the accelerator pedal is
pressed, at first more gas is discharged from
the pressure regulator than can follow up
through the throttling orifice. As a result, 
the pressure in the low-pressure area drops
briefly until the throttling orifice opens to
such an extent as to re-establish a constant
pressure for the increased throughflow.
 Minimal system-pressure fluctuations in the
event of load changes testify to the quality of
the pressure regulator.

When the pressure in the low-pressure
chamber exceeds a specific value, e.g., be-
cause no gas is discharged into the system,
the throttling orifice closes completely. This
pressure is known as the lock-off pressure.
The throttling orifice reopens when the
pressure drops. The process of the throttling
orifice opening and closing is accompanied

Real-world fuel economy

Manufacturers must furnish fuel-con-
sumption data for their vehicles. The offi-
cial figures are calculated based on the
composition of the exhaust gases moni-
tored during emissions testing. Emis-
sions testing is conducted based on a
standardised test procedure, or driving
cycle. The standardized procedure pro-
vides emissions figures suitable for com-
parison among vehicles. 

Motorists can make a major contribu-
tion to improved fuel economy by adopt-
ing a suitable driving style. Potential fuel
savings vary according to a variety of
factors. 

By adopting the practices listed below,
the “economy-minded” motorist can
achieve fuel savings of 20...30 % com-
pared to the “average” driver. The lati-
tude available for enhancing fuel econ-
omy depends upon a number of factors.
Especially significant among these are
operating environment (urban traffic or
long-distance cruising, etc.) and gen-
eral traffic conditions. This is why at-
tempts to quantify the precise savings
potential represented by each individual
factor are not always logical.

Increasing fuel economy

(cid:2) Accelerate at wide throttle openings and low engine speeds, upshift at 2000 rpm
(cid:2) Drive in the highest possible gear: even at engine speeds below 2000 rpm it is possible

Ignition systems over the years

Overview

Ignition systems over the years

The gasoline, or spark-ignition, engine is an
internal-combustion machine that relies on
an external source of ignition-energy to run.
An ignition spark ignites the air/fuel mix-
ture compressed in the combustion chamber
to initiate the combustion process. This igni-
tion spark is generated by a flashover be-
tween the electrodes of a spark plug extend-
ing into the combustion chamber. The igni-
tion system must generate adequate levels 
of high-voltage energy to generate the flash -
over at the spark plug while also ensuring
that the ignition spark is triggered at pre-
cisely the right instant.

Overview

Development history of Bosch 
ignition systems
Magneto
Ignition in gasoline engines posed a big
problem in the early years of the automobile.
It was only when Robert Bosch developed
the low-voltage magneto that an ignition
 system became available which was deemed
sufficiently reliable for the conditions obtain-
ing at the time. The magneto generated by
means of magnetic induction in a wound
 armature an ignition current which, when
interrupted, triggered an ignition spark at
the arcing mechanism. This spark was able 
to ignite the mixture in the combustion

chamber. However, the limits of this tech -
nology were soon to become apparent.

High-voltage magneto ignition was able
to satisfy the demands of faster-running en-
gines. This magneto also generated a voltage
by means of magnetic induction. This volt-
age was transformed to such an extent that 
it was able to trigger a flashover at the elec-
trodes of the spark plug which was now in
common use.

Battery ignition
The demand for more cost-efficient ignition
system led to the development of battery
 ignition; this gave rise to conventional coil
ignition with a battery serving as the sup-
plier of energy and an ignition coil serving as
the energy storage medium (Fig. 2). The coil
current was switched via the breaker point. 
A mechanical governor and a vacuum unit
served to adjust the ignition angle.

Development did not stop there. Elec-
tronic components began to be used and
gradually the amount of electronic compo-
nents increased. First of all, with transistor-
ized ignition, the coil current was switched
via a transistor in order to prevent contact
erosion at the breaker points and thereby to
reduce wear. In further transistorized igni-
tion variants, the breaker contact, which still
served as the control element for activating
the ignition coil, was replaced. This function
was now taken over by Hall generators or
 induction-type pulse generators. 

The next step was electronic ignition. 
The load- and speed-dependent ignition
 angle was now stored in a program map in
the ECU. Now it was possible to take into
account further parameters, such as, for
 example, the engine temperature, for deter-
mining the ignition angle. In the final step,
with the arrival of distributorless semicon-
ductor ignition, even the mechanical
 distributor has now been dispensed with.

Figure 1 shows this development process.

Since 1998 only Motronic systems, which
have integrated the functionality of distrib -
utorless semiconductor ignition in the en-
gine-management systems, have been used.

Ignition systems over the years

Early ignition evolution

The Volta pistol
 combined two basic
 elements of engine
 technology: It used a
mixture of air and gas,
and relied on an electri-
cal spark. It is here that
the story of electric
 ignition begins.

Early ignition evolution

Long before the first engines appeared at 
the end of the 19th century, inventors were
engaged in efforts to evolve internal-com-
bustion machines suitable for replacing the
steam engines which were widely used at 
the time. 

The first known attempt to create a
 thermal-energy machine to replace boiler,
burner and steam with internal combustion
was undertaken by Christiaan Huygens in
the year 1673. The fuel used in this powder
machine (Fig. 1) was gunpowder (1), which
was ignited with a fuse (2). Following igni-
tion, the combustion gases escape through
non-return valves (4) from the tube (3), 
in which a vacuum is then created. Atmo -
spheric pressure forces the piston (5) down-
wards, and a weight G (7) is lifted. 

Because the machine had to be reloaded

after each ignition, it could not serve as a
true engine by providing continuous power. 
Over 100 years later, in 1777, Alessandro
Volta experimented with igniting a mixture
of air and marsh gas using sparks. Spark
generation was provided by the electro -
phorous tube which he had invented in
1775. This effect was utilized in the 
Volta pistol.

In 1807 Isaak de Rivaz developed an atmo -
spheric piston engine, in which he utilized
the principle of Volta’s gas pistol and ignited
a combustible air/gas mixture with an elec-
trical spark. Rivaz built an experimental ve-
hicle (Fig. 2) based on his patent drawings,
but soon abandoned his efforts in response
to less than satisfactory results. Working
along similar lines to Huygens’ powder ma-
chine, a piston was blasted upwards by the
explosion before being pulled back again by
atmospheric pressure. The vehicle was thus
able to move forward a few meters, but then
fresh combustion mixture had to be admit-
ted into the cylinder and ignited.

Mobile applications in a motor vehicle
called for engines with continuous outgoing
power. Igniting the combustible mixture in
the cylinder proved to be the main problem
here. Many engine builders were working on
finding solutions, and various systems came
into being at the same time.

High-voltage vibrator ignition
A concept for a battery-based ignition sys-
tem had been available since 1860, when 
the Frenchman Etienne Lenoir constructed 
a “high-voltage vibrator ignition” system
(Fig. 3) for his stationary gas engine. To
 generate the ignition current, a Ruhmkorff
spark inductor (2) was used, which was sup-
plied, for example, by a galvanic element

(voltaic pile) (battery ignition). Two insu-
lated platinum wires (6) served as the elec-
trodes to generate the flashover in the en-
gine. Lenoir had thus invented the precursor
of all spark plugs. Lenoir used a high-voltage
distributor on contact rails (5) to control
current flow to the two spark plugs on the
dual-action engine.

In the Ruhmkorff spark inductor, a mag-
netic field builds up in the coil as soon as the
circuit is completed. The current increases
gradually. When it has reached a specific
value, the armature (4) is attracted and the
trembler contacts (3) open. The magnetic
field collapses as a result of the broken cir-
cuit. The rapid magnetic-field change in-
duces in the second coil a high induction
voltage, which causes a flashover at the spark
plug. The armature completes the circuit
again and the process is repeated. Approxi-
mately 40 to 50 ignition processes were
achieved with this high-tension vibrator ig-
nition. The vibrator system emitted a char-
acteristic buzzing sound during operation. 
The following factors prevented this sys-
tem from achieving widespread popularity
in automotive applications.
(cid:2) The system actually generated an entire
series of sparks during the combustion
stroke, which prevented efficient combus-
tion at higher engine speeds.

3

Lenoir high-voltage vibrator ignition

(cid:2) No option was available at the time for

generating the required current while the
vehicle was actually moving.

In 1886 Carl Benz further developed high-
voltage vibrator ignition and was thereby
able to achieve higher speeds than with his
first vehicle engine (approximately 250 rpm).
The electrical power source continued to
pose problems, as the galvanic elements re-
sponsible for supplying current were ready
for replacement after only 10 kilometers.

Hot-tube ignition
Increases in engine operating speeds were
essential if the size of powerful gasoline en-
gines for automotive applications was to 
be kept in check. Unfortunately, the control
mechanisms employed for flame ignition, 
as were commonly used in stationary gas
 engines, were too slow to achieve higher
speeds.

In 1883 the continuous-operation, hot-
tube ignition system developed by Gottlieb
Daimler was patented. This ignition system
(Fig. 4) consisted of a passage which was
connected to the combustion chamber in
the cylinder. The passage was sealed gas-
tight by a hot tube (2) which was perma-
nently made to glow by a burner. During 
the compression stroke, the mixture was
forced into the hot tube, where it ignited

Ignition was – as Carl
Benz once observed –
“the problem to end all
problems”. 
“If there is no spark, 
then everything else has
been in vain, and the
most brilliant design 
is worthless”.

It was not without reason
that French drivers at 
the turn of the century
bade each other not
“Safe journey!” but 
“Safe ignition!” 
(“Bon Allumage!”).

and induced the remaining mixture in the
combustion chamber to ignite. The hot tube 
had to be heated in such a way that ignition
started only at the end of the compression
stroke. 

Hot-tube ignition enable engine speed to be
increased dramatically. Depending on the sys-
tem design, speeds as high as 700...900rpm
were possible. 

For more than a decade, hot-tube ignition

was the predominant type of ignition used
by many engine manufacturers. The concept
fostered widespread acceptance of both the
Daimler engine and the motor vehicle in
general. One disadvantage, however, lay in
the fact that the hot tube always had to be
adjusted to the correct heat. Furthermore,
the flame was prone to go out in rainy or
stormy conditions. If the burner was inex-
pertly handled, fire damage was a distinct
possibility, which compelled the design engi-
neer Wilhelm Maybach in 1897 to hypothe-
size in a memorandum that every automo-
bile with hot-tube ignition would sooner 
or later be destroyed by fire. Even Daimler in
the end turned to the principle of magneto
ignition after this form of ignition had in
the meantime proved to be workable.

Magneto-electric low-voltage 
snap-release ignition
In 1884 Nikolaus August Otto developed
magneto-electric low-voltage snap-release
ignition. A magneto-inductor with an oscil-
lating double-T armature and rod-shaped
permanent magnet generated a low-voltage
ignition current (Fig. 5). Interrupting the
current flow produced an opening ignition
spark at the contact points in the cylinder.
The armature drive’s spring-loaded snap-
 release mechanism and the push rod con-
trolling the ignition contact’s trip lever were
coordinated to open the circuit at precisely
the instant when armature current peaked.
This produced a powerful ignition spark at
the moment of ignition.

The four-stroke engine developed by Otto

in 1876 had up to that point been powered
by municipal gas and had therefore only
been suitable for stationary applications.
Magneto-electric low-voltage snap-release
ignition now allowed such an engine to be
powered by gasoline. However, the engine
speeds that could be achieved limited its use
to slow-running, stationary engines only. 

Magneto ignition
The ignition problem called out for a solu-
tion which would be more suitable for mo-
tor vehicles. In the end, this problem was
 addressed by a special company which did
not build engines itself, but rather brought
onto the market ignition devices for slow-
running engines: This was Robert Bosch’s
Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Elek-
trotechnik (Workshops for Light and Elec-
trical Engineering), founded in 1886 in
Stuttgart.

Bosch low-voltage magneto with 
snap-release mechanism
Bosch developed magneto-electric low-volt-
age devices for Otto’s snap-release ignition
(Fig. 5) in order to be able to offer them as
accessory equipment to the manufacturers
of stationary spark-ignition engines. 
The system’s asset was its ability to operate
without a battery. The high weight of the

 armature and the slow ignition mechanism
prevented its continued use in automotive
engines. 

Low-voltage magneto ignition
Bosch developed the slow snap-release igni-
tion into faster and lighter make-and-break
magneto ignition suitable for high-speed
 automotive engines. 

Instead of allowing the heavy, wound
 armature to oscillate, the system now used 
a sleeve suspended between the pole shoes
and the fixed armature (Fig. 6) to act as a
conductor of the lines of flux. The sleeve was
driven via bevel gears, which also served to
adjust the moment of ignition. A cam rising
slowly in the direction of rotation served to
rotate the arcing mechanism. As soon as the
mechanism sped through spring force away
from the cam, the ignition lever was sepa-
rated from the ignition pin in the cylinder,
and the ignition spark was thereby gener-
ated.

The sleeve design of the magneto and the
bevel-gear drive were immediately successful
because this arrangement proved to be suit-
able for the speed range required at the time.

Daimler had one of these ignition systems
installed in a vehicle in 1898, and then
 proceeded to road-test it by driving from
Stuttgart to Tyrol, a trial which passed off
successfully. Even the Daimler engine of the
first Zeppelin airship operated with a Bosch
make-and-break ignition system, since the
flammability of the filling gas precluded the
use of hot-tube ignition in the airship.

However, this ignition system was still a
low-voltage magneto system, which required
mechanically and later electromagnetically
controlled arcing contacts in the combus-
tion chamber to generate the opening igni-
tion sparks via an arcing mechanism.

High-voltage magneto ignition
Higher engine speeds, compression ratios
and combustion temperatures all combined
to produce ignition demands that make-
and-break ignition could not satisfy. Until
problems with batteries could be resolved,
magneto ignition using spark plugs instead
of arcing contacts represented the only
 viable option. A source of high-voltage igni-
tion current was essential for this purpose.

Ignition systems over the years

Early ignition evolution

Robert Bosch assigned Gottlob Honold
to design a magneto-based ignition system
in which the arcing mechanism would be
 replaced by permanent ignition electrodes. 
Honold’s starting point was a low-voltage
magneto with an oscillating sleeve, which he
then proceeded to modify. The double-T ar-
mature received two windings; one consisted
of a limited number of loops of thick wire,
while the second comprised a larger number
of loops of thin wire (Fig. 7). Rotating the
sleeve generated initially generated a low
voltage in the armature winding. The wind-
ing with the fewer number of loops was si-
multaneously shorted by a contact breaker
(10). This produced a high current which
was subsequently interrupted. This induced
in the other winding with the larger number
of loops a high, rapidly decaying voltage,
which passed through the spark gap at the
spark plug (16) to render it conductive. 
After this, a further voltage was induced in
the same winding. Although substantially
lower than the first voltage, it was sufficient
to send a current through the now conduc-
tive spark gap and generate an arc familiar
from make-and-break ignition.

7

The contact breaker was mechanically con-
trolled by a cam (15) to enable it to com-
plete or break the circuit of the low-voltage
winding at a precisely defined time. A con-
denser was connected in parallel with the
breaker points to inhibit arcing at the con-
tact breaker.

The spark plugs also had to be redevel-

oped, since their electrodes eroded too
quickly because of the hot, arc-like sparking
by the new magneto. The development of
Bosch spark plugs also dates back to this pe-
riod. Contact breakers, which right from the
start formed the heart of the high-voltage
magneto, were developed further to make
them more operationally reliable. 

Yet another version of magneto ignition was
developed by Ernst Eisemann. This system’s
high voltage was generated by a separate
transformer fed by a low-voltage magneto.
Initially, the winding of this magneto was
shorted repeatedly during each current wave
by a contactor which rotated synchronously
with the armature. Later, Eisemann identi-
fied that just one short was sufficient. 
In Germany, Eisemann met with rejection.
However, he enjoyed success in France,

where the engineer de la Valette secured the
exclusive-marketing rights for Eisemann’s
magneto ignition. Later, Eisemann aban-
doned the separate coil in favor of the Bosch
design featuring the familiar double-T
 armature with its two windings. 

Battery ignition
When Robert Bosch AG introduced battery
ignition in 1925, the automotive industry
was dominated by magneto ignition, be-
cause it was the most reliable form of igni-
tion. But vehicle manufacturers were de-
manding a less expensive system. After be-
coming established in series production in
the US, battery ignition started to take hold
on both motor cars and motorcycles within
a few years in Europe too.

First series production in the US
By 1908 the American Charles F. Kettering
had improved battery ignition to the point
where it was ready for series production at
Cadillac in 1910. Despite all its imperfec-
tions, it became increasingly popular during
the First World War. The desire of the gen-
eral population for affordable motor vehi-
cles encouraged the success of the cheaper
battery-ignition system. The vehicle’s depen-
dence on a battery came to be accepted be-
cause battery charging was now taken care
of during vehicle operation by the installa-
tion of an alternator.

European introduction of battery ignition
by Bosch
In the initial years following World War I in
Europe, motor cars were restricted to a small
segment of the population, but the gradual
rise in the demand for cars was accompa-
nied by a desire for less expensive products,
just as it had earlier in the US. In the 1920s
conditions were ripe in Europe for the wide-
spread breakthrough of battery-ignition
 systems. Bosch had long been in possession
of the expertise required to design such a
system for series production. Before 1914
Bosch was already supplying ignition coils –
the core of a battery-ignition system – to the
US market. Bosch was one of the first manu-
facturers to respond and in 1925 brought
onto the European market a battery-ignition
system, consisting of an ignition coil and an
ignition distributor. Initially, they were only
used in the Brennabor 4/25. But, by 1931, 
46 of the 55 automotive models available in
Germany were equipped with the system.

Design and method of operation 
Battery ignition consisted of two separate
devices: the engine-driven ignition distribu-
tor and the ignition coil (Fig. 8). The igni-
tion coil (7) contained the primary and sec-
ondary windings, and the iron core. The dis-
tributor (8) comprised the stationary con-
tact breaker (5), the rotating actuator cam
(4), and a mechanism to distribute the sec-
ondary current. The ignition condenser (3)
protected the points against premature wear
by suppressing arcing.

The only moving parts in the system were
the contact-breaker cam and the distributor
shaft. The system also contrasted with mag-
neto-based systems by requiring only negli-
gible levels of motive force to sustain its
 operation. 

Another difference relative to the magneto

was that battery ignition obtained its pri-
mary current from the vehicle’s electrical
system. The high voltage was generated in 
a similar way to the magneto: the current,
which built up a magnetic field in the
 primary winding, was interrupted by

Ignition systems over the years

Early ignition evolution

engine speed, found as early as 1910 in high-
voltage magneto-ignition systems, were
adopted in battery-ignition systems. 

Fuel economy also became a progressively

more important consideration, making it
necessary to include the dependence on load
of the combustion process in the timing
 adjustment. The answer was to install a dia -
phragm that responded to the intake-mani-
fold pressure upstream from the throttle
valve plate and generated actuating forces 
on the ignition distributor. This resulted in
an ignition-angle correct acting in addition
to the centrifugal timing adjuster. Bosch in-
troduced this vacuum-controlled timing in
its ignition distributors in 1936.

In developing the breaker points, Bosch
was able to draw on experience already gar-
nered while working with magnetos. All of
battery-ignition components underwent im-
provement over the course of time. Eventu-
ally, technological advances – especially in
the new field of semiconductor technology –
paved the way for new ignition systems.
While the basic concept mirrored that of the
original battery-ignition system, the designs
were radically different.

a  mechanically controlled contact breaker.
The collapse of the magnetic field generated
high voltage in the secondary winding.

Ignition-performance demands for 
“modern times”
The performance demands placed on igni-
tion systems for internal-combustion en-
gines increased dramatically and became
more varied. Engines were operated with
higher compression and leaner air/fuel mix-
tures. Even the maximum speed was in-
creased. At the same time, demands, such 
as e.g., low noise, good idle performance,
long service intervals, low weight, small di-
mensions, and low price, made rapid further
development essential.

Higher compression ratios combined with

more economical carburetor tuning meant
that higher ignition voltages were needed to
ensure safe and reliable flashover triggering.
Meanwhile, wider spark-plug electrode gaps
were required for smooth idling, and this
also raised additional demands for ignition
voltage. Voltage levels had to rise to more
than twice their earlier level. This, in turn,
had implications for the conductive ele-
ments in the high-voltage circuit, which  
had to be designed to resist arcing.

Also required was a way to adjust ignition

timing to accommodate the expanded en-
gine-speed range. Ignition timing had to ad-
justed through a larger range to compensate
for the increased lag between firing point
and flame-front propagation encountered 
at high engine speeds. In systems developed
for multi-cylinder engines, the primary-cur-
rent circuit breaker and the mechanism for
distributing the high voltage supplied by the
 ignition coil were integrated in a single dis-
tributor housing, where they shared a com-
mon drive shaft. Ignition timing was regu-
lated by shifting the position of the contact-
breaker lever relative to the cam, an exercise
initially performed from the driver’s seat,
and requiring both experience and some de-
gree of mechanical sensitivity. Centrifugal

Bosch low-tension magneto ignition systems successfully
absolved the acid test in the first car with the name
 Mercedes, which won three French races as well as achiev-
ing other  victories in the course of 1901. One particularly
significant event was the Irish Gorden Bennett race in
1903. With the Belgian driver Camille Jenatzy at the helm,
the 60 HP  Mercedes posted an impressive triumph – a 
success to which the reliability and superior performance 
of Bosch magneto ignition made a major contribution. 
By the time the 1904 Gorden Bennett rolled around, the
five fastest cars were all equipped with Bosch ignition. 
In June of 1902 a “light touring car” from Renault was
the first to reach Vienna’s Trabrennplatz at the culmination
of the Paris to Vienna long-distance race. At the wheel was
Marcel Renault, whose brother had already attracted con-
siderable attention while at the same time laying the foun-
dation for a major automotive marque with his “voiturette” in 1898. Renault’s winning car was
equipped with the new Bosch high-tension magneto ignition, an innovation still not available on
standard vehicles at the time.

a Bosch advertising poster from 1911

In 1906, victory at the French Grand Prix also went to a vehicle equipped with the Bosch high-

 tension magneto system. This system soon found favored status as the system of choice among
automotive manufacturers, resulting in a massive sales increase.

Magneto ignition in aircraft

It was in May, 1927, that postal aviator Charles Lindbergh embarked upon his historic flight
across the Atlantic. His single-engine “Spirit of St. Louis” made the non-stop trip from New York
to Paris in 33.5 hours. Trouble-free ignition during the journey was furnished by a magneto manu-
factured by Scintilla in Solothurn, Switzerland, now a member of the Bosch group.

In April, 1928, aviation pioneers Hermann Köhl, Günther Freiherr von Hünefeld and James
 Fitzmaurice achieved the first non-stop airborne traversal of the Atlantic from East to West in a

Junkers W33 featuring a fuselage
of corrugated sheet metal. They
took off from Ireland and landed 
36 hours later in Greenly  Island,
Canada. They were unable to reach
their original objective, New York,
owing to violent weather. But: “the
flight was successful with Bosch
spark plugs and a Bosch magneto”
(see illustration).

Battery ignition  systems 
over the years

The period between the appearance of Bosch
battery ignition in 1925 and the final versions
of this system many years later was marked by
constant change and continuous evolution. 
There were no substantive changes in the
basic concept behind battery ignition in this
time. Most of the modifications focused on the
mechanisms employed to adjust ignition tim-
ing. These were reflected in the changes to sys-
tem components. Ultimately the only compo-
nents remaining from the original battery 
ignition were the coil and the spark plug. 
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, control of 
ignition functions was incorporated in 
the Motronic engine-management system.
Thus ignition systems with separate ignition
control units – as described in the following
 section – are now history.

Conventional coil ignition (CI)
Conventional coil-ignition systems are con-
trolled by contact-breaker points. The contact
breakers in the distributor open and close 
the circuit to control current flow within the
ignition coil. The contact is closed over a 
specific angle (dwell angle).

Design and operation
The components in the conventional 
coil- ignition system (Fig. 1) are the
(cid:2) Ignition coil (3)
(cid:2) Ignition distributor (4) with breaker points
(6),  ignition capacitor (5),  centrifugal and
vacuum advance  mechanisms (7) and the

(cid:2) Spark plugs (9)

During operation battery voltage flows
through the ignition switch (2) on its way to
the coil’s Terminal 15. When the points close,
current flows through the ignition coil’s pri-
mary winding (asphalt coil, refer to section on
ignition coils) and to ground. This flow pro-
duces a magnetic flux field in which ignition
energy is stored. The rise in current flow is
gradual owing to inductance and primary 
resistance in the primary winding. The time
available for charging is determined by the
dwell angle. The dwell angle, in turn, is de-
fined by the contours of the distributor-cam

lobes, which open and close 
the breaker points by pushing
against the cam follower
(Fig. 2b). At the end of the dwell
period the cam lobe opens the
contacts to interrupt current
flow in the coil. The number of
lobes on the cam corresponds to
the number of cylinders in the
engine.

Points must be replaced at
regular intervals owing to wear
on the cam follower as well as
burning and pitting on the con-
tact surfaces.

Current, dwell time and the number of sec-
ondary windings in the coil are the primary
determinants of the ignition voltage induced
in the coil’s secondary circuit. 

A capacitor in parallel with the points pre-

vents arcing between the contact surfaces,
which would allow current to continue flow-
ing after they open. 

The high-tension voltage induced in the ig-
nition coil’s secondary winding is conducted
to the distributor’s centre contact. 
As the rotor (Fig. 1, Pos. 8) turns it establishes
an electrical path between this center contact
and one of the peripheral electrodes. The 
current flows through each electrode in 
sequence, conducting high voltage to the
cylinder that is currently approaching the end
of its compression stroke to generate an arc at
the spark plug. The distributor must remain
synchronized with the crankshaft for its
 operation to remain in rhythm with the
 pistons in the individual cylinders. Synchro-
nization is assured by a positive mechanical
link between the distributor and either the
camshaft or another shaft coupled to the
crankshaft at a 2:1 step-down ratio. 

Ignition advance adjustment
Because of the positive mechanical coupling
between distributor shaft and crankshaft, 
it is possible to adjust the ignition timing 
to the specified angle by rotating the dis -
tributor housing.

Centrifugal advance adjustment
The centrifugal advance mechanism varies 
ignition timing in response to shifts in 
engine speed. Flyweights (Fig. 2a, Pos. 4) are
mounted in a support plate (1) that rotates
with the distributor shaft. These flyweights
spin outward as engine and shaft speed in-
crease. They shift the base plate (5) along 
the contact path (3) to turn it opposite the
distributor shaft’s (6) direction of rotation.
This shifts the relative positions of the point
assembly and distributor cam by the adjust-
ment angle α. Ignition timing is advanced by
this increment.

Vacuum advance adjustment
The vacuum-advance mechanism adjusts
 ignition timing in response to variations in the
engine’s load factor. The index of load factor is
manifold vacuum, which is relayed via hose to
the two aneroid capsules (Fig. 2b). 

Falling load factors are accompanied by
higher vacuum levels in the advance unit
which pull the diaphragm (11) and its ad-
vance/retard arm (16) to the right. In doing
so, the arm turns the breaker-point assembly’s
base plate (8) in the opposite direction to that
of the distributor shaft’s rotation and thus in-
creases the ignition advance. 

Vacuum in the retard unit, for which the
manifold vacuum connection is behind the
throttle plate instead of in front of it, moves
the annular diaphragm (15) and its advance/
retard arm to the left to retard the timing.
This spark retardation system is used to
 improve engine emissions under certain
 operating conditions (idle, trailing throttle,
etc.). The vacuum advance is the priority 
system.

Breaker-triggered transistorized ignition
Design and method of operation
The distributors used in transistorized
breaker-triggered ignition systems are identi-
cal to those employed with coil ignition. The
difference is in the control of the primary 
ignition circuit. Instead of being opened and
closed by contact-breaker points, the circuit 
is now controlled by a transistor – installed
along with supplementary electronics in the
ignition trigger box. In this system only the
control current for the transistorized ignition
system is switched by the breaker points.
Thus ultimate control of the system still re-
sides with the points. Figure 3 compares the
two designs.

When the breaker points (7) are closed,
control current flows to the base B, making
the path between the emitter E and the collec-
tor C on the transistor conductive. This
charges the coil. When the breaker points
open, no current flows to the base, and the
transistor blocks the flow of primary current.
The ballast resistors (3) limit the primary
current to the low-resistance, fast-charging
coil used in this ignition system. During start-
ing, compensation for the reduced battery
voltage is furnished by bypassing one of these
resistors at the starter’s Terminal 50. 

Advantages over coil ignition
Two major assets distinguish breaker-trig-
gered transistorized ignition from conven-
tional coil systems. Because there is only 
minimal current flow through the points,
their service life is increased dramatically. Yet
another advantage is the fact that the transis-
tor can control higher primary currents than
mechanical contact breakers. 
This higher primary current increases the
amount of energy stored in the coil, leading
to improvements in all high-voltage data,
 including voltage levels, spark duration and
spark current. 

Transistorized ignition with 
Hall-effect trigger
Design
In this transistorized ignition system the 
contact breakers that were still present in the
breaker-triggered system are replaced by a
Hall-effect sensor integrated within the dis-
tributor assembly. As the distributor shaft
turns, the rotor’s shutters (Fig. 4a, Pos. 1)
 rotate through the gap (4) in the magnetic
triggering unit. There is no direct mechanical
contact. The two soft-magnetic conductive 
elements with the permanent magnets (2)
generate a flux field. When the gap is vacated,
the flux field penetrates the Hall IC (3). When
the shutters enter the gap, most of the mag-
netic flux is dissipated around them instead
of impacting on the IC. This process pro-
duces a digital voltage signal (Fig. 4b).

Current and dwell-angle control
The application of rapid-charging, low-
 resistance coils made it necessary to limit 
primary current and power losses. The 
corresponding functions are integrated
within the ignition system’s trigger box.

Current control
The primary current is regulated to restrict
flow within the coil and limit energy build-up
to a defined level. Because the transistor en-
ters its active range in its current-control
phase, the voltage loss through the transistor
is greater than in the switching mode. The 
result is high power loss in the circuit. 

Dwell-angle control
An arrangement to regulate dwell to a suit-
able duration period is needed to minimize
this power loss. Because it is possible to exe-
cute control operations by shifting the voltage
threshhold using analog technology, the Hall-
effect trigger’s square-wave signal is converted
to ramp voltage by charging and discharging
a capacitor (Fig. 4c). 

The ignition point defined by the distribu-

tor’s adjustment angle lies at the end of the
shutter width, correlating with 70 %. The
dwell-angle control is set to provide a current
control period t1* that gives exactly the phase
lead required for dynamic operation. The t1
parameter is used to generate a voltage for
comparison with the ramp’s falling ramp. The
primary current is activated to initiate the
dwell period at the “ON” intersection. This
voltage can be varied to shift the intersection
on the ramp voltage curve to adjust the dwell
period’s start for any  operating conditions.

Since the number of shutters corresponds to
the number of cylinders, this voltage signal
thus corresponds to the signal from the con-
tact breaker in the breaker-triggered transis-
torized ignition system. One system relies on
the distributor shaft’s cam lobe to define the
dwell angle, while the other uses the pulse
factor of the voltage signal produced by the
shutters. Depending on the particular igni-
tion trigger box, the width b of the individual
shutters can determine the maximum dwell
angle. This angle thus remains constant
throughout the Hall sensor’s entire life, at
least on systems without separate dwell-angle
control. Dwell adjustments of the kind re-
quired with contact-breaker points thus 
become  redundant.

Transistorized ignition with 
induction-type pulse generator
Only minor differences distinguish transistor-
ized ignition with a distributor containing an
inductive trigger from the system with a Hall-
effect sensor (Fig. 5a). The permanent magnet
(1), inductive winding and core (2) on the in-
ductive pulse generator form a fixed unit, the
stator. A reluctor or “rotor” located opposite
this stationary arrangement rotates to trigger
the pulses. The rotor and core are manufac-
tured in soft-magnetic material and feature
spiked ends (stator and rotor spikes).

The operating concept exploits the contin-
uous change in the gap between the rotor and
stator spikes that accompanies rotation. This
variation is reflected in the magnetic-flux
field. The change in the flux field induces AC
voltage in the inductive winding (Fig. 5b).
Peak voltage varies according 
to engine speed: approximately 0.5 V at low
rpm, and roughly 100 V at high revs. The 
frequency f is the number of sparks per
minute.

Control of current and dwell angle with 
inductively triggered ignition are basically 
the same as with Hall-effect transistorized 
ignition. In this case no generation of a ramp
voltage is required, as the AC induction
voltage can be used directly for dwell-angle
control.

Electronic ignition
As demands for precise engine management
grew, the very basic ignition timing curves 
offered by the centrifugal and vacuum mech-
anisms in conventional distributors proved
unable to satisfy the requirements.  
In the early 1980s the introduction of auto-
motive microelectronics opened up new
 options for ignition-system design. 

Design and operation 
Electronic ignition requires neither centrifu-
gal nor vacuum-based timing adjustment. In-
stead, sensors monitor engine speed and load
factor and then convert these into electrical
signal data for processing in the ignition con-
trol unit. The microcontroller is  essential for
achieving the functionality  associated with
electronic ignition. 

Engine speed is registered by an inductive
pulse sensor than scans the teeth of a reluctor
mounted on the crankshaft. An alternative is
to monitor rpm using a Hall-effect sensor in
the ignition distributor.

A hose connects the atmosphere within the

intake manifold to a pressure sensor in the
control unit. If the engine is equipped with
electronic injection then the load signal em-
ployed to govern the mixture-formation
process can also be tapped for ignition
 purposes.

The control unit uses these data to generate
the control signal for the ignition’s coil driver.
The corresponding circuitry can be integrated
within the control unit or mounted externally
on the ignition coil, etc.

The most pronounced asset of electronic
ignition is its ability to use a program map for
ignition timing. The program map contains
the ideal ignition timing for range of engine
operating coordinates as  defined by engine
rpm and load factor; the timing is defined 
to provide the best compromise for each 
performance criterion  during the engine’s 
design process (Fig. 6a). Ignition timing for
any given operating  coordinates is  selected
based on

Designs assign priority to specific individual
parameters based on the optimization cri -
teria. This is why 3D representations of pro-
gram maps for systems with electronic con-
trol show a craggy and variegated landscape,
as opposed to the smooth slopes of mechani-
cal timing-adjustment systems (Fig. 6b). 

A map based on engine speed and battery
voltage is available for dwell angle. This en-
sures that the energy stored in the ignition
coil can be regulated just as precisely as with
separate dwell control. 

A number of other parameters can also
have an effect upon the ignition angle, and if
these are to be taken into account this  entails
the use of additional sensors to monitor
(cid:2) Engine temperature
(cid:2) Intake-air temperature (optional)
(cid:2) Throttle-plate aperture (at idle and

at WOT)

Distributorless (fully-electronic) ignition
Fully-electronic ignition includes the func-
tionality of basic electronic systems. As a 
major difference, the distributor used for 
the earlier rotating high-voltage distribution
has now been deleted in favour of stationary
voltage distribution governed by the control
unit. The fully-electronic ignition system gen-
erates a separate, dedicated control signal for
the individual cylinders, each of which must
be equipped with its own ignition coil. Dual-
spark ignition uses one coil for two cylinders.

Advantages 
The advantages of distributorless ignition are
(cid:2) Substantially reduced electromagnetic in-
terference, as there are no exposed sparks

(cid:2) No rotating parts

It is also possible to monitor battery voltage –

gle – without a sensor. An analog-digital con-
verter transforms the analog signals into digi-
tal information suitable for processing in the
microcontroller.

Inductive ignition system

Design

Inductive ignition system

Ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the gaso-
line engine is electric; it is produced by gen-
erating a flashover between the electrodes
on a spark plug. The ignition-coil energy
converted in the spark ignites the com-
pressed mixture immediately adjacent to
the spark plug, creating a flame front which
then spreads to ignite the mixture in the
 entire combustion chamber. The inductive
ignition system generates in each power
stroke the high voltage required for flash -
over and the spark duration required for
 ignition. The electrical energy drawn from
the vehicle electrical system battery is tem-
porarily stored in the ignition coil for this
purpose. 

The most significant application for the in-
ductive ignition system is in passenger cars
with gasoline engines. The most commonly
used are four-stroke engines with four cylin-
ders. 

Design of the ignition circuit of an inductive ignition system

Design

Figure 1 shows the basic design of the igni-
tion circuit of an inductive ignition system
using the example of a system with distribu-
torless (stationary) voltage distribution – 
as is used in all current applications – and
single-spark ignition coils. The ignition cir-
cuit comprises the following components: 
(cid:2) Ignition driver stage (5), which is inte-
grated in the Motronic ECU or in the
 ignition coil

(cid:2) Ignition coils (3), designed as pencil coils
or as a compact coil to generate one spark
(as illustrated) or two sparks

(cid:2) Spark plugs (4), and 
(cid:2) Connecting devices and interference sup-

pressors 

Older ignition systems with rotating high-
voltage distribution require an additional
high-voltage distributor. This ensures that
the ignition energy generated in the ignition
coil is directed to the correct spark plug.

Function and method of operation

153

Function and method 
of operation

It is the function of the ignition to ignite the
compressed air/fuel mixture and thus initi-
ate its combustion. Safe combustion of the
mixture must be guaranteed in the process.
To this end, sufficient energy must be stored
in the ignition coil prior to the moment of
ignition and the ignition spark must be gen-
erated at the correct moment of ignition.

All the components of the ignition system

are adapted in terms of their designs and
performance data to the demands of the
overall system.

Generating the ignition spark
A magnetic field is built up in the ignition
coil when a current flows in the primary
 circuit. The ignition energy required for
 ignition is stored in this magnetic field.

Interrupting the coil current at the mo-
ment of ignition causes the magnetic field to
collapse. This rapid magnetic-field change
induces a high voltage (Fig. 2) on the sec-
ondary side of the ignition coil as a result 
of the large number of turns (turns ratio
 approx. 1:100). When the ignition voltage 
is reached, flashover occurs at the spark 
plug and the compressed air/fuel mixture 
is ignited.

The current in the primary winding only
gradually attains its setpoint value because
of the induced countervoltage. Because the
energy stored in the ignition coil is depen-
dent on the current (E = 1/2LI2), a certain
amount of time (dwell period time) is re-
quired in order to store the energy necessary
for ignition. This dwell period is dependent
on, among others, the vehicle system volt-
age. The ECU program calculates from the
dwell period and the moment of ignition the
cut-in point, and cuts the ignition coil in via
the ignition driver stage and out again at the
moment of ignition.

Flame-front propagation
After the flashover, the voltage at the spark
plug drops to the spark voltage (Fig. 2). The
spark voltage is dependent on the length of
the spark plasma (electrode gap and deflec-
tion due to flow) and ranges between a few
hundred volts and well over 1 kV. The igni-
tion-coil energy is converted in the ignition
spark during the ignition-spark period; this
spark duration lasts between 100 μs to over
2 ms. Following the breakaway of the spark,
the attenuated voltage decays.

The electrical spark between the spark-
plug electrodes generates a high-tempera-
ture plasma. When the mixture at the spark
plug is ignitable and sufficient energy is sup-
plied by the ignition system, the flame core
that is created develops into an automati-
cally propagating flame front.

Moment of ignition
The instant at which the spark ignites the
air/fuel mixture within the combustion
chamber must be selected with extreme
 precision. It is usually specified as an igni-
tion angle in °cks (crankshaft) referred to
Top Dead Center (TDC). This variable has 
a  crucial influence on engine operation and
determines

 increase. The pressure wave which is gener-
ated propagates, strikes the cylinder walls,
and can be heard as combustion knock. 

If knock continues over a longer period 

of time, the engine can incur mechanical
damage caused by the pressure waves and
the excessive thermal loading. To prevent
knock on today’s high-compression engines,
no matter whether of the manifold-injection
or direct-injection type, knock control is
now a standard feature of the engine-man-
agement system. With knock control, knock
sensors (structure-borne-noise sensors)
 detect the start of knock and the ignition
timing is  retarded at the cylinder concerned
(Fig. 4). The pressure increase after the mix-
ture has ignited therefore occurs later, which
reduces the tendency to knock. When the
knocking stops, the ignition-timing adjust-
ment is reversed in stages. To obtain the
best-possible engine efficiency, therefore, 
the basic adaptation of the ignition angle
(ignition map) can be located directly at 
the knock limit.

(cid:2) The delivered torque
(cid:2) The exhaust-gas emissions, and 
(cid:2) The fuel consumption

The moment of ignition is specified in such
a way that all requirements are met as effec-
tively as possible. However, continuous en-
gine knocking must not develop during
 operation.

The influencing variables that determine

the moment of ignition are engines speed
and engine load, or torque. Additional vari-
ables, such as, for example, engine tempera-
ture, are also used to determine the optimal
moment of ignition. These variables are
recorded by sensors and then relayed to the
engine ECU (Motronic). The moment of ig-
nition is calculated from program maps and
characteristic curves, and the actuation sig-
nal for the ignition driver stage is generated.

Knock control
Knock is a phenomenon which occurs 
when ignition takes place too early (Fig. 3).
Here, once regular combustion has started,
the rapid pressure increase in the combus-
tion chamber leads to auto-ignition of the
unburnt residual mixture which has not
been reached by the flame front. The result-
ing abrupt combustion of the residual mix-
ture leads to a considerable local pressure

Ignition parameters

Moment of ignition
Engine-speed and load dependence
Once ignition has been initiated by the
 ignition spark, it takes a few milliseconds 
for the air/fuel mixture to burn completely.
This  period of time remains roughly con-
stant as long as the mixture composition re-
mains unchanged. The moment of ignition
point must be selected so that main com-
bustion, and the accompanying pressure
peak in the cylinder, takes place shortly after
TDC. As engine speed increases, the ignition
angle must therefore be advanced.

The cylinder charge also has an effect 
on the combustion curve. The flame front
propagates at a slower rate when the cylin-
der charge is low. For this reason, with a low
cylinder charge, the ignition angle must also
be advanced.

In the case of gasoline direct injection, the
range for variation of the moment of igni-
tion in stratified-charge mode is limited by
the end of injection and the time needed for
mixture preparation during the compression
stroke.

Basic adaptation of ignition angle
In electronically controlled ignition systems,
the ignition map (Fig. 5) takes into account
the influence of engine speed and cylinder
charge on the ignition angle. This map is
stored in the engine-management system’s
data memory, and forms the basic adapta-
tion of the ignition angle.

The map’s x and y axes represent the en-
gine speed and the relative air charge. A spe-
cific number of values, typically 16, forms
the data points of the map. One ignition an-
gle is stored for each pair of values. The map
therefore contains 256 adjustable ignition-
angle values. By applying linear interpola-
tion between two data points, the number 
of ignition-angle values is increased to 4096.
Using the ignition-map principle for elec-

tronic control of the ignition angle means
that, for every engine operating point, it is
possible to select the best-possible ignition
angle. These maps are ascertained on the en-
gine test stand, or dynamic power analyzer,
where demands pertaining to, for example,
noise, comfort and component protection
are also taken into account.

Additive ignition-angle corrections
Different impacting factors on the moment
of ignition are taken into account through
additive corrections of the basic ignition
 angle, such as, for instance, knock control 
or warming-up after the starting phase. 
The engine temperature has a further influ-
ence on the selection of the ignition angle
(e.g., shifting of the knock limit when the
engine is hot).

Temperature-dependent ignition-angle

corrections are therefore also necessary.
Such corrections are stored in the data
memory in the form of fixed values or
 characteristic curves (e.g., temperature-
 dependent correction). They shift the basic
ignition angle by the specified amount. 
The ignition-angle correction can be 
either an advance or a retardation.

156

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

Ignition angles for specific operating
 conditions
Specific operating states, e.g., starting or
stratified-charge mode with gasoline direct
injection, require ignition angles that deviate
from the ignition map. In such cases, access
is obtained to special ignition angles stored
in the data memory.

Dwell period
The energy stored in the ignition coil is de-
pendent on the level of the primary current
at the moment of ignition (cut-out current)
and the inductance of the primary winding.
The level of the cut-out current is essentially
dependent on the cut-in period (dwell pe-
riod) and the vehicle system voltage. The
dwell periods for obtaining the desired cut-
out current are stored in voltage-dependent
curves or program maps. Changing the
dwell period by way of the temperature 
can also be compensated for.

In order not to thermally overload the
 ignition coil, it is essential to adhere rigidly
to the time required to generate the required
ignition energy in the coil. 

Ignition voltage
The ignition voltage at the point where
flashover between the spark-plug electrodes
occurs is the ignition-voltage demand. 
It is dependent, among other things, on 
(cid:2) The density of the air/fuel mixture in the
combustion chamber, and thus on the
moment of ignition 

(cid:2) The composition of the air/fuel mixture

(excess-air factor, lambda value)
(cid:2) The flow velocity and turbulence 
(cid:2) The electrode geometry
(cid:2) The electrode material, and
(cid:2) The electrode gap

It is vital that the ignition voltage supplied
by the ignition system always exceed the
 ignition-voltage demand under all condi-
tions.

Ignition energy
The cut-out current and the ignition-coil
parameters determine the amount of energy
that the coil stores for application as ignition
energy in the spark. The level of ignition en-
ergy has a decisive influence on flame-front
propagation. Good flame-front propagation
is essential to delivering high-performance
engine operation coupled with low levels 
of toxic emissions. This places considerable
demands on the ignition system.

Energy balance of an ignition
The energy stored in the ignition coil is
 released as soon as the ignition spark is
 initiated. This energy is divided into two
separate components.

Spark head
In order that an ignition spark can be gener-
ated at the spark plug, first the secondary-
side capacitance C of the ignition circuit
must be charged, and this is released again
on flashover. The energy required for this
 increases quadratically with the ignition
voltage U (E = 1/2 CU2). Figure 6 shows the
component of this energy contained in the
spark head.

Spark tail
The energy still remaining in the ignition
coil after flashover (inductive component) 
is then released in the course of the spark
duration. This energy represents the differ-
ence between the total energy stored in the
ignition coil and the energy released during
capacitive discharge. In other words: The
higher the ignition-voltage demand, the
greater the component of total energy con-
tained in the spark head, and the less energy
is converted in the spark duration, i.e., the
shorter the spark duration. When the igni-
tion-voltage demand is high, due for in-
stance to badly worn spark plugs, the energy
stored in the spark tail may no longer be
enough to completely burn an already ig-
nited mixture or to re-ignite a spark that 
has broken away.

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

157

Further increases in the ignition-voltage de-
mand lead to the ignition-miss limit being
reached. Here, the available energy is no
longer enough to generate a flashover, and
instead it decays in a damped oscillation
 (ignition miss).

Energy losses
Figure 6 shows a simplified representation 
of the existing conditions. Ohmic resistance
in the ignition coil and the ignition cables
combined with the suppression resistors
cause losses, which are then unavailable as
ignition energy.

Additional losses are produced by shunt
resistors. While these losses can result from
contamination on the high-voltage connec-
tions, the primary cause is soot and deposits
on the spark plugs within the combustion
chamber.

The level of shunt losses is also dependent
on the ignition-voltage demand. The higher
the voltage applied at the spark plug, the
greater the currents discharging through 
the shunt resistors.

Mixture ignition
Under ideal (e.g., laboratory) conditions, the
energy required to ignite an air/fuel mixture
with an electrical spark for each individual
injection is approximately 0.2 mJ, provided
the mixture in question is static, homoge-
neous and stoichiometric. Under such con-
ditions, rich and lean mixtures require in
 excess of 3 mJ. 

The energy that is actually required to ig-
nite the mixture is only a fraction of the to-
tal energy in the ignition spark, the ignition
energy. With conventional ignition systems,
energy levels in excess of 15 mJ are needed 
to generate a high-voltage flashover at the
moment of ignition at high breakdown volt-
ages. This additional energy is required to
charge the capacitance on the secondary
side. Further energy is required to maintain
a specific spark duration and to compensate
for losses, due for instance to contamination
shunts at the spark plugs. These require-
ments amount to ignition energies of at least
30...50 mJ, a figure which corresponds to 
an energy level of 60...120 mJ stored in the
ignition coil.

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

Turbulence within the mixture of the kind
encountered when engines with gasoline
 direct injection are operated in stratified-
charge mode can deflect the ignition spark
to such an extent that it breaks away (Fig. 7).
A number of follow-up sparks is then
needed to ignite the mixture, and this energy
must also be provided by the ignition coil.
The ignition tendency decreases in the
case of lean mixtures. A particularly high
level of energy is therefore required to be
able to cover the increased ignition-voltage
demand and at the same time to ensure an
effectively long spark duration.

If inadequate ignition energy is available,
the mixture will fail to ignite. No flame front
is established, and combustion miss occurs.
This is why the system must furnish ade-
quate reserves of ignition energy: To ensure
reliable detonation of the air/fuel mixture,
even under unfavorable external conditions.
It may be enough to ignite just a small por-
tion of the mixture directly with the spark
plug. The mixture igniting at the spark plug
then ignites the remaining mixture in the
cylinder and thereby initiates the combus-
tion process.

Factors affecting ignition performance
Efficient preparation of the mixture with
unobstructed access to the spark plug im-
proves ignition performance, as do extended
spark durations and large spark lengths or
large electrode gaps. Mixture turbulence 
can also be an advantage, provided enough
energy is available for follow-up ignition
sparks should these be needed. Turbulence
supports rapid flame-front distribution in
the combustion chamber, and with it the
complete combustion of the mixture in the
entire combustion chamber.

Spark-plug contamination is also a signif-
icant factor. If the spark plugs are very dirty,
energy is discharged from the ignition coil
through the spark-plug shunt (deposits)
during the period in which the high voltage
is being built up. This reduces the high volt-
age whilst simultaneously shortening spark
duration. This affects exhaust emissions, 
and can even lead to ignition misses under
extreme conditions, as when the spark plugs
are severely contaminated or wet. 

Ignition misses lead to combustion mis -
ses, which increase both fuel consumption
and pollutant emissions, and can also dam-
age the catalytic converter.

All electrical ignition systems are high-voltage
systems. To avoid potential dangers, always
switch off the ignition or disconnect the power
source before working on any ignition system.
These precautions apply to, e.g.,
(cid:2) Replacing components, such as ignition coils,

spark plugs, ignition cables, etc.

(cid:2) Connecting engine testers, such as timing
stroboscope, dwell-angle/speed tester,
 ignition oscilloscope, etc.

When checking the ignition system, remember
that dangerously high levels of voltage are pre-
sent within the system whenever the ignition is
on. All tests and inspections should therefore
only be carried out by qualified professional
 personnel.

have to be synchronized by means of a
camshaft sensor with the camshaft. 

System with dual-spark ignition coils
One ignition driver stage and one ignition
coil are allocated to every two cylinders. 
The ends of the secondary winding are each
connected to a spark plug in different cylin-
ders. The cylinders have been chosen so that
when one cylinder is in the compression
stroke, the other is in the exhaust stroke (ap-
plies only to engines with an even number
of cylinders). Flashover occurs at both spark
plugs at the moment of ignition. Because it
is important to prevent residual exhaust gas
or fresh induction gas from being ignited 
by the spark during the exhaust stroke addi-
tional spark, the latitude for varying ignition
timing is limited with this system. However,
it does not need to be synchronized with 
the camshaft. Because of these limitations,
dual-spark ignition coils cannot be recom-
mended.

Voltage-distribution concept

Voltage distribution

Rotating high-voltage distribution
The high voltage generated in the ignition
coil (Fig. 8a, Pos. 2) must be applied at 
the correct spark plug at the moment of 
ignition. In the case of rotating high-voltage
 distribution, the high voltage generated by
this single ignition coil is mechanically dis-
tributed to the individual spark plugs (5) 
by an ignition distributor (3). 
The rotation speed and the position of 
the distributor  rotor, which establishes the
electrical connection between the ignition
coil and the spark plug, are coupled to the
camshaft.

This form of distribution is no longer of any
significance to new, modern-day engine-
management systems.

Distributorless (stationary) voltage 
distribution
The mechanical components have been
 dispensed with in the distributorless, or
 stationary, voltage-distribution system 
(Fig. 8b). Voltage is distributed on the
 primary side of the ignition coils, which 
are connected directly to the spark plugs.
This permits wear-free and loss-free voltage
distribution. There are two versions of this
type of voltage distribution.

System with single-spark ignition coils
Each cylinder is allocated an ignition driver
stage and an ignition coil. The engine ECU
actuates the ignition driver stages in speci-
fied firing order. 

Since there are no distributor losses, these

ignition coils can be very small in design.
They are preferably mounted directly over
the spark plug. 

Distributorless voltage distribution with
single-spark ignition coils can be used with
any number of cylinders. There are no limi-
tations on the ignition-timing adjustment
range. In this case, the spark plug of the
cylinder which is at firing TDC is the one
that fires. However, the system does also

Inductive ignition system

Ignition driver stage

Ignition driver stage

Function and method of operation 
The function of the ignition driver stage is 
to control the flow of primary current in the
ignition coil. It is usually designed as a three-
stage power transistor with BIP technology
(Bosch Integrated Power, bipolar technol-
ogy). The functions of primary- voltage limi-
tation and primary-current  limitation are
 integrated as monolithic  components on the
ignition driver stage, and protect the ignition
components against overload. 

During operation, the ignition driver
stage and the ignition coil both heat up. 
In order not to exceed the permissible oper-
ating temperatures, it is necessary that ap-
propriate measures be taken to ensure that
the heat losses are reliably dissipated to the
surroundings even when outside tempera-
tures are high. In order to avoid high power
loss in the ignition driver stage, the function
of primary-current limitation is only to
limit the current in the event of a fault 
(e.g., short circuit).

In the future, the three-stage circuit-breakers
will be superseded by the new IGBTs (Insu-
lated Gate Bipolar Transistors, hybrid form
on field-effect and bipolar transistors), also
for ignition applications. The IGBT has
some advantages over BIP:
(cid:2) Virtually power-free actuation (voltage

 instead of current)
(cid:2) Low saturation voltage
(cid:2) Higher load current
(cid:2) Lower switching times
(cid:2) Higher clamp voltage
(cid:2) Higher holding temperature
(cid:2) Protected against polarity reversal in the

12 V vehicle electrical system

Design variations 
Ignition driver stages are categorized into
internal and external driver stages. The for-
mer are integrated on the engine ECU’s
printed-circuit board, and the latter are
 located in their own housing outside the
 engine ECU. Due to the costs involved,
 external driver stages are no longer used 
on new developments. 

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly
common for driver stages to be incorporated
in the ignition coil. This solution avoids ca-
bles in the wiring harness which carry high
currents and are subjected to high voltages.
In addition, the power loss incurred in the
Motronic ECU is accordingly lower. Stricter
demands with regard to actuation, diagnos-
tic capability and temperature load are made
of the driver stages integrated in the ignition
coil. These demands are derived from the
 installation circumstances directly on the
engine with higher ambient temperatures,
ground offsets between ECU and ignition
coil, and the additional expenditure involved
in transmitting diagnostic information from
the ignition coil to the ECU either via an
 additional cable or through the intelligent
use of the control line to include the return
transmission of diagnostic information.

Connecting devices and interference suppressors

161

Normally, the suppression resistors are inte-
grated in the spark-plug connectors and ca-
ble connectors. Spark plugs are also available
which feature an integral suppression resis-
tor. However, increasing resistance on the
secondary side leads to additional energy
losses in the ignition circuit, with lower igni-
tion energy at the spark plug as the ultimate
result. 

Interference radiation can be even further
reduced by partially or completely screening
the ignition system. This screening includes
the ignition cables. This effort is justified
only in special cases (official government
and military vehicles, radio equipment with
high transmitting power).

Connecting devices and
 interference suppressors

Ignition cables
The high voltage generated in the ignition
coil must be delivered to the spark plug. 
For this purpose, plastic-insulated, high-
voltage-proof cables with special connectors
at their ends for contacting the high-voltage
components are used with ignition coils
which are not mounted directly on the 
spark plug (e.g., dual-spark ignition coils). 
Since, for the ignition system, each high-

voltage cable represents a capacitive load
which reduces the available secondary
 voltage, the ignition cables must be kept 
as short as possible.

Interference-suppression resistors, 
screening
Each flashover is a source of interference 
due to its pulse-shaped discharge. Interfer-
ence-suppression resistors in the high-volt-
age circuit limit the peak current during
 discharge. In order to minimize the interfer-
ence radiation from the high-voltage circuit,
the suppression resistors should be installed
as close as possible to the source of inter -
ference.

Ignition coils

Function

Ignition coils

Within the inductive ignition system, the ig-
nition coil is the component responsible for
converting the low battery voltage into the
high voltage required to generate flashover
at the spark plug. The ignition coil operates
on the basis of electromagnetic induction:
The energy stored in the magnetic field 
of the primary winding is transmitted by
magnetic induction to the secondary side 
of the coil.

Function

The high voltage and ignition energy re-
quired to ignite the air/fuel mixture must 
be generated and stored prior to flashover.
The coil acts as a dual-function device by
serving as both transformer and energy
 accumulator. It stores the magnetic energy
built up in the magnetic field generated 
by the primary current and then releases 

this energy when the primary current is
 deactivated at the moment of ignition. 

The coil must be precisely matched to the
other components in the ignition system
(ignition driver stage, spark plugs). 
Essential parameters are:
(cid:2) The spark energy Wsp available to the

spark plug

(cid:2) The spark current Isp applied to the 
spark plug at the flashover point

(cid:2) The duration of the spark at the spark

plug tsp, and

(cid:2) An ignition voltage Uig adequate for all

 operating conditions

Important considerations in designing the
ignition system include the interactions of
individual system parameters with the igni-
tion driver stage, the ignition coil and the
spark plug, as well as the specific demands
associated with the engine’s design concept.

Ignition coils

Function, requirements

163

Examples:
(cid:2) To ensure secure and reliable ignition 
of the mixture under all conditions,
 turbocharged engines need more spark
energy than manifold-injection engines;
engines with gasoline direct injection have
the highest energy requirement of all.
(cid:2) Spark current has a relatively limited

 effect on the service life of modern-day
spark plugs.

(cid:2) Turbo- and supercharged engines need

consistently higher ignition voltages than
non-charged engines.

(cid:2) The ignition driver stage and the ignition
coil must be mutually matched for correct
configuration of the operating point
 (primary current).

(cid:2) The connection between the ignition coil
and the spark plug must be designed for
safe and reliable performance under all
conditions (voltage, temperature, vibra-
tion, resistance to aggressive substances).

Areas of application
Ignition coils made their debut in Bosch ig-
nition systems when battery-based ignition
replaced magneto ignition in the 1930s.
Since then, they have been subject to ongo-
ing improvements while being adapted to
various new areas of applications. Coils are
used in all vehicles and machines equipped
with inductive ignition systems. 

Requirements

Emission-control legislation imposes limits
on pollutant emissions from internal-com-
bustion engines. Ignition misses and incom-
plete mixture combustion, which lead to
rises in HC emissions, must be avoided. 
It is thus vital to have coils that consistently
provide adequate levels of ignition energy
throughout their service lives. 

In addition to these considerations, coils
must also suit the geometry and design con-
figuration of the engine. Earlier ignition sys-
tems with rotating high-voltage distribution
(distributor, [asphalt] ignition coil, ignition
cables) featured standardized coils in for
mounting on the engine or the vehicle body.

The ignition coil is subject to severe perfor-
mance demands – electrical, chemical and
mechanical – yet still expected to provide
fault- and maintenance-free operation for
the entire life of the vehicle. Depending on
where they are installed in the vehicle –
 often directly in the cylinder head – today’s
 ignition coils must be able to operate under
the following conditions:
(cid:2) Operating-temperature range of

– 40...+ 150 °C

(cid:2) Secondary voltage up to 30,000 V
(cid:2) Primary current between 7 and 15 A
(cid:2) Dynamic vibration loading up to 50 g
(cid:2) Durable resistance to various substances

(gasoline, oil, brake fluid, etc.)

Design
Primary and secondary windings
The ignition coil (Fig. 1, Pos. 3) operates in
accordance with the principle of a trans-
former. Two windings surround a shared
iron core. 

The primary winding consists of thick
wire with a relatively low number of turns.
One end of the winding is connected to 
the battery’s positive terminal (1) via the
 ignition switch (terminal 15). The other 
end (terminal 1) is connected to the ignition
driver stage (4) to control the flow of pri-
mary current.

Although contact-breaker points were still
being used to control primary current as late
as the end of the 1970s, this arrangement is
now obsolete.

The secondary winding consists of thin

wire with a larger number of turns. 
The turns ratio usually ranges between 
1:50 and 1:150.

In the basic economy circuit (Fig. 2a), one
terminal from the primary winding is con-
nected to one terminal on the secondary
winding, and these are both linked to termi-
nal 15 (ignition switch). The other end of
the primary winding is connected to the
 ignition driver stage (terminal 1). The sec-
ondary winding’s second terminal (termi-
nal 4) is connected to the ignition distribu-
tor or to the spark plug. The autotrans-
former principle makes the coil less expen-
sive thanks to the common terminal at ter-
minal 15. But because there is no mutual
electrical isolation between the two electric
circuits, electrical interference from the coil
can be propagated into the vehicle’s electri-
cal system.

The primary and secondary windings 
are not interconnected in Figs. 2b and 2c.
On the single-spark coil, one side of the sec-
ondary winding is connected to ground (ter-
minal 4a), while the other side (terminal 4)
leads directly to the spark plug. Both of the
secondary-winding connections on the
dual-spark ignition coil (terminals 4a and
4b) lead to a spark plug.

Design and method of operation

In systems with dual-spark coils, the switch-
on spark is suppressed by the high flashover
voltage in the series circuit feeding the two
spark plugs without additional measures. 

Deactivating the primary current produces 
a self-induction voltage of several hundred
volts in the primary winding. To protect the
driver stage, this is limited to 200...400 V. 

Generating the magnetic field
A magnetic field is generated in the primary
winding as soon as the driver stage com-
pletes the circuit. Self-induction creates an
inductive voltage in this winding, which
 according to Lenz’s law opposes the cause 
– i.e., the generation of the magnetic field.
This rule explains why the rate at which the
magnetic field is generated is always com-
paratively low (Fig. 3) in relation to the iron
cross-section and the winding (inductance).
The primary current will continue to rise

while the circuit remains closed; beyond a
certain current flow, magnetic saturation oc-
curs in the magnetic circuit. The actual level
is determined by the ferromagnetic material
used. Inductance falls and current flow rises
more sharply. Losses within the ignition coil

Primary-current curve in the ignition coil

Operating principle
High-voltage generation
The engine ECU activates the ignition driver
stage for the calculated dwell period. During
this period, the coil’s primary current climbs
to the setpoint level to generate a magnetic
field.

The level of the primary current and the

coil’s primary inductance determine the
amount of energy stored in the magnetic
field.

At the moment of ignition (ignition
point), the ignition driver stage interrupts
the current flow. The resulting shift in the
magnetic field induces secondary voltage 
in the coil’s secondary winding. The maxi-
mum possible secondary voltage (sec-
ondary-voltage supply) is dependent on 
the energy stored in the ignition coil, the
winding capacitance, the coil’s turns ratio,
the secondary load (spark plug), and the
 primary-voltage limitation (clamp voltage)
of the ignition driver stage. 

The secondary voltage must in any case
exceed the voltage level required for flash -
over at the spark plug (ignition-voltage
 demand). The spark energy must be suffi-
ciently high to ignite the mixture even when
follow-up sparks are generated. Follow-up,
or secondary, sparks occur when the ignition
spark is deflected by turbulence in the mix-
ture and breaks away. 

When the primary current is activated, 
an undesired voltage of roughly 1...2 kV is
induced in the secondary winding (switch-
on voltage); its polarity is opposed to that 
of the high voltage. A flashover at the spark
plug (switch-on spark) must be avoided. 

In systems with rotating high-voltage dis-
tribution, the switch-on spark is effectively
suppressed by the upstream distributor
spark gap. In systems with distributorless
(stationary) voltage distribution with single-
spark ignition coils, a diode (AAS diode, see
Figs. 2 a and 2 b) suppresses the switch-on
spark in the high-voltage circuit. This AAS
diode can be installed on the “hot” side
 (facing toward the spark plug) or the “cold”
side (facing away from the spark plug).

Ignition coils

Design and method of operation

also rise steeply. It is therefore sensible to
have the operating point as far as possible
below the magnetic-saturation level. This is
determined by means of the dwell period. 

Magnetization curve and hysteresis
The ignition coil’s core consists of a soft-
magnetic material (in contrast, permanent
magnets are hard-magnetic material). This
material displays a characteristic magnetiza-
tion curve that defines the relationship be-
tween the magnetic field strength H and the
flux density B within it (Fig. 4). Once maxi-
mum flux density is reached, the effect of
additional increases in field strength on 
flux density will be minimal: saturation 
has occurred.

Yet another property of this material is
hysteresis in the magnetization curve. This
material property denotes a situation where
the flux density (i.e., the magnetization) is
dependent not only on the currently effec-
tive field strength but also on the earlier
magnetic state. The magnetization curve
 assumes a different shape in the case of
magnetization (increasing field strength)
than it does in the case of demagnetization

(decreasing field strength). The intrinsic
losses in the material used are proportional
to the level of hysteresis. The area included
by the hysteresis curve is a measure of the
intrinsic losses.

Magnetic circuit
The material most commonly used in igni-
tion coils is electrical sheet steel, processed
in various layer depths and to various speci-
fications. Depending on what is required of
it, the material is either grain-oriented (high
maximum flux density, expensive) or non-
grain-oriented (low maximum flux density).

Sheet metal with layer depths of
0.3...0.5 mm is most commonly used.
 Mutually insulated plates are used to reduce
eddy-current losses. The plates are stamped,
combined in plate packs and joined to-
gether; this process provides the required
thickness and geometrical shape.

The best possible geometry for the mag-
netic circuit must be defined to obtain the
desired electrical performance data for an
ignition coil from any given coil geometry.

Design and method of operation

To meet the electrical requirements (spark
duration, spark energy, secondary-voltage
rise, secondary-voltage level), an air gap is
needed which effects a shear in the magnetic
circuit (Fig. 5, Pos. 1). A larger air gap
(greater shear) permits a higher magnetic
field strength in the magnetic circuit and
thus leads to a higher magnetic energy that
can be stored. This substantially raises the
current levels at which magnetic saturation
occurs in the magnetic circuit. Without this
air gap, saturation would occur at low cur-
rents, and subsequent rises in current flow
would produce only insignificant increases
in levels of stored energy (Fig. 6).

What is important here is that the over-

whelming proportion of the magnetic 
energy is stored in the gap.

In the coil-development process, FEM
simulation is employed to define the dimen-
sions for the magnetic circuit and the air gap
that will provide the required electrical data.
The object is to obtain ideal geometry for
maximum storable magnetic energy for a
given current flow without saturating the
magnetic circuit.

It is also possible to respond to the require-
ments associated with limited installation
space, especially important with pencil coils,
by installing permanent magnets (Fig. 5,
Pos. 1) to increase the magnetic energy
available for storage. The permanent mag-
net’s poles are arranged to allow it to gener-
ate a magnetic field opposed to the field in
the winding. The advantage of this premag-
netization lies in the fact that more energy
can be stored in this magnetic circuit.

Switch-on sparks
Activating the primary current changes the
current gradients to produce a sudden shift
in magnetic flux in the iron core. This in-
duces voltage in the secondary winding.
 Because the gradient for the current change
is positive, the polarity of this voltage polar-
ity is opposed to that of the induced high
voltage when the circuit is switched off.
 Because this gradient is very small relative to
the gradients that occur when the primary
current is deactivated, the induced voltage 
is relatively low, despite the large turns ratio
arising from the disparity in turn numbers
between the two windings. It lies within a
range of 1...2 kV, and could be enough to
promote spark generation and mixture igni-
tion under some conditions. To prevent pos-
sible engine damage, preventing a flashover
(switch-on spark) at the spark plug is vital. 
In systems with rotating high-voltage dis-
tribution, this switch-on spark is suppressed
by the upstream distributor spark gap. The
rotor-arm contact is not directly across from
the cap contact when activation occurs. 

In systems with distributorless (station-
ary) voltage distribution and single-spark
 ignition coils, the AAS diode (Activation 
Arc Suppression) suppresses the switch-on
spark (see Fig. 1, Pos. 2). With dual-spark
coils, the switch-on spark is suppressed 
by the high flashover voltage of the series
circuit with its two spark plugs, and no
 supplementary measures are required.

Ignition coils

Design and method of operation

Heat generation in the coil
The efficiency, defined as the available sec-
ondary energy relative to the stored primary
energy, is on the order of 50...60 %. Under
certain boundary conditions, high-perfor-
mance ignition coils for special applications
can achieve efficiency levels as high as 80 %. 
The difference in energy is primarily con-
verted into heat through the resistance losses
in the windings as well as remagnetization
and eddy-current losses. 

A driver stage integrated directly in the
coil can represent yet another source of ther-
mal loss. The primary current causes a volt-
age drop in the semiconductive material,
leading to lost efficiency. A further and
 thoroughly significant energy loss is attrib-
utable to the switching response when the
primary current is deactivated, especially
when the driver stage is “slow” in its dy-
namic response. 

High secondary voltages are usually lim-
ited by the restriction on primary voltage in
the driver stage, where part of the energy
stored in the coil is dissipated as thermal
loss. 

Capacitive load
Capacitance in the ignition coil, the ignition
cable, the spark-plug well, the spark plug,
and adjacent engine components is low in
absolute terms, but remains a factor of not
inconsiderable significance in view of the
high voltages and voltage gradients. The in-
creased capacitance reduces the rise in sec-
ondary voltage. Resistive losses in the wind-
ings are higher, high voltage is reduced. 
In the end, all of the potential secondary
 energy is not available to ignite the mixture.

Spark energy
The electrical energy available for the spark
plug within the ignition coil is called spark
energy. It is an essential criterion in ignition-
coil design; depending on the winding con-
figuration, it determines such factors as the
spark current and the spark duration at the
spark plug. 

Spark energies of 30...50 mJ are the norm
for igniting mixtures in naturally aspirated
and turbocharged engines. A higher spark
energy (up to 100 mJ) is needed for safe 
and reliable ignition at all engine operating
points in engines with gasoline direct injec-
tion.

Ignition coils

Design and method of operation

169

Ignition-coil types
Single-spark ignition coil
Each spark plug has its own ignition coil in
systems with single-spark ignition coils. 

that no synchronization with the camshaft is
required with this ignition system. However,
this ignition coil can only be used in engines
with an even number of cylinders.

The single-spark coil generates one ignition
spark per power stroke via the spark plug. 
It is thus necessary to synchronize operation
with the camshaft in these systems.

Dual-spark ignition coil
Single-spark ignition (one spark plug per
cylinder)
The dual-spark coil generates ignition volt-
age for two spark plugs simultaneously. 
The voltage is distributed to the cylinders 
in such a way that
(cid:2) The air/fuel mixture in the one cylinder 
is ignited at the end of the compression
stroke

(cid:2) The ignition spark in the other cylinder 
is generated during the valve overlap at
the end of the exhaust stroke

The dual-spark coil generates a spark for
every crankshaft rotation, corresponding 
to twice for each power stroke. This means

(cid:3)

Bosch coil designations

There is no compression within the cylinder
at the point of valve overlap, and the flash -
over voltage at the spark plug is therefore
very low. This “additional or maintenance
spark” therefore requires only very small
amounts of energy for flashover.

Dual-plug ignition
In ignition systems with two spark plugs per
cylinder, the ignition voltages generated by
one ignition coil are distributed to two dif-
ferent cylinders. The resulting advantages
are
(cid:2) Emissions reductions
(cid:2) A slight increase in power
(cid:2) Two sparks at different points in the 

combustion chamber

(cid:2) The option of using ignition offset to

achieve “softer” combustion

(cid:2) Good emergency-running characteristics
when one ignition coil fails due to a fault

Compact ignition coil
Design
The compact coil’s magnetic circuit consists
of the O core and the I core (Fig. 1), onto
which the primary and secondary windings
are plugged. This arrangement is installed 
in the coil housing. The primary winding 
(I core wound in wire) is
electrically and mechanically
connected to the primary
plug connection. Also con-
nected is the start of the sec-
ondary winding (coil body
wound in wire). The connec-
tion on 
the spark-plug side of the
secondary winding is also
 located in the housing, and
electrical contacting is estab-
lished when the windings 
are fitted.

Integrated within the

the contact section for

also a silicone jacket for
 insulating the high voltage
from external components
and the spark-plug well. 
Once the components

have been assembled,
 impregnating resin is vac-
uum-injected into the in-
side of the housing, where 
it is  allowed to harden.

Remote and COP versions
The ignition coil’s compact dimensions
make it possible to implement the design
shown above in Figure 1. This version is
called COP (Coil on Plug). The ignition 
coil is mounted directly on the spark plug,
thereby rendering additional high-voltage
connecting cables superfluous (Fig. 2a). 
This reduces the capacitive load on the coil’s
secondary winding. The reduction in the
number of components also increases oper-
ational reliability (no rodent bites in igni-
tion cables, etc.).

In the less common remote version, the
compact coils are mounted within the en-
gine compartment using screws. Attachment
lugs or an additional bracket are provided
for this purpose. The high-voltage connec-
tion is effected by means of a high-voltage
ignition cable from the coil to the spark
plug.

The COP and remote versions are virtu-
ally identical in design. However, the remote
version (mounted on the vehicle body) is
subject to fewer demands with regard to

temperature and vibration conditions due 
to the fact that it is exposed to fewer loads
and strains.

Other coil types
ZS 2 x 2
Rotating high-voltage distribution is being
gradually superseded by distributorless
 (stationary) voltage distribution. 

An uncomplicated means for converting
an engine model to distributorless distribu-
tion is offered by the ZS 2x2 (Fig. 3) and the
ZS 3x2 (German: Zündspule = ignition coil,
hence ZS). These ignition coils contain two
(or three) magnetic circuits, and generate
two sparks per circuit. They can thus be
used to replace the distributors in four- and
six-cylinder engines. Because the units can
be mounted almost anywhere in the engine
compartment, the vehicle manufacturer’s
adaptation effort is minimal, although the
engine ECU has to be modified. Another
factor is that high-voltage ignition cables 
are required in most cases for layouts with
remote ignition coils.

Ignition coils

Types

Ignition-coil modules
Ignition-coil modules combine several coils
in a shared housing to form a single assem-
bly (Fig. 4). These coils continue to operate
individually.

The advantages furnished by coil modules

are
(cid:2) Simplified installation (just a single oper-
ation for three or four ignition coils) 

(cid:2) Fewer threaded connections 
(cid:2) Connection to the engine wiring harness

with just one plug 

(cid:2) Cost savings thanks to faster installation

and simplified wiring harness

Disadvantages:
(cid:2) It is necessary to adapt the module’s
geometry to fit the engine, and

(cid:2) Modules must be designed to fit individ-
ual cylinder heads; no universal designs

Pencil coil
The pencil coil makes optimal use of the
space available within the engine compart-
ment. Its cylindrical shape makes it possible
to use the spark-plug well as a supplemen-
tary installation area for ideal space utiliza-
tion on the cylinder head (Fig. 5).

Because pencil coils are always mounted

directly on the spark plug, no additional
high-voltage connecting cables are required.

Design and magnetic circuit
Pencil coils operate like compact coils in
 accordance with the inductive principle.
However, the rotational symmetry results in
a design structure that differs considerably
from that of compact coils. 

Although the magnetic circuit consists 
of the same materials, the central rod core
(Fig. 6, Pos. 5) consists of laminations in
various widths stacked in packs that are
 virtually spherical. The yoke plate (9) that

provides the magnetic circuit is a rolled and
slotted shell – also in electrical sheet steel,
sometimes in multiple layers.

Another difference relative to compact
coils is the primary winding (7), which has a
larger diameter and is above the secondary
winding (6), while the body of the winding
also supports the rod core. This arrange-
ment brings benefits in the areas of design
and operation.

Design of pencil coil

Owing to restrictions imposed by their geo-
metrical configuration and compact dimen-
sions, pencil coils allow only limited scope
for varying the magnetic circuit (rod core,
yoke plate) and windings. 

In most pencil-coil applications, the lim-
ited space available dictates that permanent
magnets be used to increase the spark en-
ergy. 

The arrangements for electrical contact
with the spark plug and for connection to
the engine wiring harness are comparable
with those used for compact coils.

Variants
An extended range of variants (e.g., different
diameters and lengths) is available to pro-
vide pencil coils for assorted applications.
The ignition driver stage can also be inte-
grated within the housing as an option. 
A typical diameter, as measured at the
cylindrical center section (yoke plate, hous-
ing), is roughly 22 mm. This dimension is
derived from the hole diameter of the spark-
plug well within the cylinder head as used
with standard spark plugs featuring a 16 mm
socket fitting. The length of the pencil coil 
is determined by the installation space in 
the cylinder head and the required or poten-
tial electrical performance specifications.
 Extending the active section (transformer) 
is subject to limits, however, due to the
 parasitic capacitance and the deterioration
of the magnetic circuit involved.

Ignition coils

Ignition-coil electronics

Ignition-coil electronics

In earlier designs, the ignition driver stage
was usually incorporated within a separate
module, and attached to the coil or the dis-
tributor within the engine compartment of
a vehicle with rotating voltage distribution.
The conversion to distributorless ignition
combined with increasing miniaturization
of electronic componentry to foster the de-
velopment of ignition driver stages embed-
ded in integrated circuits and thus suitable
for incorporation in the ignition or engine
ECUs. 

The constantly increasing functional
scope of engine ECUs (Motronic) and new
engine concepts (e.g., gasoline direct injec-
tion) have increased thermal stresses (overall
heat loss from driver stages) and reduced in-
stallation space. These factors have produced
a trend toward remote driver stages located
outside the ECU. One option is integration
within the ignition coil, which also makes 
it possible to use a shorter primary wire to
reduce line loss.

The driver stage can be integrated in the
housing of both compact and pencil coils.
Figure 1 shows installation in a pencil coil. 
The driver-stage module – which can also
incorporate additional functions – is
mounted on a small printed-circuit board.
SMD (Surface Mounted Device) compo-
nents are used because of the restricted
 dimensions. 

The driver-stage transistors (7) are inte-

grated in standardized TO housings and
connected to the circuit board or conductor
rails. Additional functions for monitoring,
diagnosis or other functions (e.g., closed-
circuit current deactivation, customer-spe-
cific input circuit) can be optionally inte-
grated in further electronic components (3).
The primary connector (1) is connected di-
rectly to the circuit board. Below the board
are the contacts for the coil’s primary wind-
ing (4).

Electrical parameters

Electrical parameters

Inductance
Inductance is a physical variable which de-
notes the electromagnetic efficiency or self-
induction capability of a coil or, in general,
of an electrical conductor.

Inductance is determined by the material

and cross-section of the permeated mag-
netic circuit, the number of windings, and
the geometry of the copper winding.

An ignition coil includes primary and
 secondary inductance elements, with the
secondary inductance being many times
greater.

Capacitance
Three different types are encountered in an
ignition coil: inherent capacitance, parasitic
capacitance and load capacitance. Inherent
capacitance of an ignition coil is essentially
created by the winding itself. It is created
from the fact that neighboring wires within
the secondary winding form a capacitor. 

Parasitic capacitance is a “harmful” capac-
itance within an electrical system. Part of the
available or generated energy is needed to
charge or recharge this parasitic capacitor
and is therefore not available at the connec-
tions. In an ignition coil, parasitic capaci-
tance is created, for example, by the small

gap between the secondary and primary
windings or by cable capacitance between
ignition cable and neighboring components.
Load capacitance is essentially created by

the spark plug. It is determined by the in-
stallation environment (e.g., metallic spark-
plug well), the spark plug itself, and any
high-voltage connecting cables that may be
present. These factors are not usually subject
to modification and must be taken into con-
sideration in the design of the ignition coil.

Stored energy
The amount of magnetic energy that can be
stored depends upon numerous factors such
as the coil’s design (geometry, material in
the magnetic circuit, additional magnets)
and the ignition driver stage used. Once a
certain point is reached, any additional in-
creases in primary current will deliver only
minimal rises in stored energy, while losses
grow disproportionately, ultimately leading
to destruction of the coil within a short
 period of time. 

While taking into account all the toler-
ances, the ideal coil thus operates just below
the magnetic circuit’s magnetic saturation
point.

Resistance
The resistance of the windings is determined
by the temperature-sensitive specific resis-
tance of copper.

The primary resistance (resistance of the

primary winding) is normally within the
range of 0.4...0.7 Ω. It should not be too
high, because in the event of low vehicle
 system voltage (voltage dip during cold
starting) the ignition coil would not reach
its rated current, and would thus not be 
able to generate a lower spark energy. 

The secondary resistance (resistance of
the secondary winding) is in the range of
several kΩ; it differs from the primary resis-
tance in the larger number of turns on the
secondary winding (by a factor of 70...100)
and the small wire diameter (by a factor of
approximately 10). 

176

Ignition coils

Electrical parameters

Power loss
The losses in an ignition coil are determined
by resistance in the windings, capacitive
losses and remagnetization losses (hystere-
sis), as well as by construction-necessitated
deviations from the ideal configuration for 
a magnetic circuit. At an efficiency level of
50...60 %, relatively high power losses are
generated in the form of heat at high engine
speeds. The losses are kept as low as possible
by loss-minimized configurations, suitable
design solutions, and materials subject to
high thermal loads.

Turns ratio
The turns ratio is the ratio of the number of
turns in the primary copper winding to the
number in the secondary copper winding.
On standard ignition coils, it is on the order
of  1:50...1:150. Determination of the turns
ratio is used in combination with driver-
stage specifications to affect such factors 
as the level of spark current and – to some
degree – the maximum secondary voltage.

High-voltage and spark-generation
properties
The ideal coil remains relatively impervious
to load factors while producing as much
high voltage as possible within an extremely
brief rise period. These properties ensure
flashover at the spark plug for reliable mix-
ture ignition under all conditions encoun-
tered in operation. 

At the same time, the real-world proper-

ties of the windings, the magnetic circuit
and the driver stage used all unite to impose
limits on performance.

The polarity of the high voltage ensures
that the spark plug’s center electrode main-
tains negative potential relative to chassis
ground. This negative polarity counteracts
the tendency of the spark plug’s electrodes
to erode. 

Dynamic internal resistance
Yet another important parameter is the coil’s
dynamic internal resistance (impedance).
Because impedance combines with internal
and external capacitance to help determine
voltage rise times, it serves as an index of the
amount of energy that can flow from the
coil and through shunt-resistance elements
at the moment of flashover. Low internal
 resistance is an asset when spark plugs are
contaminated or wet. Internal resistance
 depends on secondary inductance. 

Ignition coils

Simulation-based development of ignition coils

177

Simulation-based
 development of 
ignition coils
Ever-increasing technical demands mean
that the efficiency limits of conventional de-
sign and development methods are reached
early. Product-development processes using
CAE provide a solution. CAE (Computer
Aided Engineering) is the generic term 
for computer-based engineering services. 
It includes all aspects of CAD (Computer
Aided Design) as well as calculation rou-
tines.

The advantages offered by CAE are: 
(cid:2) Informed decisions at early stages in the

development process (also without proto-
types)

(cid:2) Identification of specimens suitable for

(cid:2) Enhanced understanding of physical in-

testing, and

terrelationships

Calculation programs are employed in vari-
ous areas of simulation in ignition-coil de-
velopment:
(cid:2) Structural mechanics (analysis of me-
chanical and thermal stress factors) 

(cid:2) Fluid mechanics (analysis of fluidic charg-

ing processes)

(cid:2) Electromagnetics (analysis of the system’s

electromagnetic performance)

Electromagnetic simulation tools are espe-
cially important in the development ignition
coils. Two different types of simulation may
be used here: geometry-orientated simula-
tion and performance simulation.

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used
with geometry-orientated simulation. Here,
the coil’s geometry is modeled on the basis
of a CAD model. This is provided with ap-
propriate boundary conditions (current
density, electrical potential, etc.) and then
converted into an FEM model. Transfer to 
a calculation model and derivation of speci-
fications from the corresponding equation
series follow. The result is a clear calculated
solution to the problem.

This method permits 100 % virtual, simu-
lation-based ignition-coil design. Depending
on the analysis objective, it is possible here
to optimize the geometry of the ignition coil
(magnetic optimization of the magnetic cir-
cuit, electrostatic optimization of electrically
conductive contours).

Following geometry-orientated analysis,
performance simulation can be employed to
examine the coil’s electrical characteristics
within the overall system, consisting of dri-
ver stage, coil and spark plug, under condi-
tions reflecting the actual, real-world envi-
ronment. This calculation method provides
the initial specification data for the coil. 
It also supports subsequent calculation of
electrical parameters such as spark energy
and spark current.

Electromagnetic simulation tools make “vir-
tual” development of ignition coils possible.
The simulation results define geometrical
data and winding design to furnish the basis
for specimen construction. The electrical
performance of these specimen coils will
 approximate the simulation results. This
substantially reduces the number of time-
consuming recursion processes that occur
when coils are produced using conventional
product-development methods.

Spark plugs

Function

Spark plugs

The air/fuel mixture in the gasoline, or
spark-ignition, engine is ignited electrically.
Electrical energy drawn from the battery is
temporarily stored in the ignition coil for
this purpose. The high voltage generated
within the coil produces a flashover be-
tween the spark-plug electrodes in the en-
gine’s combustion chamber. The energy
contained in the spark then ignites the
 compressed air/fuel mixture.

Function

The function of the spark plug is to intro-
duce the ignition energy into the gasoline
engine’s combustion chamber and to pro-
duce a spark between the electrodes to initi-
ate combustion of the air/fuel mixture.

1

Spark plug in a gasoline engine

Spark plugs must be designed to ensure pos-
itive insulation between spark and cylinder
head while also sealing the combustion
chamber.

In combination with engine components,
such as the ignition and mixture-formation
systems, the spark plug plays a crucial role 
in determining operation of the gasoline
 engine. It must 
(cid:2) facilitate reliable cold starts, 
(cid:2) ensure consistent operation with no igni-
tion miss throughout its service life, and 
(cid:2) not overheat under extended operation 

at or near top speed.

To ensure this kind of performance
throughout the spark plug’s service life, 
the correct plug concept must be established
early in the engine-design process. Research
investigating the ignition process is em-

ployed to determine
the spark-plug
 concept that will
provide the best
emissions and most
consistent engine
operation.

An important
spark-plug parame-
ter is the heat range.
The right heat range
prevents the spark
plug from overheat-
ing and inducing
the thermal auto-
 ignition that could
lead to engine dam-
age.

Spark plugs

Usage

179

Usage

Areas of application
Bosch first used a spark plug in a passenger
car in 1902, when it was installed in a system
featuring magneto ignition. The spark plug
then went on to become an unparalleled
success in automotive technology.

Spark plugs are used in all vehicles and ma-
chinery powered by gasoline engines, both
2-stroke and 4-stroke. They can be found in
(cid:2) Passenger cars
(cid:2) Commercial vehicles
(cid:2) Single-track vehicles (motorcycles,
 scooters, motor-assisted bicycles)

(cid:2) Ships and small craft
(cid:2) Agricultural and construction machinery
(cid:2) Motor saws
(cid:2) Garden appliances (e.g., lawnmowers),

etc.

To accommodate the wide array of potential
applications, more than 1200 different spark
plug designs are available.

Because multi-cylinder passenger-car en-
gines require at least one plug per cylinder, 
it is in this sector that most spark plugs are
used. 

Motorized machinery, because of the
lower engine power, usually relies on a sin-
gle-cylinder engine needing only a single
spark plug. 

Within Europe, most commercial vehicles

– at least in heavy-duty applications – are
powered by diesel engines, which limits the
demand for spark plugs in this segment. 
In the US, however, gasoline engines are 
also the most prevalent powerplants in
heavy  vehicles.

Variety of types
The engine of 1902 delivered only about
6 HP for each 1000 cc of displacement.
 Today’s comparable figure is 100 HP, with 
up to 300 HP available from racing engines.
The technical resources invested in engi-
neering and producing the spark plugs 
that allow this performance is enormous. 

The first spark plug was expected to ignite

15 to 25 times per second. Today’s spark
plugs must ignite five times as often. The up-
per temperature limit as risen from 600 °C to
approximately 900 °C, and the  ignition volt-
age from 10,000 V to up to 30,000 V. Whereas
today’s spark plugs must function for at least
30,000 km, original spark plugs had to be
 replaced every 1000 km.

Although the spark plug’s basic concept has
changed little in the course of 100 years, in
this period Bosch has designed more than
20,000 different types to meet the needs of
various engine configurations. 

The current spark-plug range continues

to embrace a wide array of models. The
spark plug is subject to immense demands
in the areas of 
(cid:2) electrical and
(cid:2) mechanical performance, as well as
(cid:2) resistance to chemical and
(cid:2) thermal loads. 

In addition to satisfying these performance
criteria, the spark plug must also be matched
to the geometrical conditions defined by the
individual engine (e.g, spark-plug length 
in the cylinder head). Combined with the
extensive range of engines being manufac-
tured, these requirements make it necessary
to offer a wide variety of spark plugs. Bosch
currently supplies more than 1250 different
spark-plug types, all of which must be avail-
able to service workshops/garages and com-
mercial distributors.

180

Spark plugs

Requirements

The insulator must continue to display ade-
quate electrical resistance at up to 1000 °C
with only very minor diminution of this
 figure throughout its service life.

Mechanical-performance requirements
The spark plug must be capable of with-
standing periodic pressure peaks (up to
about 100 bar) in the combustion chamber,
while still providing an effective gas seal.
High resistance to mechanical stresses is also
required from the ceramic insulator, which
is exposed to loads during installation as
well as from the spark-plug connector and
the ignition cable itself during operation.
The shell must absorb the torque applied
during installation with no permanent
 deformation.

Chemical-performance requirements
Because the spark plug extends into a com-
bustion chamber hot enough to make its
nose glow red, it is exposed to the chemical
reactions that occur at extreme tempera-
tures. Substances within the fuel can form
aggressive residue deposits on the spark
plug, affecting its performance charac -
teristics.

Thermal-performance requirements
In operation the spark plug must alternately
absorb heat from hot combustion gases and
then withstand the cold incoming air/fuel
mixtures in rapid succession. This is why
 insulators must display immense resistance
to thermal shock.

The spark plug must also dissipate the
heat absorbed in the combustion chamber
to the engine’s cylinder head with maximum
efficiency; the terminal end of the spark plug
should remain as cool as possible.

Requirements

Electrical-performance requirements
During operation in electronic ignition
 systems, spark plugs must handle voltages 
as high as 30,000 V with no disruptive dis-
charge at insulator. Residue from the com-
bustion process, such as soot, carbon and
ash from fuel and oil additives, can be elec-
trically conductive under certain thermal
conditions. Yet under these same conditions
it remains imperative that flashover through
the insulator be avoided.

Design 

The essential components of the spark plug
are (Fig. 1)
(cid:2) Terminal stud (1) 
(cid:2) Insulator (2) 
(cid:2) Shell (3)
(cid:2) Seal seat (6), and 
(cid:2) Electrodes (8, 9) 

Terminal stud
The steel terminal stud is mounted gas-tight
in the insulator with an electrically conduc-
tive glass seal, which also establishes the con-
nection to the center electrode. The terminal
end protruding from the insulator features 
a thread for connecting the spark-plug con-
nector of the ignition cable. In the case of
connectors designed to ISO/DIN standards,
a terminal nut (with the required outer
 contour) is screwed onto the terminal-stud
thread, or the stud is equipped with a solid
ISO/DIN connection manufacture.

Insulator
The insulator is cast in a special ceramic ma-
terial. Its function is to insulate the center
electrode and terminal stud from the shell.
The demand for a combination of good
thermal conductivity and effective electrical
insulation is in stark contrast to the proper-
ties displayed by most insulating substances.
Bosch uses aluminum oxide (Al2O3) along
with minute quantities of other substances.
Following firing, this special ceramic meets
all requirements for mechanical and chemi-
cal durability, while its dense microstructure
provides high resistance to disruptive dis-
charge.

On air-gap spark plugs, the outer contour
of the insulator nose can also be modified to
improve heating for better response during
repeated cold starts.

The surface of the insulator’s terminal end 
is coated with a lead-free glaze. The glazing
helps prevent moisture and contamination
from adhering to the surface, which helps to
prevent tracking currents to a large extent.

Shell
The shell is manufactured from steel in 
a cold-forming process. The shell castings
emerge from the pressing tool with their
 final contours, limiting subsequent ma -
chining operations to just a few areas.

 surface

The bottom end of the shell includes threads
(Fig. 1, Pos. 7), making it possible to install
the plug in the cylinder head and then re-
move it after a specified replacement inter-
val. Depending on the specific design, as
many as four ground electrodes can be
welded to the end of the shell.

An electroplated nickel coating is applied

to the surface to protect the shell against
corrosion and prevent it from seizing in the
sockets of the aluminum cylinder heads.

To accommodate the spark plug-wrench,
the upper section of the conventional shell
has a 6-point socket fitting; newer shell
 designs may use a 12-point fitting. The 
12-point fitting makes it possible to reduce
the socket attachment’s size to 14 mm with-
out modifying insulator-head geometry.
This reduces the spark plug’s space demands
in the cylinder head and allows the engine
designer greater freedom in locating the
cooling passages.

The top end of the spark-plug shell is

flanged after the plug core (comprising insu-
lator with reliably mounted center electrode
and terminal stud) has been inserted, and
secures the plug core in position. The sub -
sequent shrink-fitting process – inductive
heating under high pressure – produces 
a gas-tight connection between insulator
and shell to ensure effective thermal con-
ductivity.

Seal seat
Depending on engine design, either a flat 
or conical seal seat (Fig. 2) effects the seal
between the spark plug and the cylinder
head.

In the case of a flat seal seat, a sealing ring
(1) is used as the sealing element. This cap-
tive sealing ring is permanently attached to
the spark-plug shell. Its special contours
adapt to form a durable yet flexible seal
when the spark plug is installed. In the case
of a conical seal seat, a conical, or tapered,
surface (2) on the spark-plug shell mates
 directly with the cylinder head to provide 
a seal without the use of a sealing ring.

Spark-plug life can be extended through the
use of greater end-surface areas and multiple
ground electrodes.

3

Electrode shapes

Electrodes
During flashover and high-temperature op-
eration, the electrode material is subjected to
such strong thermal load that the electrodes
become worn – the electrode gap widens 
accordingly. To satisfy demands for extended
replacement intervals, electrode materials
must effectively resist erosion (burning by
the spark) and corrosion (wear due to ag-
gressive thermochemical processes). These
properties are achieved primarily through
the use of temperature-resistant nickel
 alloys. 

Center electrode
The center electrode (Fig. 1, Pos. 8), which
includes a copper core for improved heat
dissipation, is anchored at one end in the
conductive glass seal. 

In “long-life” spark plugs, the center 
electrode serves as the base material for a
noble-metal pin, which is permanently 
connected to the base electrode by means 
of laser welding. Other spark plug designs
rely on electrodes formed from a single thin
platinum wire, which is then sintered to the
ceramic base for good thermal conductivity.

Ground electrodes
The ground electrodes (10) are attached 
to the shell and usually have quadrilateral
cross-sections. Available arrangements
 include the front electrode and the side
 electrode (Fig. 3b). The ground electrode’s
fatigue strength is determined by its thermal
conductivity. As with center electrodes, com-
posite materials can be used to improve heat
dissipation, but it is the length and the end
surface that will ultimately determine the
ground electrode’s temperature, and thus 
its resistance to wear.

Spark plugs

Electrode materials

Electrode materials

As a basic rule, pure metals conduct heat
better than alloys. Yet pure metals – such as
nickel – are also more sensitive than alloys to
chemical attack from combustion gases and
solid combustion residues. Manganese and
silicon can be added to nickel to produce al-
loys with enhanced resistance to aggressive
chemical, especially sulfur dioxide (SO2,
 sulfur is a constituent of lube oil and fuel).
Aluminum and yttrium additives enhance
resistance to scaling and oxidation.

Compound electrodes
Corrosion-resistant nickel alloys are now the
most widely used option in spark-plug man-
ufacture. A copper core can be used for fur-
ther increases in heat dissipation, producing
compound electrodes that satisfy exacting
demands for high thermal conductivity and
high corrosion resistance (Fig. 1).

The ground electrodes, which must be
flexible enough to bend when the gap is set,
may also be manufactured from a nickel-
based alloy or from a composite material.

Silver-center electrodes
Silver has the best electrical and thermal
conductivity of any material. It also displays
extreme resistance to chemical attack, pro-
vided that it is not exposed to either leaded
fuels or to high temperatures in reducing
 atmospheres (rich air/fuel mixture). 

Composite particulate materials with sil-
ver as their basic substance can substantially
enhance heat resistance.

Platinum electrodes
Platinum (Pt) and platinum alloys display
high levels of resistance to corrosion, oxida-
tion and thermal erosion. This is why plat-
inum is the substance of choice for use in
“long-life” spark plugs.

In some spark-plug types, the Pt pin is
cast in the ceramic body early in the manu-
facturing process. In the subsequent sinter-
ing process, the ceramic material shrinks
onto the Pt pin to permanently locate it in
the plug core.

In other spark-plug types, thin Pt pins 
are welded onto the center electrode (Fig. 2).
Bosch relies on continuous-operation lasers
to produce a durable bond.

Spark plugs

Spark-plug concepts

185

Spark-plug concepts

The mutual arrangement of the electrodes
and the locations of the ground electrodes
relative to the insulator determine the type
of spark-plug concept (Fig. 1).

Air-gap concept
Center and ground electrodes are configured
to produce a linear spark to ignite the air-
fuel mixture located within the space be-
tween them.

Surface-air-gap concepts
On these spark plugs, the ground electrodes
are arranged at a specific distance from the
center electrode and the end of the ceramic
insulator. This produces two alternate spark
paths, which facilitate both forms of dis-
charge – air gap and surface-air gap – and
different ignition-voltage-demand values.
Depending on operating conditions and
spark-plug condition (wear), the spark
 travels as an air-gap or surface-air-gap
spark.

Surface-gap concept
As a result of the defined position of the
ground electrodes relative to the ceramic,
the spark travels initially from the center
electrode across the surface of the insulator
nose before jumping across a gas-filled gap
to the ground electrode. Because the igni-
tion voltage required to produce discharge
across the surface is less than that needed to
produce discharge across an air gap of equal
dimensions, a surface-gap spark can bridge
wider electrode gaps than an air-gap spark
with an identical ignition-voltage demand.
This produces a larger flame core for more
effective creation of a stable flame front.

The surface-gap spark also promotes self-

cleaning during repeated cold starts, pre-
venting soot deposits from forming on the
insulator nose. This improves performance
on engines exposed to frequent cold starts 
at low temperatures.

Spark plugs

Electrode gap

Electrode gap

As the shortest distance between the center
and ground electrodes, the electrode gap
 determines, among others, the length of the
spark (Fig. 1). The smaller the electrode 
gap, the lower the voltage that is required 
to generate an ignition spark. 

An excessively small gap produces only 
a small flame core in the electrode area. Be-
cause this flame core loses energy through
the electrode contact surfaces (quenching),
the rate at which the flame core propagates
is only very slow. Under extreme conditions,
the energy loss can be high enough to pro-
duce ignition miss.

As electrode gaps increase (e.g., due to
electrode wear), lower quenching losses lead
to improved conditions for ignition, but
larger gaps also increase the ignition-voltage
demand (Fig. 2). The reserves afforded by
any given level of ignition voltage in the
 ignition coil are reduced and the danger 
of  ignition miss increases.

Engine manufacturers use various test pro-
cedures to determine the ideal electrode gap
for each engine. The first step is to conduct
ignition tests at characteristic engine operat-
ing points to determine the minimum elec-
trode gap. Salient considerations include
 exhaust emissions, smooth operation and
fuel consumption. 

In subsequent extended test runs, the
wear performance of these spark plugs is
 determined and then evaluated with regard
to ignition-voltage demand. The specified
electrode gap is then defined at a point pro-
viding an adequate safety margin to the 
miss limit. Gap specifications are quoted 
in vehicle owner’s manuals as well as in
Bosch spark-plug sales documentation. 

Bosch spark plugs are set to the correct
 electrode gap at the factory.

tion is not always uniform, with isolated
misses or delayed combustion occurring in
extreme situations.

Comparison of the two diagrams indi-
cates that on this engine projecting the spark
position further into the combustion cham-
ber would substantially improve ignition, 
as the ignition-timing range increases above
the 5 % curve and the operating limit is
pushed toward higher excess-air factors.
However, extending the length of the
ground electrodes leads to higher tempera-
tures, which in turn produce rises in elec-
trode wear. The self-resonant frequency also
falls, which can lead to ruptures and fissures
from vibration. When the spark position is
shifted forward, a number of other measures
are needed to ensure adequate service life:
(cid:2) Extending the spark-plug shell inward
 beyond the combustion-chamber wall.
The shoulder reduces the danger of
 electrode rupture.

(cid:2) Inserting copper cores into the ground
electrodes. Placing copper in direct con-
tact with the spark-plug shell can reduce
temperatures by approximately. 70 °C. 

(cid:2) Using highly heat-resistant electrode

 materials.

Spark position

The spark position (Fig. 1a) is the location
of the spark gap relative to the walls of the
combustion chamber. Spark position has a
substantial effect on combustion in modern
engines (especially direct-injection engines).
The criterion for defining the quality of the
combustion process is the engine’s operating
consistency, or smoothness, which is in turn
based on a statistical evaluation of the indi-
cated mean effective pressure. The extent of
the standard deviation or of the variation
coefficient (cov = s/pime · 100 [%]) is an in-
dex of the uniformity of the combustion.
These values also provide information on
any major effects that delayed or missed
combustion will have on engine operation.
A value of 5 % is defined for cov as the 
measure of the operation limit. 

Figure 1 illustrates the effects of leaning
out the air/fuel mixture and varying ignition
timing on operational consistency at two
different spark-plug positions. The lines
 describe constant consistency levels, while
the 5 % limit is shown in bold blue. Values
above this curve (< 5 % range) correlate with
smooth engine operation – the combustion
process of the individual working cycles is
uniform and free from major fluctuations.
Values below this curve (> 5 % range) corre-
spond to poor engine operation – combus-

Spark plugs

Spark-plug heat range

Spark-plug heat range

Spark-plug operating temperatures
Operating range
Engines run on a rich air/fuel mixture 
when cold. This can lead to incomplete
combustion and formation of soot deposits
on spark plugs and combustion-chamber
surfaces. These deposits contaminate the in-
sulator nose to form a partially conductive
link between the center electrode and the
spark-plug shell (Fig. 1). This “shunting”
 effect allows a portion of the ignition energy
to escape as “shunt current”, reducing the
overall energy available for ignition. 
As contamination increases, so does the
probability that no spark will be produced.
The tendency for combustion residues to
form deposits on the insulator nose is heav-
ily dependent on its temperature and takes
place predominantly at temperatures below
approximately. 500 °C. At higher tempera-
tures, the carbon-based residues are burned
from the insulator nose, i.e., the spark plug
cleans itself.

The objective is therefore to heat the insula-
tor nose to an operating temperature which
is above the “self-cleaning limit” of roughly
500 °C (for unleaded fuel) and is obtained
shortly after starting.

An upper temperature limit of approxi-

mately 900 °C should not be exceeded.
Above this limit, the electrodes are subject 
to heavy wear due to oxidation and hot-gas
corrosion. 

If temperatures rise even further, the risk
of auto-ignition can no longer be ruled out
(Fig. 2). In this process, the air/fuel mixture
ignites on the hot spark-plug components to
produce uncontrolled ignition events; these
can damage or even destroy the engine.

Thermal loading capacity
When the engine is running, the spark plug
is heated by the temperatures generated in
the combustion process. Some of the heat
absorbed by the spark plug is dissipated to
the fresh gas. Most is conducted via the cen-
ter electrode and the insulator to the spark-
plug shell, from which point it is dissipated
to the cylinder head (Fig. 3). The ultimate

properties can vary over the course of time.
One example is the potential increase in
compression ratio caused by ash deposits 
in the combustion chamber, which in turn
results in higher temperatures for the spark
plug. If no malfunctions occur with sooted
spark plugs in the subsequent cold-starting
tests with this heat-range recommendation,
then the correct heat range for the engine is
determined. 

Because vehicle engines display a wide range
of different properties with regard to operat-
ing loads, method of operation, compres-
sion, engine speed, cooling and fuel, it is
 impossible to use just one spark plug for all
engines. A plug that overheats in one engine
would run at relatively cold temperatures in
another.

operating temperature is the point at which
absorption of heat from the engine and its
dissipation to the cylinder head reach a state
of equilibrium. 

The amount of heat supplied is dependent
on the engine. Engines with high specific
power output generally operate with higher
combustion-chamber temperatures than
those with low specific power output.

The design of the insulator nose is the
 primary determinant of heat dissipation.
The size of the insulator surface determines
heat absorption, while the cross-sectional
area and the center electrode affect heat
 dissipation. 

The spark plug’s heat-absorption capacity
must therefore be matched to the individual
engine type. The index indicating a spark
plug’s thermal loading capacity is its heat
range.

Heat range and heat-range 
code  number
The heat range of a spark plug is determined
relative to calibration spark plugs and de-
scribed with the aid of a heat-range code
number. A low code number (e.g., 2...5)
 indicates a “cold” spark plug with low heat
absorption through a short insulator nose. 
A high code number (e.g., 7...10) indicates a
“hot” spark plugs with high heat absorption
through a long insulator nose. These code
numbers form an integral part of the spark-
plug designation so that spark plugs with
different heat ranges can be easily distin-
guished and allocated to different engines. 
The correct heat range is determined in
full-load measurements because it is at these
very operating points that thermal loading
of spark plugs is at its greatest. During oper-
ation, the spark plugs should never become
so hot as to represent a source of thermal
auto-ignition. The heat-range recommenda-
tion is always defined with a safety margin
relative to this auto-ignition limit to accom-
modate production variations in both plugs
and engines. This margin is also important
in view of the fact that an engine’s thermal

Adaptation of spark plugs

Adaptation of spark plugs

Bosch works together with engine manufac-
turers in jointly defining the ideal spark
plugs for each engine. 

Temperature measurement
Thermocouple spark plugs specially de-
signed and produced for temperature moni-
toring (Fig. 1) provide initial information
on the right choice of plug. A thermocouple
(2) embedded in the center electrode (3)
makes it possible to record the temperatures
in the individual cylinders as a function of
engine speed and load. This process repre-
sents a simple means of identifying the
hottest cylinder and operating conditions
for subsequent measurements as well as
 assisting in reliable designation of the
 correct plug for any specific application.

Thermocouple spark plug

Ionic-current measurement
The Bosch ionic-current measurement
 procedure employs the combustion process
as a factor for determining the heat-range
requirement. The ionizing effect of flames
enables the progress in terms of time of
combustion to be assessed by measuring 
the conductivity in the spark gap (Fig. 2).
Because the electrical ignition spark pro-
duces a large number of charged particles in
the spark gap, the ionic current rises sharply
at the moment of ignition. Although the
current flow falls once the ignition coil is
discharged, the number of charged particles
maintained by the combustion process is
large enough to allow continued monitor-
ing. Simultaneous monitoring of combus-
tion-chamber pressure provides a record 
of normal combustion with a uniform pres-
sure increase, peaking after ignition TDC. 
If the spark plug’s heat range is varied dur-
ing these measurements, the combustion
process displays characteristic shifts with 
the thermal loading of a spark plug as a
function of the heat range (Fig. 4).

Adaptation of spark plugs

The advantage of this method over measure-
ments focusing exclusively on temperatures
in the combustion chamber is that it indi-
cates ignition probability, which is depen-
dent not only on temperature, but also on
the design parameters of the engine and 
the spark plug.

Definition of terminology
Terminology and definitions for uncon-
trolled ignition of air/fuel mixtures for heat-
range adaptation of spark plugs have been
defined in an international agreement 
(ISO 2542 – 1972, Fig. 3).

Thermal auto-ignition
Auto-ignition is defined as a process that
 results in ignition of the air/fuel mixture
without an ignition spark, usually starting
on a hot surface (e.g., on the excessively hot
insulator-nose surface of a spark plug with
too high a heat range). These events can be
classified in one of two categories, according
to the point at which they occur relative to
the moment of ignition.

Spark plugs

Adaptation of spark plugs

Post-ignition
Post-ignition occurs after the moment 
of electrical ignition, but is not a critical
 factor in practical engine operation in that
electrical ignition always takes place earlier.
 Conducting measurements to determine
whether the spark plug is producing thermal
auto-ignition entails suppressing the electri-
cal spark. When post-ignition occurs, the
sharp rise in ionic current does not occur
until after the moment of ignition. But,
 because it initiates a combustion process, 
a pressure rise and therefore a torque 
output are also registered (Fig. 4b).

Pre-ignition
Pre-ignition occurs before the moment of
electrical ignition (Fig. 4c) and can cause
 serious engine damage due to its uncon-
trolled progression. Premature initiation of
the combustion process shifts the pressure
peak relative to TDC while also increasing
maximum pressure levels in the combustion
chamber, promoting additional thermal 
load on the components in the combustion
chamber. It is thus essential when adapting
spark plugs to ensure that no pre-ignition
will take place.

Assessment of measurement results
The Bosch ionic-current measurement pro-
cedure can be used to detect both types.
However, the ignition spark must be sup-
pressed at specific intervals for the purpose
of detecting post-ignition. The point at
which post-ignition occurs relative to the
moment of ignition combines with the
 percentage of post-ignition events relative 
to the scan rate to provide information on
the stresses to which the spark plug is being
 subjected within the engine. Because spark
plugs with extended insulator noses (hot
spark plugs) absorb more heat from the
combustion chamber and dissipate that heat
less effectively, they are more likely to induce
post-ignition or even pre-ignition than
spark plugs with shorter insulator noses.
The application measurements employed 
to select the correct heat range for the

 respective engine thus rely on mutual com-
parisons of spark plugs with various heat
ranges and analysis of their tendency to
 produce pre-ignition or post-ignition. 

The preferred environments for conduct-
ing spark-plug adaptation measurements are
thus the engine test stand and the chassis
 dynamometer. For reasons of safety, mea-
surement test runs to determine the hottest
operating point at full load over an extended
period of time on public highways are not
permitted.

Spark-plug selection
The object of an adaptation is to select a
spark plug which can be operated without
pre-ignition and which has an adequate
heat-range reserve, i.e., pre-ignition should
not occur with spark plugs that are not hot-
ter by at least two heat-range numbers. 
As this section has indicated, selection

and use of spark plugs is a finely-tuned
process. The procedure for choosing the
ideal spark plug generally includes close
 cooperation between the spark-plug man -
ufacturer and the engine manufacturer.

Spark plugs

Spark-plug performance

Spark-plug performance

Changes in the course of service life
Because spark plugs operate within an ag-
gressive atmosphere, sometimes at extremely
high temperatures, electrodes are subject to
wear, which increases the ignition-voltage
demand. When the situation finally reaches
the point at which the ignition-voltage de-
mand can no longer be covered by the igni-
tion coil, then ignition misses occur.

Spark-plug operation can also be detri-
mentally affected by changes in an aging en-
gine and by contamination. As engines age,
blowby and leakage increase, raising the
amount of oil in the combustion chamber.
This, in turn, leads to more deposits of soot,
ash and carbon on the spark plug, which can
give rise to shunting, ignition misses, and in
extreme cases auto-ignition. Yet another fac-
tor is the use of antiknock additives in fuels,

Wear on center and ground electrodes

which can form deposits, become conduc-
tive at high temperatures, and produce hot
shunts. The ultimate result is ignition miss,
characterized by a substantial increase in
pollutant emissions along with potential
damage to the catalytic converter. This is
why spark plugs should be replaced at
 regular intervals.

Electrode wear
Electrode wear is synonymous with elec-
trode erosion, a material loss which causes
the gap to grow substantially over the course
of time. This phenomenon essentially arises
from two sources:
(cid:2) Spark erosion, and
(cid:2) Corrosion in the combustion chamber

Spark erosion and corrosion
Flashover of electrical sparks causes the
 electrodes to heat up to their melting point.
The minute, microscopic particles deposited
on surfaces react with the oxygen or the
other constituents of the combustion gases.
This results in material erosion, widening
the electrode gap and raising the ignition-
voltage demand (Fig. 1).

Electrode wear is minimized by using
 materials with high temperature stability
(e.g., platinum and platinum alloys). It is
also possible to reduce erosion without
 limiting service life using suitable electrode
geometry (e.g., smaller diameter, thin pins)
and alternate spark-plug designs (surface-
gap plugs). 

The electrical resistance effected in the
conductive glass seal also reduces erosion
and wear.

Abnormal operating states
Abnormal operating states can destroy both
the spark plugs and the engine.
Such states include:
(cid:2) Auto-ignition
(cid:2) Combustion knock, and
(cid:2) High oil consumption (ash and carbon

deposits)

Spark-plug performance

Engine and spark plugs can also be damaged
by incorrect ignition-system settings, spark
plugs with the wrong heat range for the en-
gine, and unsuitable fuels.

Auto-ignition
Auto-ignition is an uncontrolled ignition
process accompanied by increases in com-
bustion-chamber temperatures severe
enough to cause serious damage to both
spark plugs and engine.

Full-load operation can produce localized

hot spots and induce auto-ignition in the
following areas:
(cid:2) At the spark-plug’s insulator nose
(cid:2) On exhaust valves
(cid:2) On protruding sections of cylinder-head

gaskets, and 

(cid:2) On flaking deposits

Combustion knock
Knocking is characteristic of an uncon-
trolled combustion process with very sharp
rises in pressure. Knock is caused by sponta-
neous ignition of the mixture in areas which
the advancing flame front, initiated by the
usual electrical spark, has not yet reached.
Combustion proceeds at a considerably
faster rate than normal. High-frequency
pressure pulsations with extreme pressure
peaks are then superimposed on the normal
pressurization curve (Fig. 3). The severe
pressure gradients expose components
(cylinder head, valves, pistons and spark
plugs) to extreme thermal loads capable of
damaging one or numerous components. 
The damage is similar to that associated
with cavitation damage from ultrasonic flow
currents. On the spark plug, pitting on the
ground electrode’s surface is the first sign 
of combustion knock.

SUPER spark plug
SUPER spark plugs (Fig. 1) make up the
 majority of the Bosch spark-plug range, 
and serve as the basis for various derivative
spark-plug types and concepts. A suitable
version with precisely the right heat range 
is available for virtually every engine and
 application.

A cutaway view of the SUPER spark plug

is shown in the section entitled “Design”
(Fig. 1). The most significant characteristics
of the SUPER spark plug are: 
(cid:2) A composite center electrode consisting 
of nickel-chromium alloy and featuring 
a copper core 

(cid:2) Optionally, a composite ground electrode
for reducing ground-electrode wear by
 reducing the maximum temperature at
the electrode, and

(cid:2) An electrode gap that is preset for the

 relevant engine the factory

Various spark-plug profiles are employed 
to satisfy specific individual demands. 
The spark plug illustrated in Figure 2b is 
a current version that varies in a number 
of details from the classic SUPER (Fig. 2a).
The spark position projects further into the
combustion chamber, while optimized insu-
lator-nose geometry and a thinner center
electrode offer improved performance in
 repeated cold starts. 

The version in Figure 2c features a laser-
welded noble-metal pin. This not only ex-
tends service life, but also improves ignition
and flame propagation thanks to its small
diameter.

Design
The special features that distinguish the
Bosch SUPER 4 spark plug from conven-
tional SUPER plugs include
(cid:2) Four symmetrically arranged ground

 electrodes (Fig. 3)

(cid:2) A preset electrode gap requiring no ad-
justment during the plug’s service life

Spark-plug efficiency
The SUPER 4’s thin ground electrodes ab-
sorb less energy from the ignition spark than
the electrodes on conventional spark plugs.
The SUPER 4 thus offers higher operating
efficiency by providing up to 40 % more en-
ergy to ignite the air/fuel mixture (Fig. 5).

Ignition probability
Higher excess air (lean mixture, λ > 1) re-
duces the probability that the energy trans-
ferred to the gas will be sufficient to ignite
the mixture reliably. In laboratory tests, the
SUPER 4 has demonstrated the ability to
 ignite reliably mixtures as lean as λ = 1.55,
whereas more than half of all ignition at-
tempts failed under these conditions when 
a standard spark plug was used (Fig. 5). 

Performance in repeated cold starts
Surface-gap sparking ensures effective  
self-cleaning, even at low temperatures. 
This means that up to three times as many
cold starts (starting without warming up 
the  engine) are possible as with conven-
tional plugs. 

Method of operation
The four ground electrodes are manufactured
from a thin profile section to ensure good ig-
nition and flame-front propagation. The de-
fined gap separating them from the center
electrode and the insulator nose allows the
spark – depending on the operating condi-
tions – to jump either as an air-gap spark or
as a surface-air-gap spark. The result is a total
of eight potential spark gaps. Which of these
spark gaps is selected is dependent on the
 operating conditions and the density of the
air/fuel mixture at the moment of ignition.

Uniform electrode wear
Because the probability of spark propaga-
tion is the same for all electrodes, the sparks
are evenly distributed across the insulator
nose. In this way, even the wear is evenly
 distributed across all four electrodes. 

Operating range
The silver-plated center electrode provides
effective heat dissipation. This reduces the
risk of auto-ignition due to overheating 
and extends the safe operating range. These
assets mean that each SUPER 4 has a heat
range corresponding to at least two ranges 
in a conventional spark plug. In this way, a
wide range of vehicles can be refitted during
servicing with relatively few spark-plugs
types.

Ignition reliability
The extended electrode gap of 1.6 mm lends
the Platinum+4 the capacity to deliver out-
standingly reliable ignition, while the four
earth electrodes assume an ideal position 
in the combustion chamber to ensure that
the ignition spark has unobstructed access
to the mixture. This allows the flame core 
to spread into the combustion chamber with
virtually no interference, ensuring complete
ignition of the entire air/fuel mixture.

by a host of properties which make it ideal
for extended-duty applications:

nents extend the plug-replacement inter-
vals to up to 100,000 km

Response to repeated cold starts
The surface-gap concept provides substan-
tial improvements over air-gap plugs in
 repeated cold starting. 

Electrode wear
There are also advantages in respect of elec-
trode wear, thanks to the erosion-resistant
platinum pin in the center electrode and
 improved materials in the four ground elec-
trodes. The resistance in the conductive 
glass seal reduces capacitive discharge,
 making a further contribution to reduced
spark  erosion.

The comparison in Figure 7 shows the rise in
demand for ignition energy over a period of
engine operation of 800 hours on an engine
test stand (corresponding to 100,000 km of
highway use). The Platinum+4 spark plug’s
lower electrode wear delivers substantial
 reductions in the rate at which voltage
 demand increases relative to conventional
spark plugs. Figures 8 and 9 show the pro-
files of a Platinum+4 spark plug when 
new and after a period of engine operation
of 800 hours; the minimal electrode wear at
the end of the endurance test is clear to see.

Types

Spark plugs for direct-injection 
gasoline engines
In direct-injection engines, the fuel is intro-
duced in stratified-charge mode via the
high-pressure injector directly into the com-
bustion chamber during the compression
stroke. The design of the intake manifold
and the piston crown generates a swirl- or
tumble-like charge movement with which
the fuel is transported to the spark plug.
 Because both the mass and direction of the
flow vary at the engine’s different operating
points, a spark position projecting far into
the combustion chamber is very advanta-
geous to mixture ignition. This forward-
spark concept has a negative effect on the
temperature of the ground electrode to the
extent that measures need to be take to re-
duce the temperature. By extending the shell
into the combustion chamber, it is possible
to reduce further the length of the ground
electrode and thereby its temperature so that
workable spark-plug concepts are possible. 
Because of the numerous possible spark

gaps, surface-gap concept offer a greater
 degree of reliability with regard to ignition
misses. The improved self-cleaning perfor-

10

Spark plugs for direct-injection gasoline engines

mance by the surface-gap spark marks this
spark-plug concept out for the wall- and  
air-guided combustion processes. 

If the flow velocity at the spark location is
not too great, even air-gap plugs can deliver
good ignition results. This is because 
(cid:2) The spark is not so sharply deflected 
(cid:2) Breakaway and re-ignition are avoided,

and 

(cid:2) The ignition energy can be transferred to

generate a stable flame core

In the wall- and air-guided combustion
processes, stratified mixture formation is
closely linked to piston stroke to the extent
that adjustment of combustion to the opti-
mum efficiency cannot always be guaran-
teed. In addition, soot is caused by the inten-
sive contact of the spray with the cylinder
wall and the piston. For this reason, com-
bustion processes which do not manifest
these disadvantages have taken hold in re-
cent years. By injecting the fuel during the
induction stroke, the air/fuel mixture is set
to λ = 1 and the engine is operated under
homogeneous conditions. The homoge-
neous combustion processes place similar

demands on the ignition performance of 
the spark plugs, as is the case with manifold-
injection engines. However, these engines
are often operated with exhaust-gas tur-
bochargers in order to achieve higher power
figures, i.e., at the moment of ignition the
air/fuel mixture has a higher density and
therefore also a higher ignition-voltage de-
mand. Here, air-gap plugs with noble-metal
pins are generally used on the center elec-
trode in order to be able to reliably satisfy
the service-life requirements after 60,000 km
and more.

Spray-guided combustion processes
In contrast, the demands placed on spark
plugs are significantly greater in more recent
developments pertaining to spray-guided
combustion processes. Due to the fact that
the spark plug is located close to the fuel
 injector, long, narrow plugs are preferred
 because this shape allows addition cooling
passages to be accommodated between the
injector and the spark plug. The alignment
of the spark plug to the injector must be
 determined in extensive tests. In this way,
the spark is drawn into the peripheral area
of the spray by the flow of the injection jet
 (entrainment flows), and thereby ignition 
of the mixture is ensured.

In these combustion processes, it is ex-
tremely important for the spark always to
jump at the same location. By configuring
the geometry of the spark plugs on the
 combustion-chamber side, it possible to
 prevent the spark from disappearing in 
the breathing space (air space between the
spark-plug shell and the insulator on the
combustion-chamber side) so that it re-
mains available for ignition. But reversing
the ignition polarity (center electrode as the
anode, ground electrode as the cathode) is
another way of avoiding surface-gap spark-
ing into the spark-plug shell (Fig. 11). It is
also necessary to check whether restricted
axial/radial position tolerances are needed 
in order to reduce the reciprocal action
 between the injector and the spark plug. 

If the spark plug is situated too closely to the
injector, the peripheral zone of the spray will
not yet be sufficiently prepared such that ig-
nition problems may arise due to over-rich
mixture zones. If the spark plug is situated
too far away from the injector, this may al-
ready give rise in the peripheral zones of the
spray to leaning-out effects, which in turn
are not conducive to a stable ignition phase.
In the case of a close spray-cone tolerance,
it is also necessary to keep the spark location
constant. If the spark position is too deep,
the spark plug projects into the spray and is
saturated with fuel; this may cause damage
to the spark plug and sooting on the insula-
tor. If the spark position is pulled back too
far towards the combustion-chamber wall,
the spray might no longer be drawn into the
mixture by the spray-induced flow, resulting
in ignition misses. 

From this, it is possible to deduce that
close coordination and cooperation is re-
quired between the design engineers respon-
sible for spark-plug development and com-
bustion-process in order to ensure reliable
functioning in the spray-guided combustion
processes.

Spark plugs

Types

Special-purpose spark plugs
Applications
Special-purpose spark plugs are available 
for use in certain applications. These plugs
feature unique designs dictated by the oper-
ating conditions and installation environ-
ments in individual engines.

Spark plugs for motor-sport applications
Constant full-load operation subjects the
engines in competition vehicles to extreme
thermal loads. The spark plugs produced for
this operating environment usually have no-
ble-metal electrodes (silver, platinum) and a
short insulator nose. The heat absorption of
these spark plugs is very low through the in-
sulator nose, while heat dissipation through
the center electrode is high (Fig. 12).

Spark plugs with resistors
A resistor can be installed in the supply line
to the spark plug’s spark gap to suppress
transmission of interference pulses to the

 ignition cable and thereby educe interfer-
ence radiation. The reduced current in 
the ignition spark’s arcing phase also leads
to lower electrode erosion. The resistor is
formed by the special conductive glass seal
between the center electrode and the termi-
nal stud. Appropriate additives lend the
 conductive glass seal the desired level of
 resistance.

Fully-shielded spark plugs
Shielded spark plugs may be required in
 applications characterized by extreme de-
mands in the area of interference suppres-
sion (radio equipment, car phones).

In fully shielded spark plugs, the insulator

is surrounded by a metal shielding sleeve.
The connection is inside the insulator. 
A union nut attaches the shielded ignition
cable to the sleeve. Fully shielded spark plugs
are also watertight (Fig. 13).

Spark plugs

Manufacture of spark plugs

Manufacture of spark plugs 

Each day roughly one million spark plugs
emerge from our Bamberg plant, the only
Bosch facility manufacturing these products
within Europe. Spark plugs conforming to
the universal Bosch quality standards are
also produced for local markets and origi-
nal-equimpent customers in plants in India,
Brazil, China, and Russia. Bosch has now
produced a total of more than seven billion
spark plugs.

The individual components joined to
form the finished spark plug in final assem-
bly are created in three parallel manufactur-
ing processes. 

Insulator
The basic material used in the high-quality
ceramic insulator is aluminum oxide. Aggre-
gate materials and binders are added to this
aluminum oxide, which is then ground to 
a fine consistency. The granulate is poured
into molds and processed at high pressure.
This gives the raw castings their internal
shape. The outer contours are ground to
produce the soft core, which already displays
a strong similarity to the later plug core. 
The next work step involves mechanically
anchoring a platinum pin only a few mil-
limeters in length in the soft core. The ce-
ramic elements pass through a sintering
 furnace, where they obtain their final shape
at a temperature of approximately 1600 °C, 
and the platinum pins are secured in the ce-
ramic element. The soft core must be manu-
factured to compensate for the contraction
that occurs in the sintering process, which is
approximately 20 %. 

Once the insulators have been fired, 
the labeling is applied to the insulator nose,
which is then coated with a lead-free glaze.

Plug core
Electrical contacting with the platinum pin
is effected by means of a contact pin, which
is flattened at the rear end. This blade en-
sures subsequent secure anchoring in the
plug core. Paste is filled into the hole once
the center electrode has been inserted into
the insulator. The paste consists of glass
 particles, to which conductive particles are
added to produce a conductive connection
to the terminal stud after sealing in. The in-
dividual components can also be varied to
manipulate the paste’s resistance. Resistance
values of up to 10 k⏐  can be achieved. 

The terminal stud is manufactured from

wire and formed by flattening and edge
knurling. It receives a protective nickel
 surface and is inserted in the plug core. 
The plug core then passes through an oven,
where it is heated to over 850 °C. The paste
becomes molten at these temperatures. 
It flows around the center electrode and 
the terminal stud can then be pressed into
this molten mass. The core cools to form a
gas-tight and electrically conductive connec-
tion between the center electrode and the
terminal stud.

Shell
The shell is manufactured from steel by
means of extrusion. A section several cen-
timeters in length is cut from the wire and
then cold-formed in several pressing opera-
tions until the spark-plug shell assumes its
final contours. Only a limited number of
machining operations (to produce shrinkage
and threaded sections) is then required.
 After the ground electrodes (up to four,
 depending on spark-plug type) have been
welded to the shell, the thread is rolled and
the entire shell is nickel-plated for protec-
tion against corrosion. 

Spark plugs

Manufacture of spark plugs

205

Spark-plug assembly
During spark-plug assembly, a sealing ring
and the plug core are installed in the spark-
plug shell. The upper shell is crimped and
beaded to position the plug core. A subse-
quent shrinking process (induction is used
to heat parts of the spark-plug shell to over
900 °C) provides a gas-tight union between
spark-plug shell and core. Then an outer
sealing ring is mounted on flat-seat spark
plugs in an operation that reshapes the
 material to form a captive seal washer. 
This ensures that the combustion chamber
will be effectively sealed when the spark plug
is subsequently installed in a cylinder head.

Spark plugs

Simulation-based spark-plug development

Simulation-based spark-plug
development 

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a
mathematical approximation procedure for
solving differential equations which describe
the behavior and properties of physical sys-
tems. The process entails dividing structures
into individual sectors, or finite elements. 

In spark-plug design, FEM is employed to
calculate temperature fields, electrical fields,
and problems of structural mechanics. It
makes it possible to determine the effects of
changes to a spark plug’s geometry and con-
stituent materials, and variations in general
environmental conditions, in advance, with-
out extensive testing. The results provide the
basis for precisely focused production of test
samples which are then used for verification
of the calculation results.

Temperature field
The maximum temperatures of the ceramic
insulator and the center electrode in the
combustion chamber are decisive factors for
the spark plug’s heat range. Figure 1a shows
an axisymmetrical model of a spark plug
along with a section of the cylinder head.

The temperature fields as indicated in the
colored sections show that the highest tem-
peratures occur at the nose of the ceramic
insulator.

Electrical field
The high voltage applied at the moment of
ignition is intended to generate flashover at
the electrodes. Breakdown in the ceramic
material or current tracking between the
 ceramic insulator and the spark-plug shell
can lead to delayed combustion and ignition
misses. Figure 1b shows an axisymmetrical
model with the corresponding field-strength
vectors between center electrode and shell.
The electrical field penetrates the noncon-
ductive ceramic material and the intermedi-
ate gas. 

Structural mechanics
High pressures within the combustion
chamber during combustion make a gas-
tight union between the spark-plug shell
and the insulator essential. Figure 1c shows
an axisymmetrical model of a spark plug
 after the shell is crimped and heat-shrunk.
The retention force and the mechanical
stress in the spark-plug shell are measured.

mended only on spark plugs with front elec-
trodes. Because this would involve actually
changing the spark-plug concept, the gaps 
of the ground electrodes on surface-gap and
surface-air-gap spark plugs should never be
readjusted.

Removal
The first step is to screw out the spark plug
by several thread turns. The spark-plug well
is then cleaned using compressed air or a
brush to prevent dirt particles from becom-
ing lodged in the cylinder head threads or
entering the combustion chamber. It is only
after this operation that the spark plug
should be completely unscrewed and
 removed.

To avoid damaging the threads in the
cylinder head, respond to any tendency to
seize in spark plugs by unscrewing them by
only a small amount. Then apply oil or a
solvent containing oil to the threads and
screw the spark plug back in. Wait for the
penetrating oil to work, then screw the 
plug back out all the way.

Installation
Please observe the following when installing
the spark plug in the engine:
(cid:2) The contact surfaces between spark plug
and engine must be clean and free of all
contamination.

(cid:2) Bosch spark plugs are coated with anti-
corrosion oil, thus eliminating the need
for any other lubricant. Because the
threads are nickel-plated, they will not
seize in  response to heat.

Wherever possible, spark plugs should be
tightened down with a torque wrench. The
torque applied to the spark plug’s 6-point

fitting is transferred to the seat and the
socket’s threads. Application of excessive
torque or failure to keep the socket attach-
ment correctly aligned within the spark-plug
well can place stress on the shell and loosen
the insulator. This destroys the spark plug’s
thermal-response properties and can lead 
to engine damage. This is one reason why
torque should never be applied beyond the
specified level. The specified tightening
torques apply to new spark plugs, with 
a light coating of oil.

Under actual field conditions, spark plugs
are often installed without a torque wrench.
As a result, too much torque is usually used
to install spark plugs. Bosch recommends
the following procedure:

First: Screw the spark plug into the clean
socket by hand until it is too tight to con-
tinue. Then apply the spark-plug wrench. 
At this point, we distinguish between:
(cid:2) New spark plugs with flat seal seats, 

which are tightened by an angle of ap-
proximately 90° after initial resistance 
to turning

(cid:2) Used spark plugs with flat seal seats,
which are tightened by an angle of
 approximately 30° 

(cid:2) Spark plugs with conical seal seats, 
which are tightened by an angle of 
approximately 15°

Second: Do not allow the socket wrench 
to tilt to an angle relative to the plug while
either tightening or loosening; this would
apply excessive vertical or lateral force to 
the insulator, making the plug unsuitable 
for use.

Third: When socket wrench with a loose
mandrel, ensure that the opening for the
mandrel is above the top of the spark plug 
to allow the mandrel to be drawn through
the socket wrench. If the opening is too low
on the plug, resulting in the mandrel only
engaging a short distance, spark plug dam-
age can result.

Spark plugs

Handling spark plugs

Mistakes and their consequences
Only spark plugs specified by the engine
manufacturer or as recommended by Bosch
should be installed. Drivers should consult
the professionals at a Bosch service center to
avoid the possibility of incorrect spark-plug
selection. Sales assistance and guidance are
available from catalogues, sales displays with
reference charts and application guides
available on the premises.

Use of the wrong spark-plug type can 
lead to serious engine damage. The most
 frequently encountered mistakes are:
(cid:2) Incorrect heat-range code number
(cid:2) Incorrect thread length, or
(cid:2) Modifications to the seal seat

Incorrect heat-range code number
It is essential to ensure that the spark plug’s
heat range corresponds to the engine manu-
facturer’s specifications and/or Bosch re -
commendations. Use of spark plugs with 
a heat-range code number other than that
specified for the specific engine can cause
auto-ignition.

Incorrect thread length
The length of the threads on the spark plug
must correspond precisely to the depth of
the socket in the cylinder head. If the
threads are too long, the spark plug will pro-
trude too far into the combustion chamber.
Possible consequences:
(cid:2) Piston damage
(cid:2) Carbon residue baked onto the spark-plug
threads can make it impossible to remove
the plug, or

(cid:2) Overheated spark plugs

A threaded section that is too short will
 prevent the spark plug from reaching far
enough into the combustion chamber.
 Possible consequences: 
(cid:2) Poor ignition and flame propagation to

the mixture

(cid:2) The spark plug fails to reach its burn-off

(self-cleaning) temperature, and

(cid:2) The lower threads in the cylinder head’s
socket become coated with baked-on
 carbon residue

Modifications to the seal seat
Never install a sealing ring, shim or washer
on a spark plug featuring a conical, or ta-
pered, seal seat. On spark plugs with a flat
seal seat, use only the captive sealing ring
 already installed on the plug. Never remove
this sealing ring, and do not replace it with
another shim or washer of any kind. 

The sealing ring prevents the spark plug
from protruding too far into the combus-
tion chamber. This reduces the efficiency of
thermal transfer from the spark-plug shell 
to the cylinder head, while also preventing
an effective seal at the mating surfaces.

Installation of a supplementary sealing
ring prevents the spark plug from penetrat-
ing far enough into its socket, which also
 reduces thermal transfer between the spark
plug-shell and the cylinder head.

Spark-plug profiles
Spark-plug profiles provide information on
the performance of both engine and plugs.
The appearance of the spark plug’s elec-
trodes and insulator – the spark-plug profile
– provides indications as to how the spark
plug is performing, as well as to the compo-
sition of the induction mixture and the
combustion process within the engine 
(Figs. 1 to 3, following pages).

Assessing the spark-plug profiles is thus
an important part of the engine-diagnosis
procedure. It is essential to observe the fol-
lowing procedure in order to obtain accu-
rate results: The vehicle must be driven be-
fore the spark-plug profiles can be assessed.
If the engine is run for an extended period
at idle, and especially after cold starts, car-
bon residue will form, preventing an accu-
rate assessment of the spark plug’s condi-
tion. The vehicle should first be driven a dis-
tance of 10 kilometers (6 miles) at various
engine speeds and under moderate load.
Avoid extended idling before switching off
the engine.

No residue from leaded fuel additives or engine-oil
 alloying constituents. No overheating.

2 Sooted.
Insulator tip, electrodes and spark-plug shell covered 
with a felt-textured, matt-black coating of soot.
Cause: Incorrect mixture adjustment (carburetor, injec-
tion): mixture too rich, extremely dirty air filter, automatic
choke or choke cable defective, vehicle used only for
 extremely short hauls, spark plug too cold, heat-range
code number too low.
Effects: Ignition miss, poor cold starts.
Corrective action: Adjust mixture and starting device,
check air filter.

3 Oil-fouled.
Insulator tip, electrodes and spark-plug shell covered

Effects: Ignition miss, poor starting.
Corrective action: Overhaul engine, use correct 
oil/fuel mixture, replace spark plugs.

4 Lead fouling.
A brownish-yellow glaze, possibly with a greenish tint,
forms on the insulator tip.
Cause: Fuel additives containing lead. The glaze forms
when the engine is operated under high loads after
 extended part-load operation.

cally conductive, leading to ignition miss.
Corrective action: New spark plugs, cleaning is point-
less.

well as engine damage. 
Corrective action: Restore engine to satisfactory
 operating condition. Replace spark plugs, change oil 
as indicated.

Electronic Control

Open- and closed-loop electronic control

Electronic Control

“Motronic” is the name of an engine-man-
agement system that facilitates open- and
closed-loop control of gasoline engines
within a single ECU. The first Motronic sys-
tem went into volume production at Bosch
in 1979. Essentially, it comprised the func-
tions of electronic fuel injection and elec-
tronic ignition. With the advances made 
in the field of microelectronics, it has been
possible to continuously expand the capa-
bilities of Motronic systems over the course
of time. The range of functions has been
continuously adapted in response to pre-
vailing demands and the complexity of suc-
cessive Motronic systems has consequently
increased. 

Although cost considerations limited appli-
cation of early Motronic versions to luxury-
class cars, progressively more stringent
 demands for clean emissions is gradually
 leading to widespread use of this system.
Since the mid-1990s, all new engine pro-
jects in which Bosch has been involved 
use Motronic systems.

Open- and closed-loop
 electronic control

Motronic comprises all the components
which control the gasoline engine (Fig. 1).
The torque requested by the driver is ad-
justed by means of actuators or converters.
The main individual components are
(cid:2) The electrically actuated throttle valve (air
system): This controls the air-mass flow to
the cylinders and thus the cylinder charge.

(cid:2) The fuel injectors (fuel system): These

meter the correct amount of fuel for the
cylinder charge.

(cid:2) The ignition coils and spark plugs (igni-
tion system): These provide for correctly
timed ignition of the air/fuel mixture in
the cylinder.

Modern-day engines are subject to exacting
demands with regard to
(cid:2) Exhaust-emission behavior
(cid:2) Power output
(cid:2) Fuel consumption
(cid:2) Diagnostic capability, and
(cid:2) Comfort/user-friendliness

Where necessary, additional components 
are installed on the engine for this purpose.
All the manipulated variables are calculated
in accordance with prespecified algorithms
in the Motronic ECU. The actuating signals
for the actuators are generated from these
variables.

Acquisition of operating data
Sensor and setpoint generators
Motronic uses sensors and setpoint genera-
tors to collect the operating data required
for open- and closed-loop control of the
 engine (Fig. 1). 

Setpoint generators (e.g., switches) record

settings made by the driver, such as
(cid:2) The position of the ignition key in the

 ignition lock (terminal 15)

(cid:2) The positions of A/C-control switches 
(cid:2) The cruise-control lever setting

Sensors detect physical and chemical vari-
ables, thus providing information about 
the engine’s current operating state.
 Examples of such sensors are:
(cid:2) Engine-speed sensor for detecting the
crankshaft position and calculating the
engine speed

(cid:2) Phase sensor for detecting the phase angle
(engine operating cycle) or the camshaft
position

(cid:2) Engine-temperature sensor and intake-air
temperature sensor for calculating tem-
perature-dependent correction variables
(cid:2) Knock sensor for detecting engine knock
(cid:2) Air-mass meter, and/or
(cid:2) Intake-manifold pressure sensor for

charge recording

(cid:2) Lambda oxygen sensor for lambda closed-

loop control

Electronic Control

Open- and closed-loop electronic control

Signal processing in the ECU
The signals produced by the sensors can 
take the form of digital, pulse-type or analog
voltage signals. Input circuits in the ECU, 
or in the sensors – which will increasingly be
the case in the future – process these signals.
These circuits transform voltages to the
 levels required for subsequent processing 
in the ECU’s microprocessor. 

Digital input signals are read in directly in
the microcontroller and stored as digital in-
formation. Analog signals are converted into
digital signals by an analog/digital converter.

Processing of operating data
From the input signals, the engine ECU
 detects the engine’s current operating state
of the engine and uses this information in
conjunction with requests from auxiliary
systems and from the driver (pedal-travel
sensor and operating switches) to calculate
the command signals for the actuators. 

The tasks performed by the engine ECU

are subdivided into functions. The algo-
rithms are stored as software in the ECU’s
program memory.

ECU functions
Motronic has two basic functions: Firstly,
metering the correct mass of fuel in accor-
dance with the air mass drawn into the en-
gine, and secondly, triggering the ignition
spark at the best possible moment in time.
In this way, fuel injection and ignition can
be optimally matched. 

The performance of the microcontrollers

used in Motronic permits a wealth of fur-
ther open- and closed-loop control func-
tions to be integrated. Progressive tightening
of emissions limits simultaneously spurs the
demand for functions capable of improving
the engine’s exhaust behavior and exhaust-
gas treatment. Functions that are capable 
of making a contribution here include:
(cid:2) Idle-speed control
(cid:2) Lambda closed-loop control
(cid:2) Control of the evaporative-emissions

 control system (canister purge)

(cid:2) Knock control
(cid:2) Exhaust-gas recirculation for reducing

NOX emissions, and

(cid:2) Control of the secondary-air system to

ensure that the catalytic converter quickly
reaches full operational readiness

Where there are increased demands on the
drivetrain, the system can also be extended
by the following additional functions:
(cid:2) Control of the exhaust-gas turbocharger,

and 

(cid:2) Variable-tract intake manifold in order to

increase engine power and torque

(cid:2) Camshaft control in order to reduce ex-
haust-gas emissions and fuel consump-
tion, and to increase engine power

(cid:2) Torque- and speed-limiting functions to

protect engine and vehicle

(cid:2) Control of gasoline direct injection in or-
der to reduce exhaust-gas emissions and
fuel consumption, and to increase engine
power

Ever-increasing priority is being given in the
design and development of motor vehicles
to the driver’s comfort and convenience.
This also affects engine management. Exam-
ples of typical comfort and convenience
functions are:
(cid:2) Cruise control (vehicle-speed controller),

and

(cid:2) Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
(cid:2) Torque adaptation during gearshifts on

automatic transmissions, and

(cid:2) Load-reversal damping (reducing abrupt-

ness of driver control commands)

Actuator triggering
The ECU functions are executed in accor-
dance with the algorithms stored the pro-
gram memory of the Motronic ECU. This
produces variables (e.g., fuel mass to be in-
jected), which are set by means of actuators
(e.g., defined-time actuation of fuel injec-
tors). The ECU generates the electrical
 actuating signals for the actuators. 

Electronic Control

Open- and closed-loop electronic control

215

The crankshaft-synchronized channel uses
the cylinder charge currently available to
calculate the maximum possible torque for
this operating point. If the desired torque 
is less than the maximum possible torque, 
a rapid reduction in torque (e.g., differential
component of idle-speed control differential
component, torque reduction during gear
shifting, surge damping) can be achieved 
by retarding the ignition or blanking out
one or more cylinders altogether (injection
blank-out, e.g., TCS intervention or when
the engine is overrunning). 

On earlier M-Motronic systems without 
a torque structure, a reduction in torque
(e.g., at the request of the automatic trans-
mission when changing gear) is performed
directly by the function concerned, for 
example, by retarding the ignition angle. 
There is no coordination between individual
requests or of command implementation.

Torque structure
The torque-based system structure was first
introduced with ME7-Motronic. All perfor-
mance requirements (Fig. 2) placed on the
engine are consistently converted into a
torque demand. The torque coordinator pri-
oritizes the torque demands from internal
and external loads/consumers and other
 requirements relating to engine efficiency.
The resulting desired torque is allocated to
the components of the air, fuel and ignition
systems. 

The charge component (air system) is
 implemented by varying the throttle-valve
aperture and – in the case of turbocharged
engines – by actuating the wastegate valve.
The fuel component is essentially deter-
mined by means of the injected fuel, taking
account of canister purge (evaporative-
emissions control system). 

The torque is adjusted via two channels.

The air channel (main channel) involves
 calculating the required cylinder charge
from the torque to be converted. From the
required cylinder charge, the required throt-
tle-valve aperture is calculated. The required
injected-fuel mass is directly related to the
cylinder charge due to the fixed lambda
value specified. The air channel only permits
gradual changes in torque (e.g. integral
component of idle-speed control).

Open- and closed-loop electronic control

Monitoring concept
It is imperative that, when the vehicle is in
motion, it is never able to accelerate when
the driver does not want it to. Consequently,
the monitoring concept for the electronic
engine-power control system must meet ex-
acting requirements. To this end, the ECU
includes a monitoring processor in addition
to the main processor, and the two proces-
sors monitor one another.

Electronic diagnosis
The diagnosis functions integrated in the
ECU monitor the Motronic system (ECU,
sensors and actuators) for malfunctions and
faults, store details of any faults detected in
the data memory, and initiate substitute
functions where necessary. A diagnosis lamp
or a display within the instrument cluster
alerts the driver to the faults. 

System testers (e.g., KTS650) are con-
nected via a diagnosis interface in the service
garage/workshop. These allow the fault in-
formation stored in the ECU to be read out. 

The diagnosis function was originally in-
tended only to assist mechanics in conduct-
ing vehicle inspections and services in ser-
vice garages/workshops. However, with the
introduction of the Californian OBD (On-
Board Diagnosis) emission-control legisla-
tion, diagnosis functions were now stipu-
lated which check the entire engine system
for exhaust-related faults and indicate these
faults by way of a fault indicator lamp. Ex-
amples of such functions are catalytic-con-
verter diagnosis, lambda-sensor diagnosis,
and misfire detection. These requirements
were later adopted in modified form in
 European legislation (EOBD).

Vehicle management
Motronic can communicate with the ECUs
of other vehicle systems via bus systems,
such as CAN (Controller Area Network).
Figure 3 shows some examples. The ECUs
can process the data from other systems in
their control algorithms as input signals
(e.g., Motronic reduces engine torque in re-
sponse to a gearshift operation by the trans-
mission to ensure a smoother gear change).

Motronic systems in motorsport

Simultaneously with the introduction of the
Motronic systems on production vehicles,
modified versions were also used on racing
engines. Whereas the development objectives
for production versions are aspects such as
convenience, safety, reliability, emission limits
and fuel consumption, the main focus in mo-
tor-racing applications is on maximum perfor-
mance over a short period. The production
costs with regard to choice of materials and
dimensioning of components are a secondary
consideration.

But the production and racing versions of
the Motronic system are still based on identi-
cal principles because in both cases similar
functions achieve contrasting aims. The ex-
cess-air factor and knock control systems 
are examples of this.

Environmental protection regulations are in-
creasingly a consideration even in motorsport.
The cars in the German Touring Car Champi-
onship, for example, are now fitted with cat-
alytic converters. Noise and fuel-consumption
levels have to be limited in more and more
classes of racing. Consumption-reducing de-
velopments used on production cars quickly
transfer to motor racing where shorter or less

frequent refueling stops can make the differ-
ence between winning and losing. The 2001
Le Mans 24-hour race, for example, was won
for the first time by a car with a Bosch gaso-
line direct-injection system.

The high revving speed of racing engines mini-
mizes the time available during each operating
cycle. The vast amount of process data re-
quires high processor clock frequencies and
the use of multiprocessor systems to a greater
extent.

Not only the ECU but also the ignition and
fuel-injection components have to operate at
extremely high speeds. This requires ignition
coils with fast charging times and fuel-system
components that are capable of quicker
throughput and higher pressures. Spark plugs
with smaller thread diameters made of materi-
als adapted to the operating temperatures en-
countered allow higher compression ratios.

During the race, data can be transmitted 
by radio from the car to the pits. Known as
telemetry, this technology allows constant
monitoring of operating parameters such 
as pressures and temperatures.

power (e.g., exhaust-gas turbocharging), 
fuel consumption, and the stipulations of
the relevant emission-control legislation.
Californian emission-control and diagnosis
legislation (Californian Air Resources Board,
CARB) places particularly stringent require-
ments on the Motronic diagnosis system.
Some emissions-related systems can only be
diagnosed with the aid of additional compo-
nents (e.g., evaporative-emissions control
system).

In the course of the development history

of Motronic systems, successive Motronic
generations (e.g., M1, M3, ME7) have dif-
fered mainly in the design of the hardware.
The basic distinguishing features are the mi-
crocontroller family, the peripheral modules
and the output-stage modules (chipset). 
The hardware variations arising from the re-
quirements of different vehicle manufactur-
ers are distinguished by manufacturer-spe-
cific identification numbers (e.g., ME7.0).

In addition to the versions described in the
following, there are also Motronic systems
with integrated transmission management
(e.g., MG and MEG-Motronic). However,
these are not in extensive use, as the de-
mands on hardware are considerable.

M-Motronic
M-Motronic is an engine-management sys-
tem for manifold-injection gasoline engines.
It is characterized by the fact that the air is
supplied through a mechanically adjustable
throttle valve. 

The accelerator pedal is connected to the
throttle valve by way of a linkage or a Bow-
den cable. The position of the accelerator
pedal determines how far the throttle valve
opens. This controls the air mass flowing
through the intake manifold to the cylin-
ders. 

An idle actuator allows a defined air-mass
flow to bypass the throttle valve. This pro-
vides a means with the additional air of
holding the engine speed at a constant level,
for example,  when idling (idle-speed con-
trol). To do so, the engine ECU controls the
opening cross-section of the bypass channel.
M-Motronic is no longer of significance
to new developments in the European and
North American markets, since it has been
superseded by ME-Motronic.

ME-Motronic
ME-Motronic is characterized by electronic
engine-power control. In this system, there
is no longer a mechanical connection be-
tween the accelerator pedal and the throttle
valve. The position of the accelerator pedal,
i.e., the driver command, is detected by a
potentiometer attached to the accelerator
pedal (pedal-travel sensor in the accelerator-
pedal module, Fig. 4 Pos. 23) and read in by
the engine ECU (12) in the form of an ana-
log voltage signal. In response, the ECU gen-
erates output signals that set the opening
cross-section of the electrically actuated
throttle valve (3) so that the engine produces
the desired torque.

A system that regulates engine power in this
way was first introduced by Bosch in 1986.
In addition to the engine ECU, the original
system also had a separate ECU for engine-
power control. 

The increasingly higher integration den-
sity of electronic systems allowed the combi-
nation of Motronic functions and engine-
power control in a single ECU (1994).
 Nevertheless, functions remained divided
between two microcontrollers. The next step
was taken in 1998 with the launch of the
new Motronic generation, the ME7, which
executes all engine-management functions
in a single microcontroller. This advance 
was made possible by the ever-increasing
processing capacity of microcontrollers.

DI-Motronic
The introduction of direct injection in the
gasoline engine necessitated a control con-
cept which facilitates both homogeneous
and stratified-charge operation. 

In homogeneous mode, the fuel injector 

is actuated in such a way as to produce
 homogeneous mixture distribution in the
combustion chamber. The fuel is injected
during the induction stroke for this purpose.
In stratified-charge mode, the process of
 retarding injection until the compression
stroke, shortly before ignition, creates a
 locally limited mixture cloud in the area 
of the spark plug.

In addition to the systems which facilitate

both stratified-charge and homogeneous
operation, there are also purely homoge-
neous systems, in which the engine is oper-
ated homogeneously and stoichiometrically
(λ = 1) over the entire operating range.
These latter systems are increasingly being
used in conjunction with supercharging.

The system diagram (Fig. 6) shows an exam-
ple of a DI-Motronic system. The first se-
ries-production DI-Motronic was launched
in the Volkswagen Lupo in 2000.

Operating-mode selection

Operating-mode coordination and
changeover
Further operating modes in addition to
 homogeneous and stratified-charge modes
are also possible. Injection of a basic quan-
tity of fuel during the induction stroke to-
gether with subsequent injection during 
the compression stroke result in a stratified
charge at the spark plug, surrounded by a
homogeneous lean mixture spread through
the whole combustion chamber (homoge-
nous-lean). Further operating modes, for
 instance for heating the catalytic converter,
are set by means of highly retarded injection
points and moments of ignition.

DI-Motronic incorporates an operating-
mode coordinator, which enables change -
over to a different operating mode when
 engine requirements demand. The  basis for
selecting an operating mode is the operat-
ing-mode map, which plots operating mode
against engine speed and torque.  Deviating
operating-mode requirements are evaluated
in the priority list (Fig. 5). This produces the
required operating mode. But before igni-
tion and fuel injection can be changed over
to the new operating mode, control func-
tions for exhaust-gas recirculation, tank ven-
tilation (canister purge), charge-flow control

valve and throttle-valve setting are initiated
if required. The system then waits for
 acknowledgement.

In stratified-charge mode at λ > 1, the
throttle valve is fully open and the inducted
air can enter the engine virtually unthrot-
tled. The torque is proportional to the
 injected fuel mass.

During changeover to homogeneous
mode, the air mass, which now determines
the torque to a large extent, must be reduced
very quickly and a desired lambda value set
– for a stoichiometric mixture of λ = 1 
(Fig. 7). The torque output by the engine
now varies in relation to the accelerator-
pedal position, although the driver is un-
aware of any change.

Brake-booster vacuum control
When the engine is operating with an unre-
stricted intake air flow, there is insufficient
vacuum in the intake manifold to provide
the vacuum required by the brake booster. 
A vacuum switch or pressure sensor is used
to detect whether there is sufficient vacuum
in the brake booster. If necessary, the engine
has to be switched to a different operating
mode in order to provide the required vac-
uum for the brake booster.

Bifuel-Motronic (natural gas/gasoline)
Bifuel-Motronic has been developed from
ME-Motronic and therefore contains all the
components for manifold injection familiar
from ME-Motronic. Bifuel-Motronic also
contains the components for the natural-gas
system (Fig. 8). 

Whereas in retrofit systems natural-gas
operation is controlled by means of an ex-
ternal unit, with Bifuel-Motronic the CNG
functionality is integrated in the engine-
management system. The desired engine
torque and the variables characterizing the
operating state are generated only once in
the Bifuel ECU. The physically based struc-
ture of the engine-management system
makes it possible to easily integrate the
 parameters specific for gas operation. 

Changeover
Depending on the engine design, it can be
useful in the case of high load demands to
switch automatically to the fuel type which
provides the maximum engine power. Further
automatic changeovers may also be useful in
order, for example, to implement an opti-
mized exhaust-gas strategy and to heat up the
catalytic converter more quickly, or basically
to effect fuel management. However, it is im-
portant in the case of automatic changeovers
that these be implemented on a torque-neu-
tral basis, i.e., they are not noticeable to the
driver.

The 1-ECU concept enables fuel change -
over to be performed in different ways. One
option is direct changeover, comparable with
a switch. Here, injected must not be inter-
rupted, as this would increase the risk of mis-
firing during operation. However, the sudden
injection of gas in comparison with gasoline
operation results in a greater volume displace-
ment to such an extent that the intake-mani-
fold pressure increases and the cylinder
charge decreases as a result of changeover by
roughly 5 %. This displacement effect must 
be compensated for by a larger throttle-valve
angle. In order to keep the engine torque con-
stant during changeover under load condi-
tions, it is necessary to effect an additional

 intervention in the ignition angles, which
 facilitates a fast change of torque. 

Another option for changeover is fading
from gasoline to gas operation. In order to
switch to gas operation, gasoline injection 
is reduced by a dividing factor and gas in -
jection increased accordingly. In this way,
jumps in the air charge are avoided. There is
also the option of correcting an altered gas
quality with lambda closed-loop control
during changeover. With this method, it is
possible to effect the changeover even at
high load without a noticeable change of
torque.

Retrofit systems often do not offer the op-
tion of switching between the gasoline and
natural-gas operating modes under coordi-
nated conditions. For this reason, many sys-
tems effect the changeover only during the
overrun phases in order to avoid torque
jumps.

European On-Board Diagnosis
Current EOBD legislation stipulates separate
detection, handling and transmission of
faults during operation with gasoline or
CNG. This calls for the fault memory to be
doubled in size. An alternative suggestion
provides for a scenario where faults which
are identified independently of the fuel (e.g.,
speed sensor faulty) are handled indepen-
dently of the fuel. New fault paths are added
for gas-specific faults so that these can also
be stored and read out in the fault memory.

System structure

A few years ago, it was still possible to repre-
sent the functionality of Motronic systems
with “simple” system and function descrip-
tions. Now the open- and closed-loop con-
trol operations for gasoline engines have be-
come so complex that a structured system
description is necessary. 

All torque demands placed on the engine

are handled by Motronic as torque values
and centrally coordinated. The requested
torque is calculated and set by means of 
(cid:2) The electrically actuated throttle valve 

(air system)

(cid:2) The ignition angle (ignition system)
(cid:2) The fuel quantity in the case of gasoline

direct injection (fuel system)

(cid:2) The use of injection blank-outs, and
(cid:2) Controlling the wastegate on exhaust-

gas-turbocharged engines

Figure 9 shows the system structure used for
new Motronic systems and their various
subsystems. 

In Figure 9, Motronic is referred to as the
system. The different areas within the system
are referred to as subsystems. Some subsys-
tems are purely software constructs in the
ECU (e.g., Torque Structure), while others
also incorporate hardware components (e.g.,
Fuel System and Fuel Injectors). The various
subsystems are interconnected by defined
interfaces.

The system structure describes the Motronic
engine-management system from the func-
tional-sequence point of view. The system
comprises the ECU (with hardware and soft-
ware) and external components (actuators,
sensors and mechanical components), which
can be electrically connected to the ECU.

The system structure divides this mecha-

tronic system hierarchically according to
functional criteria into 14 subsystems (e.g.,
Air System, Fuel System), which in turn are
subdivided into a total of 52 main functions
(e.g., Boost-pressure Control, Closed-loop
Lambda Control) (Fig. 9).

Since the introduction of Electronic Throttle
Control (ETC) in the ME7, the torque de-
mands on the engine have been centrally
 coordinated in the Torque Demand and
Torque Structure subsystems. The control of
cylinder charge by the electrically controlled
throttle valve allows adjustment of the
torque demand made by the driver via the
accelerator pedal (driver command). At the
same time, all other torque demands that
arise from vehicle operation (e.g., when the
A/C compressor is switched on) can be
 coordinated within the torque structure.

Subsystems and main functions

Subsystems and 
main  functions

The description which follows provides a very
general summary of the essential features 
of the main functions implemented in a
Motronic system. A more detailed presenta-
tion is not possible within the scope of this
publication.

System Documentation (SD)
System Documentation consists of technical
documents which describe the customer
project (e.g. description of ECUs, engine
and vehicle data, and configuration descrip-
tions). 

System Control (SC)
The functions controlling the computer are
combined in System Control. 

The System Control, SYC main function

defines the microcontroller states: 
(cid:2) Initialization (system run-up)
(cid:2) Running state (normal operation) – this is
the status in which the main functions are
executed

(cid:2) ECU run-on (e.g., for fan run-on, hard-

ware test)

Coordination Engine (CE)
Both the engine status and the engine oper-
ating data are coordinated in Coordination
Engine. This is done at a central point, be-
cause many further functionalities are af-
fected in the overall engine-management,
depending on this coordination.

The Coordination Engine States, CES main
function contains both the various engine
states, such as starting, running operation
and switched-off engine, and coordination
functions for injection activation (overrun
fuel cutoff/restart) and for start/stop sys-
tems.

The operating modes for gasoline direct

injection (DI-Motronic) are coordinated
and changed over in the Coordination Engine
Operation, CEM main function. In order to
determine the required operating mode, 

the requirements for various functionalities
are coordinated on the basis of defined pri-
orities in the operating-mode coordinator. 

Torque Demand (TD)
All the torque demands on the engine are
consistently coordinated on the torque level
in the system structure of ME-Motronic and
DI-Motronic. The Torque Demand (TD)
subsystem detects all torque demands and
makes them available to the Torque Structure
(TS) subsystem as input variables.

The Torque Demand Signal Conditioning,
TDS main function essentially consists of
detecting the accelerator-pedal position. 
The pedal position is detected by two inde-
pendent angle-position sensors and con-
verted into a standardized accelerator-pedal
angle. A number of plausibility checks are
carried out to ensure that, in the event of 
a single fault, the standardized accelerator-
pedal angle cannot adopt a greater value
than the  actual accelerator-pedal position.
The Torque Demand Driver, TDD main
function calculates a setpoint value for the
engine torque from the accelerator-pedal
position. In addition, it defines the accelera-
tor-pedal characteristic. 

Torque Demand Cruise Control, TDC
 (vehicle-speed controller) holds the vehicle
at a constant speed as long as the accelerator
pedal is not depressed, assuming this is
 possible with the available engine torque.
The most important shutdown conditions
for this function include operating the “Off ”
button on the driver’s control lever, operat-
ing the brakes or disengaging the clutch, and
failure to reach the required minimum road
speed.

Torque Demand Idle Speed Control, TDI
 regulates the speed of the engine at idle
when the accelerator pedal is not depressed.
The setpoint value for idle speed is defined
to obtain even and smooth engine running 
at all times. Accordingly, the setpoint idle
speed is set higher than the nominal idle
speed under certain operating conditions

nels, depending on the
current operating
mode.

Torque Conversion,
TCV calculates from
the desired-torque in-
put variables the set-
point values for the
relative air mass, the
air/fuel ratio λ, the
 ignition angle, and
 injection blank-out
(e.g., for overrun fuel
cutoff). The setpoint
air-mass value is cal-
culated so that the
 setpoint for the air
mass/torque is ob-
tained at precisely 
the moment when 
the specified oxygen
content and the speci-
fied ignition timing
are applied.

Torque Modeling,
TMO calculates a the-
oretically optimum indicated engine torque
from the current values for cylinder charge,
oxygen content (lambda), ignition timing,
reduction stage, and engine speed. An indi-
cated actual torque is determined with the
aid of an efficiency chain. The efficiency
chain consists of three different efficiency
levels: the blank-out efficiency (proportional
to the number of firing cylinders), the igni-
tion-timing efficiency (resulting from the
shift in the actual ignition angle relative to
the optimum ignition angle), and the oxy-
gen-content efficiency (obtained from plot-
ting the efficiency characteristic against the
air/fuel ratio).

(e.g., when the engine is cold). A higher idle
speed may also be used to assist catalytic-
converter heating, to increase the output of
the A/C compressor, or if the battery charge
level is low.

The Torque Demand Auxiliary Functions,

TDA main function generates internal
torque limitations and demands (e.g., 
engine-speed limitation, damping engine-
bucking oscillations).

Torque Structure (TS)
The Torque Structure subsystem is where 
all torque demands are coordinated. The 
required torque is then set by the air, fuel
and ignition systems.

Torque Coordination, TCD coordinates all
torque demands. The various demands (e.g.,
from the driver, engine-speed limitation) 
are prioritized and converted into setpoint
torque values for the various control chan-

functions are also part of the air system.

determines the cylinder charge composed 
of fresh air and inert gas with the aid of the
available load sensors. The air-mass flows
are used to model the pressure conditions 
in the intake manifold (intake-manifold
pressure model). 

Air System Intake Manifold Control, AIC
calculates the setpoint positions for the in-
take-manifold and charge-flow control
valves. 

The vacuum in the intake manifold allows
exhaust-gas recirculation, which is calcu-
lated and adjusted in Air System Exhaust Gas
Recirculation, AEC. 

Air System Valve Control, AVC calculates
the setpoint values for intake- and exhaust-
valve positions and controls these settings.
This influences the quantity of residual ex-
haust gas that is recirculated internally. 

Air System Boost Control, ABC is responsi-

ble for calculating the charge-air pressure 
in exhaust-gas-turbocharged engines and
controls the actuators for this system.

Engines with gasoline direct injection 
are run in stratified-charge mode with the
throttle fully open at low loads. Conse-
quently, the pressure in the intake manifold
under such conditions is virtually atmos-
pheric pressure. Air System Brake Booster,
ABB ensures that there is sufficient vacuum
in the brake booster by requesting a required
amount of flow restriction.

Fuel Supply System, FSS has the function of
delivering fuel from the fuel tank to the fuel
rail at the required pressure and in the re-
quired quantity. In demand-controlled sys-
tems, the pressure can be regulated between
200 and 600 kPa. A pressure sensor provides
feedback of the actual value. 

In the case of gasoline direct injection, 
the fuel-supply system also includes a high-
pressure circuit consisting of an HDP1-type
high-pressure pump and a pressure-control
valve (DSV), HDP2- and HDP5-type de-
mand-controlled high-pressure pumps with
fuel-supply control valve (MSV). This allows
pressure in the high-pressure circuit to be
varied between 3 and 11 MPa, depending 
on the engine operating point. The setpoint
value is calculated depending on engine
 operating point and the actual pressure is
 detected by a high-pressure sensor.

Fuel System Purge Control, FPC controls
regeneration during engine operation of the
fuel that evaporates from the fuel tank and
that is collected in the carbon canister of 
the evaporative-emissions control system.
On the basis of the specified on/off ratio for
operating the canister-purge valve and the
pressure conditions, an actual value for the
total mass flow through the valve is calcu-
lated. This is taken into account by the Air
System Throttle Control (ATC) function. 
An actual fuel-content value is also calcu-
lated and is subtracted from the setpoint
fuel mass.

Fuel System Evaporation Leakage Detec-
tion, FEL checks the gas-tightness of the fuel
tank in accordance with the requirements of
the Californian OBD II legislation. The de-
sign and method of operation of this diag-
nostic system are described in the chapter
headed “Diagnosis/OBD functions”. 

Fuel System (FS)
The Fuel System (FS) subsystem calculates
the output variables for the fuel-injection
system relative to crankshaft position, i.e.,
the point(s) at which fuel is injected and the
quantity of fuel injected. 

Fuel System Feed Forward Control, FFC cal-
culates the fuel mass from the setpoint cylin-
der charge, the setpoint oxygen content and
additional corrections (e.g., transient com-
pensation) or multiplicative corrections
(e.g., corrections for engine start, warm-up
and restart). Other corrections arise from
the closed-loop lambda control, canister
purge and mixture adaptation. In DI sys-
tems, specific values are calculated for the
operating modes (e.g., fuel injection during
the induction stroke or during the compres-
sion stroke, multiple injection). 

Fuel System Injection Timing, FIT calcu-

lates the injection duration and the fuel-
 injection position. It ensures that the fuel
 injectors are open at the correct time relative
to crankshaft rotation. The injection dura-
tion is calculated on the basis of previously
calculated fuel mass and status variables
(e.g., intake-manifold pressure, battery volt-
age, fuel-rail pressure, combustion-chamber
pressure). 

Fuel System Mixture Adaptation, FMA
improves the pilot-control accuracy of the
oxygen content by adjusting the longer-term
lambda-controller errors relative to the neu-
tral value. For smaller cylinder charges, the
lambda-controller error is used to calculate
an additive correction value. On systems
with a hot-film air-mass meter, this nor-
mally reflects small amounts of intake-
manifold leakage. On systems with an in-
take-manifold pressure sensor, the lambda
controller corrects the pressure-sensor 
residual exhaust gas or offset error. For
larger cylinder charges, a multiplicative cor-
rection factor is calculated. This essentially
represents the hot-film air-mass meter gain
error,  fuel-rail pressure regulator inaccura-
cies (on DI systems) and fuel-injector char-
acteristic-gradient errors.

Ignition Control, IGC calcu-
lates the current setpoint ig-
nition angle from the engine
operating conditions, taking
account of intervention by
the torque structure. It then
generates an ignition spark
across the spark-plug elec-
trodes at the required time.
The resulting ignition angle 
is calculated from the basic
ignition angle and the operat-
ing-point-dependent igni-
tion-angle corrections and
demands. When determining
the engine-speed and load-
dependent basic ignition an-
gle, the effects of camshaft control, charge-
flow control valve, cylinder-bank distribu-
tion, and special direct-injection operating
modes are taken into account where applica-
ble. In order to calculate the most advanced
possible ignition angle, the basic ignition
angle is corrected by the advance angles for
engine warm-up, knock control and – where
 applicable – exhaust-gas recirculation. 
The point at which the ignition driver stage
needs to be triggered is calculated from 
the current ignition angle and the required
charge time for the ignition coil. The driver
stage is activated accordingly.

reference level that is obtained for individual
cylinders via a low-pass filter from previous
combustion strokes. The reference level
therefore represents the background engine
noise when the engine is running free of en-

gine knock. The comparison analyzes how
much louder current combustion is than the
background level. Above a certain threshold,
engine knock is assumed to occur. Both cal-
culation of the reference level and detection
of engine knock can take account of changes
in operating conditions (engine speed,
 engine-speed dynamics, engine-load
 dynamics).

The knock-control function generates an
ignition-timing adjustment for each individ-
ual cylinder. This is taken into account when
calculating the current ignition angle (igni-
tion retard). When engine knock is detected,
this ignition-timing adjustment is increased
by an applicable amount. The ignition-tim-
ing retard is then reduced in small incre-
ments if, over an applicable time period,
 engine knock does not occur. 

If a hardware fault is detected, a safety
function is activated (safety ignition-timing
retard).

Exhaust System (ES)
The Exhaust System subsystem intervenes in
the mixture-formation system, adjusts the
excess-air factor, and controls the capacity
utilization of the catalytic converters.

The prime functions of Exhaust System
 Description and Modeling, EDM are to
model physical variables in the exhaust-gas
system, analyze signals and diagnose the
 exhaust-gas temperature sensors (where
 present), and supply key exhaust-gas system
data for tester output. The physical variables
that are modeled are temperature (e.g., for
component-protection purposes), pressure
(primarily for residual-gas detection) and
mass flow (for closed-loop lambda control
and catalytic-converter diagnosis). In addi-
tion, the exhaust-gas excess-air factor is
 calculated (for NOX accumulator-type cat-
alytic-converter control and diagnosis).

The purpose of Exhaust System Air Fuel
Control, EAF using the lambda sensor up-
stream of the front catalytic converter is to
regulate the excess-air factor to a specified
level. This minimizes harmful emissions,
prevents engine-torque fluctuations and
keeps the exhaust-gas composition on the
right side of the lean-mixture limit. The in-
put signals from the closed-loop lambda
control system downstream of the main
 catalytic converter allows further mini -
mization of emissions.

The Exhaust System Three-Way Front Cat-

alyst, ETF main function uses the lambda
sensor downstream of the front catalytic
converter (if fitted). Its signal is a measure 
of the oxygen content in the exhaust gas 
and serves as the basis for reference-value
regulation and catalytic-converter diagnosis.
Reference-value regulation can substantially
improve mixture control and permit opti-
mum conversion response by the catalytic
converter. 

The Exhaust System Three-Way Main Cat-
alyst, ETM main function basically operates
in the same way as the ETF function de-
scribed above. Reference-value regulation,
however, may take different forms depend-

ing on the system. A NOX accumulator-type
catalytic converter operated at λ = 1 displays
optimum conversion response with a spe-
cific oxygen-accumulator content. The refer-
ence-value regulation function sets the ca-
pacity usage to this level. Deviations are
 corrected by compensation components.
The function of Exhaust System NOX
Main Catalyst, ENM is to ensure that NOX
emission requirements in particular are
complied with when the engine is running
on a lean mixture by means of adapted con-
trol of the mixture to the requirements of
the NOX accumulator-type catalytic con-
verter.

Depending on the condition of the cat-
alytic converter, the NOX storage phase is
terminated and the engine switched over 
to an operating mode (λ < 1) in which the
NOX accumulator is emptied and the stored
NOX emissions converted to N2. Regenera-
tion of the NOX accumulator-type catalytic
converter is terminated in response to the
change of signal from the sensor down-
stream of the NOX accumulator-type cat-
alytic converter. In systems with a NOX ac-
cumulator-type catalytic converter, change -
over to a special mode allows desulfurization
of the catalytic converter. 

Exhaust System Control of Temperature,

ECT controls the temperature of the ex-
haust-gas system. Its aim is to speed up the
time it takes the catalytic converters to reach
operating temperature after the engine is
started (catalytic-converter heating), prevent
the catalytic converters from cooling down
during operation (catalytic-converter tem-
perature retention), heat up the NOX accu-
mulator-type catalytic converter for desulfu-
rization, and prevent thermal damage to ex-
haust-gas system components (component
protection). A torque reserve for the TS
(Torque Structure) subsystem is determined
from the heat flow required for a tempera-
ture increase. The temperature increase is
then achieved by retarding the ignition, 
for example. When the engine is idling, 
the heat flow can also be increased by raising
the idle speed.

Electronic Control

Subsystems and main functions

Operating Data (OD)
The Operating Data subsystem records 
all important engine operating parameters,
checks their plausibility and provides sub -
stitute data where required.

Operating Data Engine Position Manage-
ment, OEP calculates the position of the
crankshaft and the camshaft using the pro -
cessed input signals from the crankshaft and
camshaft sensors. It calculates the engine
speed from this information. The crank  shaft
timing wheel (two missing teeth) and the
characteristics of the camshaft signal are
used to synchronize the engine and the 
ECU and to monitor synchonization while
the engine is running. 

The camshaft signal pattern and the en-
gine shutoff position are analyzed in order
to optimize the start time. This allows rapid
synchronization.

Operating Data Temperature Measure-
ment, OTM processes the temperature read-
ings provided by the temperature sensors,
performs plausibility checks on them, and
provides substitute data in the event of
faults. The ambient temperature and the
 engine-oil temperature may also be detected
in addition to the temperature of the engine
and the intake air. The input voltage signals
are assigned to a temperature reading. This
is followed by calculation of a characteristic
curve.

Operating Data Battery Voltage, OBV
function is responsible for providing the
supply-voltage signals and performing diag-
nostic operations on them. The raw signal 
is detected at terminal 15 and, if necessary,
the main relay. 

Misfire Detection Irregular Running, OMI
monitors the engine for ignition and com-
bustion misses (see the chapter entitled 
“Diagnosis/OBD functions”).

Operating Data Vehicle Speed, OVS is re-
sponsible for detecting, conditioning and
 diagnosing the vehicle speed signal. This
variable is needed, among others, for cruise
control, for speed limiting (υmax) and in the
case of the hand switch for gear recognition.

Depending on the configuration, there is 
the option of using the variables supplied
via the CAN by the instrument cluster or 
the ABS/ESP ECU.

Communication (CO)
The Communication subsystem encompasses
all Motronic main functions that communi-
cate with other systems.

Communication User Interface, COU pro-
vides the connection to diagnostic (e.g., en-
gine analyzer) and calibration equipment.
Communication takes place via the K-line,
though the CAN interface can also be used
for this purpose. Different communication
protocols are available for various applica-
tions (e.g., KWP2000, McMess).

Communication Vehicle Interface, COV

looks after communication with other
ECUs, sensors and actuators. 

Communication Security Access, COS
 provides for communication with the im-
mobilizer and – as an option – enables
 access control for reprogramming the 
Flash-EPROM.

Accessory Control (AC)
The Accessory Control subsystem controls
the auxiliary systems.

Accessory Control Air Condition, ACA con-
trols operation of the A/C compressor and
analyzes the signals from the pressure sensor
in the air conditioner. The A/C compressor
is switched on when, for example, a request
is received from the driver or the A/C ECU
via a switch. The A/C ECU signals to the
Motronic that the A/C compressor needs to
be switched on. It is switched on shortly af-
terwards. When the engine is idling, the en-
gine-management system has sufficient time
to develop the required torque reserves.

Various conditions can result in the air
conditioner being switched off (e.g., critical
pressure in the air conditioner, fault in the
pressure sensor, low ambient temperature).

Microcontroller Monitoring, MOC combines
all the monitoring functions that can detect
a fault or malfunction in the processor and
its peripherals. Examples include:
(cid:2) Analog-digital converter test 
(cid:2) Memory test for RAM and ROM
(cid:2) Program-run monitoring
(cid:2) Command test

Extended Monitoring, MOX contains func-
tions for expanded function monitoring.
These function determine the maximal
torque which the engine can plausibly
 output.

Diagnostic System (DS)
Component and system diagnosis are per-
formed by the main functions of the subsys-
tems. The Diagnostic System (DS) is respon-
sible for coordinating the various diagnosis
results. 

The function of the Diagnostic System

Manager (DSM) is to: 
(cid:2) Store details of faults and associated 

ambient conditions

(cid:2) Switch on the malfunction indicator lamp
(cid:2) Establish communication with the diag-

nostic tester

(cid:2) Coordinate execution of the various diag-
nostic functions (taking account of priori-
ties and bars) and verify faults

Accessory Control Fan Control, ACF controls
the radiator fan in response to demand and
detects faults in the fan and the control sys-
tem. Under certain circumstances, the fan
may be required to run on when the engine
is not running. 

Accessory Control Thermal Management,
ACT regulates the engine temperature ac-
cording to operating conditions. The re-
quired engine temperature is determined
depending on engine power, driving speed,
engine operating state, and ambient temper-
ature. This helps the engine to reach its
 operating temperature more quickly and 
is then adequately cooled. The coolant volu-
metric flow through the radiator is calcu-
lated and the map-controlled thermostat is
operated accordingly based on the tempera-
ture setpoint.

Accessory Control Electrical Machines, ACE

is responsible for controlling the “electrical
machines”, i.e. the starter motor and alterna-
tor.

The function Accessory Control Steering,
ACS is to control the power-steering pump.

Monitoring (MO)
Function Monitoring, MOF monitors all
Motronic elements that affect engine torque
and speed. The core function is torque com-
parison. This compares the permissible
torque calculated on the basis of driver
 request with the actual torque calculated
from the engine data. If the actual torque 
is too large, suitable measures are initiated 
to  ensure that a controllable status is re-
 established.

Monitoring Module, MOM combines all
the monitoring functions that contribute to
or perform reciprocal monitoring between
the function processor and the monitoring
module. The function processor and the
monitoring module are components of the
ECU. Reciprocal monitoring between them
takes place by means of continuous query-
and-response communication.

Sensors

Automotive applications

Sensors

Sensors register operating states (e.g. engine
speed) and setpoint/desired values (e.g.
 accelerator-pedal position). They convert
physical quantities (e.g. pressure) or chemi-
cal quantities (e.g. exhaust-gas concen -
tration) into electric signals. 

Automotive applications

Sensors and actuators represent the interfaces
between the ECUs, as the processing units,
and the vehicle with its complex drive, brak-
ing, chassis, and bodywork functions (for in-
stance, the Engine Management, the Elec-
tronic Stability Program ESP, and the air con-
ditioner). As a rule, a matching circuit in the
sensor converts the signals so that they can be
processed by the ECU.

The field of mechatronics, in which mech -
anical, electronic, and data-processing
 components are interlinked and cooperate
closely with each other, is rapidly gaining in
importance in the field of sensor engineering.
These components are integrated in modules
(e.g. in the crankshaft CSWS (Composite 
Seal with Sensor) module  complete with rpm
sensor).

1

Sensor integration levels

Since their output signals directly affect not
only the engine’s power output, torque, and
emissions, but also vehicle handling and
safety, sensors, although they are becoming
smaller and smaller, must also fulfill demands
that they be faster and more precise. These
stipulations can be complied with thanks to
mechatronics.

Depending upon the level of integration, sig-
nal conditioning, analog/digital conversion,
and self-calibration functions can all be inte-
grated in the sensor (Fig. 1), and in future a
small microcomputer for further signal pro-
cessing will be added. The advantages are as
follows: 
(cid:2) Lower levels of computing power are

needed in the ECU

(cid:2) A uniform, flexible, and bus-compatible 
interface becomes possible for all sensors

(cid:2) Direct multiple use of a given sensor

through the data bus

Temperature sensors

Applications
Engine-temperature sensor
This is installed in the coolant circuit
(Fig. 1). The engine management uses its
signal when calculating the engine tempera-
ture (measuring range – 40...+ 130 °C).

Exhaust-gas temperature sensor
This sensor is mounted on the exhaust sys-
tem at points which are particularly critical
regarding temperature. It is applied in the
closed-loop control of the systems used for
exhaust-gas treatment. A platinum measur-
ing resistor is usually used (measuring range
– 40...+ 1000 °C).

Air-temperature sensor
This sensor is installed in the air-intake
tract. Together with the signal from the
boost-pressure sensor, its signal is applied in
calculating the intake-air mass. Apart from
this, desired values for the various control
loops (e.g. EGR, boost-pressure control) 
can be adapted to the air temperature
 (measuring range – 40...+ 120 °C).

Engine-oil temperature sensor
The signal from this sensor is used in calcu-
lating the service interval (measuring range
– 40...+ 170 °C).

Fuel-temperature sensor
Is incorporated in the low-pressure stage 
of the diesel fuel circuit. The fuel tempera-
ture is used in calculating the precise in-
jected fuel quantity (measuring range
– 40...+ 120 °C).

Design and method of operation
Depending upon the particular application,
a wide variety of temperature sensor designs
are available. A temperature-dependent
semiconductor measuring resistor is fitted
inside a housing. This resistor is usually 
of the NTC (Negative Temperature Coeffi-
cient, Fig. 2) type. Less often a PTC (Positive
Temperature Coefficient) type is used. With
NTC, there is a sharp drop in  resistance
when the temperature rises, and with PTC
there is a sharp increase.

The measuring resistor is part of a voltage-
divider circuit to which 5 V is applied. 
The voltage measured across the measuring
 resistor is therefore temperature-dependent.
 It is inputted through an analog to digital
(A/D) converter and is a measure of the
temperature at the sensor. A characteristic
curve is stored in the engine-management
ECU which allocates a specific temperature
to every resistance or output-voltage.

Engine-speed sensors

Engine-speed sensors 

Application
Engine-speed sensors are used in Motronic
systems for
(cid:2) Measuring the engine speed, and
(cid:2) Determining the crankshaft position
 (position of the engine pistons)

The rotational speed is calculated from the
internal between the sensor’s signals. 

Inductive speed sensors
Design and method of operation
The sensor is mounted directly opposite a
ferromagnetic trigger wheel (Fig. 1, Pos. 7)
from which it is separated by a narrow air
gap. It has a soft-iron core (pole pin, Pos. 4),
which is enclosed by a winding (5). The pole
pin is also connected to a permanent magnet
(1), and a magnetic field extends through the
pole pin and into the trigger wheel. The level
of the magnetic flux through the coil de-
pends on whether the sensor is opposite 
a trigger-wheel tooth or gap. Whereas the
magnet’s leakage flux is concentrated by a
tooth, and leads to an increase in the work-
ing flux through the coil, it is weakened by 
a gap. When the trigger wheel rotates, these
magnetic-flux changes induce a sinusoidal
output voltage in the coil which is propor-
tional to the rate of change of the flux and
thus the engine speed (Fig. 2). The ampli-

tude of the alternating voltage increases
sharply along with increasing trigger-wheel
speed (several mV... >100 V). At least about
30 rpm are needed to generate an adequate
amplitude. 

The number of teeth on the trigger wheel
depends on the particular application. 
In Motronic systems, a 60-pitch trigger
wheel is normally used, although 2 teeth 
are omitted (7) so that the trigger wheel has
60 – 2 = 58 teeth. The gap where the missing
teeth would be situated is allocated to a de-
fined crankshaft position and serves as a ref-
erence mark for synchronizing the ECU.

The geometries of the trigger-wheel teeth

and the pole pin must be matched to each
other. An evaluation circuit in the ECU con-
verts the sinusoidal voltage, which is charac-
terized by strongly varying amplitudes, into
a constant-amplitude square-wave voltage
for evaluation in the ECU microcontroller.

Active speed sensors
Active speed sensors operate according to
the magnetostatic principle. The amplitude
of the output signal is not dependent on the
rotational speed. This makes it possible for
very low speeds to be sensed (quasistatic
speed sensing).

Differential Hall-effect sensor
A voltage UH proportional to the magnetic
field (Hall voltage) can be picked off hori-
zontally to the current direction at a cur-
rent-carrying plate which is permeated ver-
tically by a magnetic induction B (Fig. 3). 
In a differential Hall-effect sensor, the mag-
netic field is generated by a permanent mag-
net (Fig. 4, Pos. 1). Two Hall-effect sensor
 elements (2 and 3) are situated between the
magnet and the trigger wheel (4). The mag-
netic flux by which these are permeated de-
pends on whether the sensor is opposite a
tooth or a gap. By establishing the difference
between the signals from the two sensors, 
it is possible to

(cid:2) Reduce magnetic interference signals, and
(cid:2) Obtain an improved signal-to-noise ratio

The edges of the sensor signal can be pro -
cessed without digitization directly in the
ECU. 

Multipole wheels are used instead of the
ferromagnetic trigger wheel. Here, a magne-
tizable plastic is attached to a non-magnetic
metallic carrier and alternately magnetized.
These north and south poles adopt the func-
tion formerly performed by the teeth of the
trigger wheel. 

AMR sensors
The electrical resistance of magnetoresistive
material (AMR, Anisotropic Magneto Resis-
tive) is anisotropic, i.e., it depends on the
 direction of the magnetic field to which it 
is exposed. This property is utilized in an
AMR sensor. The sensor is located between 
a magnet and a trigger wheel. The field lines
change direction when the trigger wheel
 rotates (Fig. 5). This generates a sinusoidal
voltage, which is amplified in an evaluation
circuit in the sensor and converted into a
square-wave signal.

The engine’s camshaft rotates at half the

The phase sensor on the camshaft provides
the ECU with this information. This is re-
quired, for example, for ignition systems
with single-spark ignition coils and for
 Sequential fuel injection (SEFI).

Design and method of operation
Hall-effect rod sensors
Hall-effect rod sensors (Fig. 1a) utilize the
Hall effect: A rotor made ferromagnetic
 material (Pos. 7, trigger wheel with teeth,
segments or aperture plate) rotates along
with the camshaft. The Hall-effect IC (6) 
is located between the trigger wheel and 
a permanent magnet (5), which generates 
a magnetic field strength perpendicular to
the Hall-effect element. 

If one of the trigger-wheel teeth (Z) now
passes the current-carrying sensor element
(semiconductor plate), it changes the mag-
netic-field strength perpendicular to the
Hall-effect element. This results in a voltage
signal (Hall voltage) which is independent 
of the relative speed between sensor and
trigger wheel. The evaluation electronics
 integrated in the sensor’s Hall-effect IC
 conditions the signal and outputs it in the
form of a square-wave signal (Fig. 1b).

Miniaturization

Thanks to micromechanics it has become pos-
sible to locate sensor functions in the smallest
possible space. Typically, the mechanical di-
mensions are in the micrometer range. Silicon,
with its special characteristics, has proved to
be a highly suitable material for the production
of the very small, and often very intricate me-
chanical structures. With its elasticity and
electrical properties, silicon is practically ideal
for the production of sensors. Using process-
es derived from the field of semiconductor en-
gineering, mechanical and electronic functions
can be integrated with each other on a single
chip or using other methods. 

(cid:7)

Micromechanical acceleration sensor

Bosch was the first to introduce a product
with a micromechanical measuring element for
automotive applications. This was an intake-
pressure sensor for measuring load, and went
into series production in 1994. Micromechani-
cal acceleration and yaw-rate sensors are
more recent developments in the field of
miniaturisation, and are used in driving-safety
systems for occupant protection and vehicle
dynamics control (Electronic Stability Program,
ESP). The illustrations below show quite clear-
ly just how small such components really are.

Hot-film air-mass meter

Hot-film air-mass meter 

Application
To provide precise pilot control of the
air/fuel ratio, it is essential for the supplied
air mass to be exactly determined in the
 respective operating state. The hot-film air-
mass meter measures some of the actually
inducted air-mass flow for this purpose. 
It takes into account the pulsations and
 reverse flows caused by the opening and
closing of the engine’s intake and exhaust
valves. Intake-air temperature or air-pres-
sure changes have no effect upon measuring
accuracy.

HFM5 design
The housing of the HFM5 hot-film air-mass
meter (Fig. 1, Pos. 5) extends into a measur-
ing tube (2), which can have different dia -
meters depending on the air mass required
for the engine (370 ... 970 kg/h).

The measuring tube normally contains a
flow rectifier, which ensures that the flow 
in the measuring tube is uniform. The flow
rectifier is either a combination of a plastic
mesh with straightening action and a wire
mesh, or is a wire mesh on its own (Fig. 3,
Pos. 8). The measuring tube is installed in
the intake tract downstream from the air
 filter. Plug-in versions are also available
which are installed inside the air filter.

The most important components in the
 sensor are the measuring cell (Fig. 1, Pos. 4)
in the air inlet (8) and the integrated evalua-
tion electronics (3). 

The sensor measuring cell consists of 
a semiconductor substrate. The sensitive
surface is formed by a diaphragm which 
has been manufactured in micromechanical
processes. This diaphragm incorporates
temperature-sensitive resistors. The ele-
ments of the evaluation electronics (hybrid
circuit) are installed on a ceramic substrate.
This principle permits very compact design.
The evaluation electronics is connected 
to the ECU by means of electrical connec-
tions (1). 

The partial-flow measuring passage (6) 
is shaped so that the air flows past the mea-
suring cell smoothly (without whirl effects)
and back into the measuring tube via the air
outlet (7). The length and location of the in-
let and outlet of the partial-flow measuring
passage have been chosen to provide good
sensor performance even in the event of
sharply pulsating flows. 

Method of operation
The HFM5 hot-film air-mass meter is a
thermal sensor which operates according 
tot he following principle: A centrally situ-
ated heating resistor on the measuring cell 
(Fig. 3, Pos. 3) heats a sensor diaphragm (5)
and maintains it at a constant temperature.
The temperature drops sharply on each side
of this controlled heating zone (4). 

Sensors

Hot-film air-mass meter

241

The temperature distribution on the dia -
phragm is registered by two temperature-
 dependent resistors which are mounted
 upstream and downstream of the heating
 resistor so as to be symmetrical to it (mea-
suring points M1, M2). Without the flow of
incoming air, the temperature profile (1) is
the same on each side of the heating zone
(T1 = T2). 

As soon as air flows over the measuring
cell, the uniform temperature profile at the
diaphragm changes (2). On the inlet side,
the temperature characteristic is steeper
since the incoming air flowing past this 
area cools it off. On the opposite side, the
temperature characteristic only changes
slightly, because the incoming air flowing
past has been heated by the heater element.
The change in temperature distribution
leads to a temperature differential (ΔT)
 between the measuring points M1 and M2.
The heat dissipated to the air, and there-

fore the temperature characteristic at the
measuring cell is dependent on the air mass
flowing past. The temperature differential is
(irrespective of the absolute temperature of
the air flow past) a measure of the air-flow
mass. It is also direction-dependent so that
the air-mass sensor can record both the
amount and the direction of an air-mass
flow. Due to its very thin micromechanical
diaphragm, the sensor has a highly dynamic
response (< 15 ms), a point which is of par-
ticular importance when the incoming air 
is pulsating heavily.

The evaluation electronics integrated in
the sensor converts the resistance differential
at the measuring points M1 and M2 into an
analog voltage signal of between 0 and 5 V.
Using the sensor characteristic (Fig. 2)
stored in the ECU, the measured voltage 
is converted into a value representing the
air-mass flow (kg/h). 

The shape of the characteristic curve is
such that the diagnosis facility incorporated
in the ECU can detect such malfunctions as
an open-circuit line. An additional tempera-
ture sensor for evaluation functions can be

integrated in the HFM5. It is not required
for measuring the air mass. 

Incorrect air-mass readings will be regis-

tered if the sensor diaphragm is contami-
nated with dust, dirty water or oil. For the

purpose of increasing the robustness of the
HFM5, a protective device has been devel-
oped which, in conjunction with a deflector
mesh, keeps dirty water and dust away 
from the sensor element (HFM5-CI; with 
C-shaped bypass and inner tube (I), which
together with the deflector mesh protects 
the sensor). 

HFM6 hot-film air-mass meter
The HFM6 uses the same sensor element as
the HFM5 and has the same basic design. 
It differs in two crucial points:
(cid:2) The integrated evaluation electronics op-
erates digitally in order to obtain greater
measuring accuracy

(cid:2) The design of the partial-flow measuring
passage is altered to provide protection
against contamination directly upstream
of the sensor element (similar to the
 deflector mesh in the HFM5-CI)

Digital electronics
A voltage signal is generated with a bridge
circuit from the resistance values at the mea-
suring points M1 and M2 (Fig. 3); this volt-
age signal serves as the measure of the air
mass. The signal is converted into digital
form for further processing. 

4

HFM6 with improved contamination protection

2

The HFM6 also takes into account the tem-
perature of the intake air when determining
the air mass. This increases significantly the
accuracy of the air-mass measurement. 

The intake-air temperature is measured by 
a temperature-dependent resistor, which 
is integrated in the closed control loop for
monitoring the heating-zone temperature.
The voltage drop at this resistor produces
with the aid of an analog-digital converter 
a digital signal representing the intake-air
temperature. The signals for air mass and
intake-air temperature are used to address 
a program map in which the correction
 values for the air-mass signal are stored. 

Improved protection against contamination
The partial-flow measuring passage is di-
vided into two sections in order to provide
better protection against contamination
(Fig. 4). The passage which passes the sensor
element has a sharp edge (1), around which
air must flow. Heavy particulates and dirty-
water droplets are unable to follow this di-
version and are separated from the partial
flow. These contaminants exit the sensor
through a second passage (5). In this way,
significantly fewer dirt particulates and
droplets reach the sensor element (3) with
the result that contamination is reduced 
and the service life of the air-mass sensor is
significantly prolonged even when operated
with contaminated air.

Piezoelectric knock sensors

Piezoelectric knock sensors

Knock sensor (design and mounting)

Application
In terms of their principle of operation,
knock sensors are basically vibration sensors
and are suitable for detecting structure-
borne acoustic oscillations. These occur 
as “knock”, for instance, in gasoline engines
when uncontrolled combustion takes place.
They are converted by the knock sensor into
electrical signals (Fig. 1) and transmitted 
to the Motronic ECU, which counteracts 
the engine knock by adjusting the ignition
angle.

Design and method of operation
Due to its inertia, a mass (Fig. 2, Pos. 2)
 excited by a given oscillation or vibration
exerts a compressive force on a toroidal
piezoceramic element (1) at the same
 frequency as the excitation oscillation. 
These forces effect a charge transfer within
the ceramic element. An electrical voltage 
is generated between the top and bottom 
of the ceramic element which is picked off
via contact washers (5) and processed in 
the Motronic ECU.

Mounting
In four-cylinder engines, one knock sensor
is sufficient to record the knock signals for
all the cylinders. Engines with more cylin-
ders require two or more knock sensors. 
The knock-sensor installation point on the
engine is selected so that knock can be reli-
ably detected from each cylinder. The sensor
is usually bolted to the side of the engine
block. It must be possible for the generated
signals (structure-borne-noise vibrations) 
to be introduced without resonance into the
knock sensor from the measuring point on
the engine block. A fixed bolted connection
satisfying the following requirements is re-
quired for this purpose:
(cid:2) The fastening bolts must be tightened 

to a defined torque 

(cid:2) The contact surface and the bore in the

engine block must comply with prespeci-
fied quality requirements

(cid:2) No washers of any type may be used for

fastening purposes

Sensors

Micromechanical pressure sensors

Method of operation
The diaphragm of the sensor cell is deflected
to varying degrees depending on the external
pressure acting on it (the center of the dia -
phragm is deflected by 10...1000 μm). The
four deformation resistors on the diaphragm
change their electrical resistance as a func-
tion of the mechanical stress resulting from
the applied pressure (piezoresistive effect).

The four measuring resistors are arranged
on the silicon chip so that when diaphragm
deformation takes place, the resistance of
two of them increases and that of the other
two decreases. These measuring resistors 
are arranged in a Wheatstone bridge circuit
(Fig. 1b) and a change in their resistance

Application
Pressure is a non-directional force acting 
in all directions which occurs in gases and
liquids. Micromechanical pressure sensors
detect the pressure of various media in the
motor vehicle, e.g.: 
(cid:2) Intake-manifold pressure, e.g., for load
sensing in engine-management systems
(cid:2) Charge-air pressure for boost-pressure

control

air density, e.g., in boost-pressure control

(cid:2) Oil pressure for taking into account en-

gine load in the service display

(cid:2) Fuel pressure for monitoring the level 

of fuel-filter contamination

Micromechanical pressure sensors deter-
mine the absolute pressure of liquids and
gases by measuring the pressure differential
in relation to a reference vacuum. 

Version with the reference vacuum 
on the component side
Design
The measuring cell of a micromechanical
pressure sensor consists of a silicon chip
(Fig. 1a, Pos. 2), in which a thin diaphragm
is micromechanically etched (1). Four defor-
mation resistors (R1, R2) are diffused into
the diaphragm. The electrical resistance in
these resistors changes in response to me-
chanical elongation. The measuring cell is
surrounded and sealed on its component
side by a cap (Fig. 2, Pos. 6), which encloses
the reference vacuum underneath. 

A temperature sensor (Fig. 3, Pos. 1), 
the signals of which can be evaluated inde-
pendently, can also be integrated in the
 pressure-sensor housing.

The signal-conditioning electronic circuitry
is integrated on the chip. Its function is to
amplify the bridge voltage, compensate for
temperature influences, and linearize the
pressure curve. The output voltage is in the
range of 0...5 V and is supplied via electrical
connections to the engine ECU (Fig. 3, 
Pos. 5). The ECU uses this output voltage 
to calculate the pressure.

Version with the reference vacuum 
in a special chamber
Design
A pressure sensor with the reference vacuum
in a special chamber (Fig. 4) for use as an
 intake-manifold or boost-pressure sensor
is easier to install than a sensor with the
 reference vacuum on the component side: 
A silicon chip (Fig. 5, Pos. 6) with etched
 diaphragm and four deformation resistors in
a bridge circuit is located – like the pressure
sensor with cap and reference vacuum on the
component side – as a measuring cell on a
glass base (3). In contrast to the sensor with
the reference vacuum on the component
side, there is no passage in the glass base
through which the measured pressure can 
be applied to the sensor element. Instead,
pressure is applied to the silicon chip from
the side on which the evaluation electronics

 values leads to a change in the ratio of the
voltages across them. This leads to a change
in the measurement voltage UM. This as yet
unamplified voltage is therefore a measure
of the pressure applied to the diaphragm. 
The measurement voltage is higher with 
a bridge circuit than would be the case if an
individual resistor were used. The Wheat-
stone bridge circuit thus permits a higher
sensor sensitivity.

Sensors

Micromechanical pressure sensors, high-pressure sensors

High-pressure sensors

Application
High-pressure sensors are used in a motor
vehicle to measure fuel pressure and brake-
fluid pressure, e.g:
(cid:2) Rail-pressure sensor for gasoline direct
 injection (pressure up to 200 bar)
(cid:2) Rail-pressure sensor for common-rail
diesel-injection system (pressure up to
2000 bar)

(cid:2) Brake-fluid pressure sensor in the hy-
draulic modulator of the Electronic
 Stability Program (pressure up to 350 bar)

Design and method of operation
High-pressure sensors operate according 
to the same principle as micromechanical
pressure sensors. The core of the sensor is 
a steel diaphragm, onto which deformation
resistors have been vapor-deposited in the
form of a bridge circuit (Fig. 6, Pos. 3). 
The sensor’s measuring range is dependent
on the thickness of the diaphragm (thicker
diaphragms for higher pressures, thinner
 diaphragms for lower pressures). As soon 
as the pressure to be measured is applied to
one side of the diaphragm via the pressure
port (4), the deformation resistors change
their resistance values as a result of the
 deflection of the diaphragm. The output
voltage generated by the bridge circuit is
proportional to the applied pressure. This
voltage is transmitted via connecting leads
(bonding wires) to an evaluation circuit (2)
in the sensor. The evaluation circuit ampli-
fies the bridge signal to 0...5 V and transmits
it to the ECU, which calculates the pressure
with the aid of a characteristic curve.

is situated. This means that a special gel must
be used on this side of the sensor to protect 
it against environmental influences. The ref-
erence vacuum (5) is enclosed in the cavity
(special chamber) between the silicon chip
and the glass base. The complete measuring
element is mounted on a ceramic hybrid (4),
which incorporates the soldering surfaces for
electrical contacting inside the sensor.

A temperature sensor can also be incorpo-
rated in the pressure-sensor housing. It pro-
trudes into the air flow, and can therefore
respond to temperature changes with a
 minimum of delay (Fig. 4, Pos. 4).

Method of operation
The method of operation, and with it the
signal conditioning and signal amplification
together with the characteristic curve, corre-
spond to that used in the pressure sensor
with cap and reference vacuum on the com-
ponent side. The only difference is that the
measuring cell’s diaphragm is deformed in
the opposite direction and therefore the de-
formation resistors are “bent” in the other
direction.

(cid:3)

Micromechanics

Micromechanics is defined as the application
of semiconductor techniques in the pro -
duction of mechanical components from semi-
conductor materials (usually silicon). Not only
silicon’s semiconductor properties are used
but also its mechanical characteristics. This
enables sensor functions to be implemented
in the smallest-possible space. The following
techniques are used:

Bulk micromechanics
The silicon wafer material is processed at the
required depth using anisotropic (alkaline)
etching and, where needed, an electrochemi-
cal etching stop. From the rear, the material is
removed from inside the silicon layer (Fig. 1,
Pos. 2) at those points underneath an opening
in the mask. Using this method, very small
 diaphragms can be produced (with typical
thicknesses of between 5 and 50 μm, as well
as openings (b), beams and webs (c) as are
needed for instance for acceleration sensors. 

Surface micromechanics
The substrate material here is a silicon wafer
on whose surface very small mechanical struc-
tures are formed (Fig. 2). First of all, a “sacri -
ficial layer” is applied and structured using
semiconductor processes such as etching (A).
An approx. 10 μm polysilicon layer is then de-
posited on top of this (B) and structured verti-
cally using a mask and etching (C). In the final
processing step, the “sacrificial” oxide layer
underneath the polysilicon layer is removed 
by means of gaseous hydrogen fluoride (D). 
In this manner, the movable electrodes for
 acceleration sensors (Fig. 3) are exposed. 

Wafer bonding
Anodic bonding and sealglass bonding are
used to permanently join together (bonding)
two wafers by the application of tension and
heat or pressure and heat. This is needed for
the hermetic sealing of reference vacuums for
instance, and when protective caps must be
applied to safeguard sensitive structures.

Sensors

Two-step lambda oxygen sensors

Two-step lambda oxygen
sensors

Application
These sensors are used in gasoline engines
equipped with two-step lambda control.
They project between the engine exhaust
and the catalytic converter into the exhaust
pipe and simultaneously detect the exhaust-
gas flow from all the cylinders. Because the
lambda sensor is heated, it can be installed
further away from the engine so that even
extended periods of driving at full load pre-
sent no problems. The LSF4 sensor is also
suitable for use in exhaust systems with
 several sensors (e.g., OBD II).

Two-step lambda sensors compare the
residual-oxygen content in the exhaust gas
with the oxygen content in the reference
 atmosphere (surrounding air inside the
 sensor) and indicate whether a rich (λ < 1)
or lean mixture (λ > 1) is present in the
 exhaust gas. The sudden jump in the char -
acteristic curve of these sensors permits
mixture control to λ = 1 (Fig. 1).

Method of operation
Two-step lambda oxygen sensors operated
on the principle of a galvanic oxygen con-
centration cell with a solid electrolyte
(Nernst principle). The ceramic element 
is conductive for oxygen ions from a tem-
perature of approximately 350 °C (safe,
 reliable operation at > 350 °C). Due to the
abrupt change in the residual-oxygen con-
tent on the exhaust-gas side in the range of 
λ = 1 (e.g., 9 · 10–15 % vol. for λ = 0.99 and 
0.2 % vol. for λ = 1.01), the different oxygen
content on both sides of the sensor gener-
ates an electrical voltage between the two
boundary layers. This means that the oxygen
content in the exhaust gas can be used as a
measure of the air/fuel ratio. The integrated
heater ensures that the sensor functions even
at extremely low exhaust-gas temperatures.

The voltage output by the sensor US is
 dependent on the oxygen content in the
 exhaust gas. In the case of a rich mixture 
(λ < 1), it reaches 800...1000 mV, and, in the
case of a lean mixture (λ > 1), it reaches only
about 100 mV. The transition from rich to
lean occurs at Ureg = 450...500 mV. 

The temperature of the ceramic element
influences its ability to conduct the oxygen
ions, and thus the shape of the output-volt-
age curve as a function of the excess-air
 factor λ (the values in Fig. 1 are therefore
temperature-dependent). In addition, the
response time for a voltage change when 
the mixture composition changes is also
strongly dependent on temperature.

Whereas these response times at ceramic-
 element temperatures of below 350 °C are 
in the seconds range, the sensor responds at
optimum operating temperatures of around
600 °C in less than 50 ms. When an engine 
is started, therefore, lambda closed-loop
control is deactivated until the minimum
operating temperature of about 350 °C is
reached. During this period, the engine is
open-loop-controlled.

Design
LSH25 finger-type sensor
Sensor ceramic element with protective tube
The solid electrolyte is a ceramic element
which is impermeable to gas. It is composed
of a mixed oxide of the elements zirconium
and yttrium in the shape of a tube closed off
at one end (finger). The surfaces have been
provided on both sides with electrodes made
from a microporous, thin noble-metal
 coating. 

The platinum electrode on the exhaust side,
which protrudes into the exhaust pipe, acts
like a small catalytic converter: Exhaust gas
which reaches this electrode is treated cat-
alytically and brought to a stoichiometric
balance (λ = 1). In addition, the side that 
is exposed to the exhaust gas has a porous,
ceramic multiple layer (spinel layer) to pro-
tect it against contamination and erosive
damage. The ceramic element is also

The connecting cable is crimped to the
 contact element which protrudes from the
sensor, and is protected against moisture
and mechanical damage by a temperature-
resistant cap.

The finger-type sensor (Fig. 2) is also
equipped with an electrical heater element.
This ensures that the ceramic-element tem-
perature remains sufficiently high, even at
low engine load and thus low exhaust-gas
temperature.

This external heating is so quick that 
the sensor reaches operating temperature
20...30 s after the engine has started and
therefore lambda closed-loop control can
come into operation. Finally, sensor heating
provides for an optimal ceramic-element
operating temperature above the operating
limit of 350 °C and thus ensures low and
 stable exhaust-gas emissions.

 protected against mechanical impact and
thermal shocks by a metal tube. Various slots
in the protective tube are designed in such 
a way that they, on the one hand, provide
particularly effective protection and thermal
and chemical loads, and, on the other hand,
prevent the ceramic element from cooling
excessively when the exhaust gas is “cool”.

The sensor’s “open” inner chamber facing

away from the exhaust gas is connected to
the outside air, which acts as a reference gas
(Fig. 3).

A contact element between the support tube

The outer electrode is connected to the

A protective metal sleeve, which at the 
same time serves as the support for the 
disc spring, locates and fixes the sensor’s
complete inner structure. It also protects 
the sensor interior against contamination.

 ensures that the sensor heats up quickly even
in the event of low power input. 

The reference-air passage inside the LSF4
lambda sensor – operating as a reference-gas
sensor (Figs. 5 and 6) – has access to the
 ambient air. It can therefore compare the
residual oxygen in the exhaust gas with the
oxygen in the reference atmosphere, i.e., 
the ambient air inside the sensor. Thus, 
the planar-sensor voltage also demonstrates
an abrupt change (Fig. 1) in the area of the
 stoichiometric composition of the air/fuel
mixture (λ = 1).

LSF4 planar lambda sensor
In terms of its function, the planar lambda
sensor corresponds to the heated finger-type
sensors with a voltage-jump curve at λ = 1.
However, on the planar sensor, the solid
electrolyte is comprised of a number of in -
dividual laminated foils stacked one on top
of the other (Fig. 4). The sensor is protected
against thermal and mechanical influences
by a double-walled protective tube.

The planar ceramic element (measuring
cell and heater are integrated) is shaped like
a long stretched-out wafer with rectangular
cross-section. 

The surfaces of the measuring cell are
provided with a microporous noble-metal
coating, which also has a porous ceramic
coating on the exhaust-gas side to protect 
it against the erosive effects of the exhaust-
residues. The heater is a wave-shaped ele-
ment containing noble metal. It is integrated
and insulated in the ceramic wafer and

LSU4 planar broad-band lambda oxygen sensor

LSU4 planar broad-band
lambda oxygen sensor

Application
As its name implies, the broad-band lambda
sensor is used across a very extensive range
to determine the oxygen concentration in
the exhaust gas. The figures provided by the
sensor are an indication of the air/fuel ratio
in the combustion chamber. The excess-air
factor λ describes this air/fuel ratio.

The sensor projects into the exhaust pipe
and registers the exhaust-gas mass flow from
all cylinders. It is capable of making precise
measurements not only at the stoichiometric
point at λ = 1, but also in the lean (λ > 1)
and rich (λ < 1) ranges. In conjunction with
control electronics, it delivers an unmistak-
able, continuous electrical signal in the
range of 0.7 < λ < ∞ (air with 21 % O2) 
(Fig. 3). These characteristics enable the
broad-band lambda sensor to be used not
only in engine-management systems with
two-step control (λ = 1), but also in control
concepts with lean and rich air/fuel mix-
tures. This type of lambda sensor is there-
fore also suitable for lambda closed-loop
control with lean-burn concepts on gasoline
engines, as well as for diesel engines, gas-
powered engines and gas-powered central

heaters and water heaters (hence the Ger-
man designation LSU: Lambda-Sonde-
Universal = universal lambda sensor).

In a number of systems, several lambda
sensors are installed for even greater accu-
racy. Here, for instance, they are fitted up-
stream and downstream of the catalytic
 converter as well as in the individual exhaust
tracts (cylinder banks).

Design
The LSU4 broad-band lambda sensor (Fig. 2)
is a planar dual-cell limit-current sensor. It
features a measuring cell (Fig. 1) made of zir-
conium-dioxide ceramic (ZrO2), and is a com-
bination of a Nernst concentration cell (sensor
cell which functions in the same way as a two-
step lambda sensor) and an oxygen pump cell
for transporting the oxygen ions. The oxygen
pump cell (Fig. 1, Pos. 8) is arranged in rela-
tion to the Nernst concentration cell (7) in
such a way that there is a 10...50μm diffusion
gap (6). Here, there are two porous platinum
electrodes: one pump electrode and one
Nernst measuring electrode. The diffusion gap
is connected to the exhaust gas by way of a
gas-access passage (10). A porous diffusion
barrier (11) serves to limit the flow of oxygen
molecules from the exhaust gas. 

On the one side, the Nernst concentration

cell is connected to the surrounding atmo -

cell in order that the composition of the gas
in the diffusion gap remains constant at 
λ = 1. If the exhaust gas is lean, the pump cell
pumps the oxygen to the outside (positive
pump current). On the other hand, if the
 exhaust gas is rich, the oxygen (due to the de-
composition of CO2 and H2O at the exhaust-
gas electrode) is pumped from the surround-
ing exhaust gas and into the diffusion gap
(negative pump current). At λ = 1, no oxygen
needs to be transported, and the pump cur-
rent is zero. The pump current is proportio -
nal to the oxygen concentration in the ex-
haust gas and is thus a (non-linear) measure
of the excess-air factor λ (Fig. 3).

Pump current IP of a broad-band lambda sensor 
as a function of the exhaust-gas excess-air factor λ

sphere by a reference-air passage (5), and on
the other, it is connected to the exhaust gas
in the diffusion gap.

The sensor requires control-electronics
circuitry to generate the sensor signal and 
to regulator the sensor temperature. 

An integrated heater (3) heats the sensor
so that it quickly reaches the operating tem-
perature of 650...900 °C which is required for
a signal that can be evaluated. This function
drastically reduces the influence of the ex-
haust-gas temperature on the sensor signal.

Method of operation
The exhaust gas enters the actual measuring
chamber (diffusion gap) of the Nernst con-
centration cell through the pump cell’s small
gas-access passage. In order that the excess-
air factor λ can be adjusted in the diffusion
gap, the Nernst concentration cell compares
the gas in the diffusion gap with the ambient
air in the reference-air passage. 

The complete process proceeds as follows:

By applying the pump voltage UP across the
pump cell’s platinum electrodes, oxygen from
the exhaust gas can be pumped through the
diffusion barrier and into or out of the diffu-
sion gap. With the aid of the Nernst concen-
tration cell, an electronic circuit in the ECU
controls the voltage (UP) across the pump

Electronic control unit (ECU)

Operating conditions, design, data processing

Electronic control unit (ECU)

Digital technology furnishes an extensive
 array of options for open and closed-loop
control of automotive electronic systems. A
large number of parameters can be included
in the process to support optimal operation
of various systems. After receiving the electric
signals transmitted by the sensors, the ECU
processes these data in order to generate con-
trol signals for the actuators. The software
program for closed-loop control is stored in
the ECU’s memory. The program is executed
by a microcontroller. The ECU and its com-
ponents are referred to as hardware. The
Motronic ECU contains all of the algorithms
for open and closed-loop control needed to
govern the  engine-management processes (ig-
nition,  induction and mixture formation,
etc.).

Operating conditions

The ECU operates in an extremely harsh and
demanding environment. 
It is  exposed to
(cid:2) Extreme temperatures 

(ranging from – 40 to + 60...+ 125 °C)
 under normal operating conditions

(cid:2) Abrupt temperature variations
(cid:2) Exposure to fluids (oil, fuel, etc.)
(cid:2) The effects of moisture and
(cid:2) Mechanical stresses such as 

engine vibration

The engine-management ECU must continue
to perform flawlessly in the face of fluctua-
tions in electrical supply, during starts with a
weak battery (cold starts, etc.) as well as at
high voltages (surges in onboard electrical
system).

Other requirements arise from the need 
for EMC (Electro-Magnetic Compatibility).
The requirements for resistance to electro-
magnetic interference and for suppressing
EMI emissions from the system itself are both
very high.

Design

The printed-circuit board with the electrical
components (Fig. 1) is installed in a housing
of plastic or metal. A multipin plug connects
the ECU to the sensors, actuators and electri-
cal power supply. The high-power driver cir-
cuits that provide direct control of the actua-
tors are specially integrated within the hous-
ing to ensure effective heat transfer to the
housing and the surrounding air.

Most of the electronic components are
SMDs (Surface-Mounted Devices). This
 concept provides extremely efficient use 
of space in low-weight packages. Only the
power elements and the plugs are mounted
using conventional insertion technology.

Hybrid versions combining compact dimen-
sions with extreme resistance to thermal at-
tack are available for mounting directly on
the engine.

Data processing

Input signals
The sensors join the actuators as the peri -
pheral components linking the vehicle and
the central processing device, the engine-
management ECU. The electrical signals from
the sensors travel through the wiring harness
and the plug to reach the control unit. These
signals can be in various forms: 

Analog input signals
Analog input signals can have any voltage
level within a specific range. Samples of phys-
ical parameters monitored as analog data in-
clude induction air mass, battery voltage and
intake-manifold pressure (including boost
pressure) as well as the temperatures of the
coolant and induction air. An analog/digital
(A/D) converter within the control unit’s mi-
crocontroller transforms the signal data into
the digital form required by the microcon-
troller’s central processing unit. The maxi-
mum resolution of these  analog signals is

5 mV. This translates into roughly 1000 incre-
mental graduations based on an overall mon-
itoring range of 0...5 V.

Digital input signals
Digital input signals have only two condi-
tions: high (logical 1) and low (logical 0).
Samples of digital input signals are switch
control signals (on/off) and digital sensor 
signals such as the rotational-speed pulses
from Hall-effect and magnetoresistive sen-
sors. The microcontroller can process these
 signals  without prior conversion.

Pulse-shaped input signals
The pulse-shaped input signals with informa-
tion on rpm and reference marks transmitted
by inductive sensors are conditioned in spe-
cial circuitry within the ECU. In this process
interference pulses are suppressed while the
actual signal pulses are converted to digital
square-wave signals.

Signal conditioning
Protective circuits limit the voltages of in-
coming signals to levels suitable for condition-
ing. Most of the superimposed interference
signals are removed from the useful  signal by
filters. When necessary, the useful signals are
then amplified to the input voltage required
by the microcontroller (0...5 V).

Some or all of this initial conditioning can
be carried out in the sensor itself, depending
upon its level of integration. 

Signal processing
The ECU is the switching center  governing 
all of the functions and sequences regulated
by the engine-management system. The con-
trol algorithms are executed by the  micro -
controller. The input signals from  sensors and
interfaces linking other systems (from CAN
bus, etc.) serve as the input parameters. The
processor runs backup plausibility checks 
on these data. The ECU program supports
calculation of the output  signals used to 
control the actuators.

Electronic control unit (ECU)

Data processing

Microcontroller
The microcontroller is the central component
of a control unit and controls its operative se-
quence (Fig. 2). Apart from the CPU (Central
Processing Unit), the microcontroller con-
tains not only the input and output channels,
but also timer units, RAMs, ROMs, serial in-
terfaces, and further peri pheral assemblies, 
all of which are integrated on a single micro-
chip. Quartz-controlled timing is used for the
microcontroller.

Program and data memory
In order to carry out the computations, 
the microcontroller needs a program – 
the “software”. This is in the form of binary
numerical values arranged in data records
and stored in a program memory. 

These binary values are accessed by the
CPU which interprets them as commands
which it implements one after the other.

This program is stored in a Read Only Mem-
ory (ROM, EPROM, or Flash-EPROM)
which also contains variant-specific data 
(individual data, characteristic curves, and
maps). This is non-variable data which
 cannot be changed during vehicle operation. 
lt is used to regulate the program’s open 
and closed-loop control processes.

The program memory can be integrated in
the microcontroller and, depending upon the
particular application, extended in a separate
component (e.g. an external EPROM or a
Flash-EPROM).

ROM
Program memories can be in the form of 
a ROM (Read Only Memory). This is a mem-
ory whose contents have been defined perma-
nently during manufacture and thereafter re-
main unalterable. The ROM installed in the
microcontroller only has a restricted memory
capacity, which means that an additional
ROM is required in case of complicated 
applications.

ply (continuous power supply). If the battery
is disconnected, however, the information
will nevertheless be lost.

EEPROM (also known as the E2PROM)
Data that must not be lost even if the battery
is disconnected (e.g. important adaptation
data, codes for the immobilizer) must be 
permanently stored in a nonvolatile, non-
erasable memory. The EEPROM is an electri-
cally erasable EPROM in which (in contrast
to the Flash-EPROM) every single memory
location can be erased individually. There-
fore, the EEPROM can be used as a non-
volatile random-access memory. 

Some control-unit variants also use sepa-
rately erasable areas of the Flash-EPROM as
nonvolatile memories. 

ASIC
The ever-increasing complexity of ECU func-
tions means that the computing powers of
the standard microcontrollers available on
the market no longer suffice. The solution
here is to use so-called ASIC modules (Appli -
cation Specific  Integrated Circuit). These IC’s
are designed and produced in  accordance
with data from the ECU development depart-
ments and, as well as being equipped with an
extra RAM for instance, and inputs and out-
puts, they can also generate and transmit
pwm signals.

Monitoring module
The ECU is provided with a monitoring
module. Using a “Question and Answer” 
cycle, the microcontroller and the monitoring
module supervise each other, and as soon 
as a fault is detected one of them  triggers 
appropriate back-up functions  independent
of the other.

EPROM
The data on an EPROM (Erasable Program-
mable ROM) can be erased by subjecting 
the device to UV light. Fresh data can then 
be entered using a programming unit. 
The EPROM is usually in the form of a
 separate component, and is accessed by 
the CPU through the Address/Data-Bus.

Flash-EPROM (FEPROM)
The contents of the Flash-EPROM can be
electrically erased. In the process, the ECU 
is connected to the reprogramming unit
through a serial interface.

lf the microcontroller is also equipped 
with a ROM, this contains the programming
routines for the Flash programming. 
Flash-EPROMs are available which, together
with the microcontroller, are integrated on a
single microchip.

Its decisive advantages have helped the

Flash-EPROM to largely supersede the
 conventional EPROM.

Variable-data or main memory
Such a read/write memory is needed in order
to store such variable data (variables) as the
computational and signal values.

RAM
Instantaneous values are stored in the RAM
(Random Access Memory) read/write mem-
ory. If complex applications are involved, the
memory capacity of the RAM incorporated
in the microcontroller is insufficient so that
an additional RAM module becomes neces-
sary. It is connected to the ECU through the
Address/Data-Bus.

When the control unit is disconnected
from the power supply, all data stored in 
the RAM is lost (volatile memory). However,
the next time the engine is started the control
unit has to have access to adaptation data
(learned data relating to engine condition
and operating status). That information must
not be lost when the ignition is switched off.
In order to prevent that happening, the RAM
is permanently connected to the power sup-

258

Electronic control unit (ECU)

Data processing

Output signals
With its output signals, the microcontroller
triggers driver stages which are usually
 powerful enough to operate the actuators di-
rectly. For particularly high power consumers
(e.g. radiator fan) some driver stages can also
operate relays.

The driver stages are proof against shorts
to ground or battery voltage, as well as against
destruction due to electrical or thermal over-
load. Such malfunctions, together with open-
circuit lines or sensor faults are identified by
the driver-stage IC as an error and reported
to the microcontroller.

Switching signals
These are used to switch the actuators on and
off (for instance, for the engine fan).

PWM signals
Digital output signals can be in the form 
of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) signals.
Such “pulse-width modulated” signals are
square-wave signals with a constant fre-
quency and variable signal duration (Fig. 3).
These signals can be used to move a variety of
actuators (e.g. exhaust recirculation valve,
turbocharger actuator) to any desired work-
ing position. 

Communication within the ECU 
In order to be able to support the microcon-
troller in its work, the peripheral components
must communicate with it. This takes place
using an address/data bus which, for instance,
the microcomputer uses to issue the RAM 
address whose contents are to be accessed.
The data bus is then used to transmit the 
relevant data. For former automotive applica-
tions, an 8-bit structure sufficed whereby the
data bus comprised 8 lines which together
can transmit 256 values simultaneously. 
The 16-bit address bus commonly used with
such systems can access 65,536 addresses.
Presently, more complex systems demand 
16 bits, or even 32 bits, for the data bus. In 
order to save on pins at the components, the
data and address buses can be combined in a
multiplex system. 
That is, data and addresses are dispatched
through the same lines but offset from each
other with respect to time. 

Serial interfaces with only a single data line
are used for data which need not be transmit-
ted so quickly (e.g. data from the fault stor-
age).

EoL programming
The extensive variety of vehicle variants with
differing control programs and data records,
makes it imperative to have a system which
reduces the number of ECU types needed 
by a given manufacturer. To that end, the
Flash-EPROM’s entire memory area can be
programmed at the end of the production
line with the program and the variant-
 specific data record (this is referred to as 
End-of-Line, or EoL, programming). 

A further means of reducing variant diver-

sity is to have a number of data variants 
(e.g. gearbox variants) stored in the memory,
which can then be selected by encoding at 
the end of the production line. This coding is
stored in an EEPROM.

Performance of electronic control units

(cid:3)

Performance of electronic control units

The performance of Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) goes hand-in-hand with advances
achieved in the field of microelectronics. 
The first gasoline fuel-injection systems used
analog technology and as such, they were not
so versatile when it came to implementing
control functions. These functions were con-
strained by the hardware.

Progress advanced in quantum leaps with
the arrival of digital technology and the micro-
controller. The entire engine management
 system was taken over by the universally ap-
plicable semiconductor microchip. In micro-
controller-based systems, the actual control
logic is accommodated on a programmable
semiconductor memory chip. 

From systems that initially simply controlled
fuel injection, complex engine-management sys-
tems were then developed. They controlled not
only fuel injection but also the ignition system in-
cluding knock control, exhaust-gas recirculation
and a whole variety of other systems. This con-
tinuous process of development is bound to
continue in a similar vein over the next decade
as well. The integration of functions and, above
all, their complexity are constantly increasing.
This pattern of development is only possible
 because the microcontrollers used are also
 undergoing a similar process of improvement. 
For a long time microcontrollers of the 
Intel 8051 family were used until they were
 superseded at the end of the 1980s by the

1

Development of electronic control units

80515 series which had extra input/output ca-
pabilities for timed signals and an integrated
analog-digital converter. It was then possible
to create relatively powerful systems. Figure 1
shows a comparison between the perfor-
mance of a fuel-injection system (LH3.2) and
an ignition system (EZ129K) – equipped with
80C515 controllers – and that of the succeed-
ing Motronic systems. With a clock speed of
40 MHz, the ME7 has almost 40 times the
processing power of the LH/EZ combination.
With the benefit of a new generation of micro-
controllers and a further increase in clock fre-
quency on the ME9, this figure will increase 
to a factor of well over 50.

In the foreseeable future microcontrollers

will process more than just digital control
 sequences. They will have integrated signal
processors that will be able to process signals
directly, such as signals from the engine-knock
sensors, for example. 

Advances in the development of semiconduc-
tor memory chips are also worthy of note.
Complex control programs require an enor-
mous amount of memory space. The capacity
of memory chips at the start of the 1980s 
was still only 8 kilobytes. The ME7 now uses
1-megabyte chips and soon memory capaci-
ties of 2 megabytes will be required. Figure 1
shows this pattern of development and likely
future trends.

Exhaust emissions

Combustion of the air/fuel mixture

Exhaust emissions

The past few years have witnessed a drastic
reduction in pollutant emissions from mo-
tor vehicles through the application of tech-
nical measures. In the case of passenger cars
with gasoline engines, a significant role has
been played by vehicles equipped with
three-way catalytic converters.

Figure 1 illustrates the decrease in annual
emissions from passenger cars. Only CO2
 experienced no significant decrease, and this
is  explained by the fact that CO2 emissions 
are proportional to fuel consumption. It is
therefore only possible to lower these emis-
sions by reducing fuel consumption or by
using lower-carbon fuels, such as natural gas.

The percentage contribution by motor
 vehicles to the total emissions generated 
by industry, traffic, households and power
stations varies for the different substances
and is as follows 1)
(cid:2) 52 % for nitrous oxides
(cid:2) 48 % for carbon monoxide
(cid:2) 19 % for carbon dioxide
(cid:2) 18 % for non-methane volatile hydro -

carbons

Combustion of the 
air/fuel mixture

If a pure fuel were to be fully combusted un-
der ideal conditions with sufficient oxygen,
only water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide
(CO2) would be created according to the fol-
lowing chemical reaction:

n1CXHY + m1O2 (cid:2) n2H2O + m2CO2

Because of the non-ideal combustion con -
ditions in the combustion chamber (e.g.,
unvaporized fuel droplets) and the other
constituents of fuel (e.g., sulfur), sometimes
toxic by-products are also produced in ad -
dition to water and carbon dioxide in the
combustion process. 

The production of by-products is being
increasingly reduced by procedures for op -
timizing combustion and improving fuel
quality. The amount of CO2 produced,
 however, is entirely dependent on the car-
bon content of fuel even under ideal condi-
tions and can therefore not be influenced 
by combustion management.

the atmosphere has risen by roughly 30 % 
to today’s figure of 367 ppm. Reducing CO2
emissions by reducing fuel consumption is
therefore seen more and more as a matter 
of urgency. 

Nitrogen (N2)
Nitrogen makes up 78 % of air and is there-
fore its primary constituent. It plays virtually
no part in the combustion process and at
roughly 71 % makes up the majority of the
exhaust gas. 

Main constituents of 
exhaust gas

Water (H2O)
The hydrogen chemically bound within the
fuel burns with the oxygen in the air to form
water vapor, most of which condenses as 
it cools. This is the source of the exhaust
plume visible on cold days. Water makes 
up about 13 % of the exhaust gas.

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
During combustion, the carbon chemically
bound within the fuel produces carbon
dioxide (CO2), which makes up approxi-
mately 14 % of the exhaust gas. 

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless,  
non-toxic gas and occurs naturally in the
 atmosphere. It is not classed as a pollutant
with  regard to motor-vehicle exhaust emis-
sions. However, it is one of the substances
responsible for the greenhouse effect and 
the global climate change that this causes.
Since industrialization, the CO2 content in

Exhaust emissions

Pollutants

Pollutants

During combustion, the air-fuel mixture gen-
erates a number of by-products. With the en-
gine warmed to its normal operating temper-
ature and running with a stoichiometric mix-
ture composition (λ = 1), the proportion of
these by-products in the engine’s untreated
emissions (exhaust gas after combustion, but
before treatment) is about 1 % of the total 
exhaust-gas quantity. 
The most significant of these combustion 
by-products are
(cid:2) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:2) Hydrocarbons (HC), and 
(cid:2) Nitrous oxides (NOX) 

With the engine at normal operating temper-
ature, catalytic converters can convert these
pollutants at a rate of more than 99 % into
harmless substances. 

Carbon monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide results from incomplete
combustion of rich air/fuel mixtures due to
an air deficiency. Although carbon mono xide
is also produced during operation with excess
air, the concentrations are minimal, and 
stem from rich zones in the unhomogeneous
air/fuel mixture. Fuel droplets that fail to 
vaporize form pockets of rich mixture that 
do not combust completely.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odor-

less gas. In humans, it inhibits the ability of
the blood to absorb oxygen, thus leading to
poisoning.

Hydrocarbons (HC)
Hydrocarbons are the chemical compounds
of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). HC emis-
sions are caused by incomplete combustion of
the air/fuel mixture where there is an oxygen
deficiency. The combustion process also pro-
duces new hydrocarbon compounds not 
initially present in the original fuel (e.g.,
through the separation of extended mole cular
chains). 

Aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes,
alkines, and their cyclic derivatives) are virtu-
ally odorless. Cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(such as benzene, toluene, and polycyclic 
hydrocarbons) emit a discernible odor. 

Some hydrocarbons are considered to be
carcinogenic in the event of long-term expo-
sure. Partially oxidized hydrocarbons (e.g.,
aldehydes, ketones) emit an unpleasant odor.
The chemical products that result when these
substances are exposed to sunlight are also
considered to act as carcinogens in the event
of extended exposure to specified concentra-
tions.

Nitrous oxides (NOX)
Nitrous oxide is the generic term for com-
pounds of nitrogen and oxygen. Nitrous
 oxides are produced during all combustion
processes with air as a result of secondary re-
actions with the nitrogen contained in the air.
The main forms found in the exhaust gases
from internal-combustion engines are nitro-
gen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
with dinitrogen monoxide (N2O) also present
in small concentrations.

Nitrogen oxide (NO) is colorless and odor-

less and is slowly converted in air into nitro-
gen dioxide (NO2). Pure NO2 is a toxic, red-
dish-brown gas with pungent odor. NO2 can
induce irritation of the mucous membranes
when present in the concentrations found in
heavily polluted air.

Nitrous oxides play their part in damaging

woods and forests (acid rain) and creating
smog.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
Sulfur compounds in exhaust gases – primar-
ily sulfur dioxide – are produced by the sulfur
content in fuels. SO2 emissions are caused
only to a small extent by motor vehicles and
are not restricted by emission- control legisla-
tion.

Nevertheless, the production of sulfur
compounds must be avoided to the greatest
possible extent, since SO2 sticks to catalytic
converters (Three-Way Catalysts, TWC, NOX

Exhaust emissions

Pollutants

263

accumulator-type catalysts) and  poisons
them, i.e., reduces their reaction  capability. 

Like nitrous oxides, SO2 contributes to the
creation of acid rain, because it can be con-
verted in the atmosphere or after settling
into sulfuric or nitric acid. 

Particulates
Solids are created in the form of particulates
as a result of incomplete combustion. While
exhaust composition varies as a function of
combustion process and engine operating
condition, these particulates basically consist

of chains of carbon particles (soot) with an
extremely extended specific surface ratio.
Uncombusted and partly combusted hydro-
carbons form deposits on the soot, where
they are joined by aldehydes, with their
overpowering odor. Aerosol components
(minutely dispersed solids or fluids in gases)
and sulfates bond to the soot. The sulfates
result from the sulfur content in the fuel.

The problem of solids (particulates) in ex-

haust gas is primarily associated with diesel
engines. Levels of particulate emissions from
gasoline engines are negligible.

(cid:3)

Greenhouse effect

Short-wave solar radiation penetrates the
Earth’s atmosphere and continues to the
ground, where it is absorbed. This process
promotes warming in the ground, which then
radiates long-wave heat, or infrared energy. 
A portion of this radiation is reflected by the
atmosphere, causing the Earth to warm.

Without this natural greenhouse effect the
Earth would be an inhospitable planet with an
average temperature of – 18 °C. Greenhouse
gases within the atmosphere (water vapor,
carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dinitrogen
 oxide, aerosols and particulate mist) raise av-
erage temperatures to approximately + 15 °C.
Water vapor, in particular, retains substantial
amounts of heat. 

Carbon dioxide has risen substantially since

the dawn of the industrial age more than 

100 years ago an. The primary cause of this
increase has been the burning of coal and pe-
troleum products. In this process, the carbon
bound in the fuels is released in the form of
carbon dioxide.

The processes that influence the green-
house effect within the Earth’s atmosphere 
are extremely complex. While some scientists
maintain that anthropogenic emissions (i.e.,
caused by humans) are the primary cause of
climate change, this theory is challenged by
other experts, who believe that the warming 
of the Earth’s atmosphere is being caused by
increased solar activity.

There is, however, a large degree of una-
nimity in calling for reductions in energy use to
lower carbon-dioxide emissions and combat
the greenhouse effect.

Exhaust emissions

Factors affecting untreated emissions

Factors affecting untreated
emissions

The primary by-products when the air/fuel
mixture is combusted are the pollutants
NOX, CO and HC. The quantities of these
pollutants present in untreated exhaust gases
(post-combustion gases prior to exhaust
treatment) display major variations in re-
sponse to different kinds of engine opera-
tion. The excess-air factor λ and the mo-
ment of ignition have a crucial influence 
on the formation of pollutants. 

The catalytic-converter system converts
pollutants to the greatest possible extent so
that the emissions discharged by the vehicle
to atmosphere are far lower than the un-
treated emissions. In order to minimize the
discharged pollutants for tenable exhaust-
gas treatment, it is essential however to keep
untreated emissions as low as possible. 

Influencing factors
Air/fuel ratio
Another primary factor defining the engine’s
toxic emissions is the air/fuel ratio (excess-
air factor λ). To obtain maximum emissions
reductions from three-way catalytic convert-
ers, manifold-injection engines run on a
 stoichiometric air/fuel mixture (λ = 1) in
most operating ranges.

Engines with gasoline direct injection en-
gines can be operated in stratified-charge or
homogeneous mode, with selection varying
according to the engine operating point. 
In homogeneous mode, the system injects
fuel during the intake stroke to produce
conditions comparable to those encountered
with manifold injection. The system reverts
to this mode of operation in response to
 demand for high torque and at high engine
speeds. In this operating mode, the set ex-
cess-air factor is usually equal to or in the
immediate vicinity of λ = 1.

The fuel is not distributed evenly

throughout the entire combustion chamber
during stratified-charge operation. The de-
sired effect is achieved by waiting until 
the compression stroke to inject the fuel.

The mixture cloud formed at the center of
the combustion chamber should be as ho-
mogeneous as possible, with an excess-air
factor of λ = 1. Virtually pure air or an ex-
tremely lean mixture is present in the ex-
tremities of the combustion chamber. This
results in an overall ratio of λ > 1 (lean) for
the entire combustion chamber. 

Mixture formation
In the interests of optimal combustion effi-
ciency, the fuel destined for combustion
should be thoroughly dispersed to form the
most homogeneous mixture possible with
the air. In manifold-injection engines, this
refers to the overall combustion chamber,
while in engines with gasoline direct injec-
tion this refers only to the stratified-charge
cloud in the center of the combustion
 chamber.

Consistent distribution of uniform mix-

ture to all cylinders is important for low
 pollutant emissions. Fuel-injection systems
that employ their intake manifolds exclu-
sively to transport air ensure consistent mix-
ture distribution by discharging fuel into 
the intake port directly in front of the intake
valve (manifold injection) or directly into
the combustion chamber (gasoline direct
 injection). This type of consistency is less
certain with systems relying on carburetors
and single-point injection, as fuel tends to
condense on the walls of the individual in-
take runners.

Engine speed
Higher engine speeds lead to greater friction
losses within the engine as well as increased
power consumption by auxiliary systems
(e.g., water pump). Under these conditions,
the power output per consumed unit of en-
ergy decreases. The engine’s operating effi-
ciency falls as engine speed rises. 

Generating a given level of power at high
engine speed equates with a higher level of
fuel consumption than producing the same
output at a lower engine speed. This leads 
to higher levels of pollutant emissions.

Exhaust emissions

Factors affecting untreated emissions

265

Engine load
The engine load or the generated engine
torque has different effects on the pollutant
components carbon monoxide (CO), un-
burnt hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrous
 oxides (NOX). The various influences are
 described in more detail below.

Moment of ignition
The ignition of the air/fuel mixture, i.e., 
the period of time between flashover and 
the formation of a stable flame front, is of
decisive significance to the combustion
 sequence. The character of the ignition
process is shaped by the timing of the
flashover, the ignition energy, and the
 composition of the mixture at spark plug. 
A large quantity of ignition energy translates
into stable ignition with positive effects,
both on the consistency of the consecutive
combustion cycles and the composition of
the exhaust gases.

Untreated HC emissions
The influence of torque
The temperature in the combustion cham-
ber rises as torque increases. The depth of
the zone in which the flame is extinguished
close to the combustion-chamber wall as a
result of low temperatures therefore shrinks
as torque rises. Fewer unburnt hydrocarbons
are then produced on account of more com-
plete combustion. 

In addition, the high exhaust-gas tempera-

tures that accompany higher combustion-
chamber temperatures under high-torque
operation promote secondary reactions in 
the unburned hydrocarbons during the ex-
pansion and push-out phases to produce CO2
and water. Because high-torque operation
equates with higher temperatures in combus-
tion chambers and exhaust gases, it leads to
reductions in quantities of unburnt hydro -
carbons relative to units of power generated.

The influence of the air/fuel ratio
The HC emissions from a gasoline engine
increase as engine speeds rises, because the
time available for preparing and combusting
the mixture becomes shorter. 

The influence of the air/fuel ratio
During operation with an air deficiency 
(λ < 1), incomplete combustion leads to 
the formation of unburnt hydrocarbons.
Richer mixtures produce progressively
greater HC concentrations (Fig. 1). In the
rich range, therefore, HC emissions increase
as the excess-air factor λ decreases.

HC emissions also increase in the lean
range (λ > 1). Minimum HC generation co-
incides with the range λ = 1.1...1.2. The rise
within the lean range is caused by incom-
plete combustion at the extremities of the
combustion chamber. Extremely lean mix-
tures, where combustion lag can ultimately
lead to ignition miss, aggravate this effect
and produce a dramatic rise in HC emis-
sions. This phenomenon is caused by un-
equal mixture distribution in the combus-
tion chamber and thus poor ignition condi-
tions in lean combustion-chamber zones. 

266

Exhaust emissions

Factors affecting untreated emissions

The gasoline-engine’s lean-burn limit is pri-
marily dependent on the excess-air factor 
at the spark plug at the instant of ignition,
and by the composite excess-air factor
(air/fuel ration considered over the entire
combustion chamber). The flow pattern of
the charge in the combustion chamber can
be manipulated to obtain a more homoge-
neous mixture to ensure more reliable igni-
tion, while at the same time accelerating
propagation of the flame front.

The stratified-charge method used in
 conjunction with gasoline direct injection
presents a contrasting picture. Instead of
 focusing on obtaining a homogeneous
air/fuel mixture throughout the combustion
chamber, this concept creates a highly ig-
nitable mixture only in the area immediately
adjacent to the tip of the spark plug. This
concept thus allows substantially higher
composite excess-air factors than would be
available using a homogeneous mixture. 
HC emissions in stratified-charge mode 
are essentially determined by the mixture
formation process. 

It is vital in the case of direct injection
wherever possible to avoid depositing liquid
fuel on the combustion-chamber walls and
the piston, as the resulting wall-applied film
usually fails to combust completely, leading
to high HC emissions.

The influence of the moment of ignition
Increasing the ignition advance (high αZ)
produces a rise in emissions of unburnt
 hydrocarbons, as the resulting reduction in
exhaust-gas temperature has a negative ef-
fect on secondary reactions in the expansion
and exhaust phases (Fig. 1). It is only during
operation with extremely lean mixtures that
this response pattern is inverted. These types
of lean mixtures result in such a low flame-
front propagation rate that the combustion
process will still be in progress when the ex-
haust valve opens if ignition is late. With late
ignition, the engine reaches its lean-burn
limit early, at an excess-air factor of λ.

Untreated CO emissions
The influence of torque
As with untreated HC emissions, the higher
process temperatures that accompany high
torque foster secondary reactions in CO
during the expansion phase. The CO oxi-
dizes to form CO2.

The influence of engine speed
CO emissions also mirror the pattern of 
HC emissions in their response to variations
in engine speed. 

The influence of the air/fuel ratio
In the rich range, CO emissions display a
virtually linear correlation with the excess-
air factor (Fig. 2). This is the result of the
 incomplete carbon oxidation during
 operation with an air deficiency. 

In the lean range (excess surplus), 
CO emissions remain at extremely low
 levels, and the influence of changes in the
excess-air factor is minimal. Under these
conditions, the only source of CO genera-
tion is incomplete combustion of a poorly
 homogenized air/fuel mixture.

Factors affecting untreated emissions

267

The influence of the moment of ignition
The moment of ignition has virtually no in-
fluence on CO emissions (Fig. 2), which are
almost entirely a function of the excess-air
factor λ.

Untreated NOX emissions
The influence of torque
The higher combustion-chamber tempera-
tures that accompany increased torque gen-
eration promote the formation of NOX.  
As torque output rises, untreated NOX emis-
sions display a disproportionate increase. 

The influence of engine speed
As the response time available to form 
NOX is shorter at higher engine speeds, 
NOX emissions decrease as engine speed
 increases. In addition, the residual-gas con-
tent in the combustion chamber must be
considered since it causes lower peak tem-
peratures. Because this residual-gas content
tends to fall off as engine speed rises, this
 effect counteracts the response pattern
 described above.

The influence of the air/fuel ratio
The maximum level of NOX emissions 
lies with slight excess air in the range of 
λ = 1.05...1.1. In the lean and rich ranges,
NOX emissions drop, since the peak com-
bustion temperatures decrease. 

A characteristic of stratified-charge opera-
tion in engines with gasoline direct injection
is a high excess-air factor. The NOX emis-
sions are low when compared with the oper-
ating point at λ = 1, since only some of the
gas takes part in the combustion process. 

The influence of the moment of ignition
Throughout the range with excess-air factors
of λ, NOX emissions rise as ignition advance
is increased (Fig. 3). The higher combustion
temperatures promoted by earlier ignition
timing not only shift the chemical equilib-
rium toward greater NOX formation, but –
most significantly – they also accelerate the
speed at which this formation takes place.

Soot emissions
Gasoline engines produce only extremely
low soot emissions during operation on
mixtures in the vicinity of stoichiometric.
However, soot can be generated in engines
with gasoline direct injection during strati-
fied-charge operation, when its formation
can be fostered by localized areas with ex-
tremely rich mixtures or even fuel droplets.
To ensure that adequate time remains avail-
able for efficient mixture formation, opera-
tion in stratified-charge mode must there-
fore be restricted to low and moderate
 engine speeds.

Catalytic emission control

Overview

Catalytic emission control

Emission-control legislation lays down
 limits governing pollutant emissions from
motor vehicles. On-engine measures on
their own are not enough to comply with
these limits. In gasoline engines, catalytic
exhaust-gas aftertreatment for the purpose
of converting the pollutants has now taken
center stage. To this end, the exhaust gas
passes through one or more catalytic con-
verters located in the exhaust-system
branch before being discharged to atmo -
sphere. The pollutants contained in the
 exhaust gas are converted on the surface 
of the catalytic converter(s) by chemical
 reactions into non-toxic substances. 

Overview 

(λ = 1), a three-way catalytic converter at
normal operating temperature is able to
convert the following pollutants virtually
completely: carbon monoxide (CO), hydro-
carbons (HCs) and nitrous oxides (NOX).
However, adhering exacting to a figure of 
λ = 1 requires mixture formation by means
of electronically controlled gasoline injec-
tion; today, this system has completely
 replaced the carburetor, which was used
 primarily up until the introduction of the
three-way catalytic converter. Precise lambda
closed-loop control monitors the composi-
tion of the air/fuel mixture and regulates it
at a value of λ = 1. Although these ideal con-
ditions cannot always be maintained in all
operating states, pollutant emissions can 
on average be reduced by more than 98 %.

Catalytic exhaust-gas aftertreatment with
the aid of a three-way catalytic converter is
currently the most effective form of emis-
sion control for gasoline engines. The three-
way catalytic converter is an integral compo-
nent of the exhaust-emission control sys-
tems of both manifold-injection engines and
gasoline direct-injection engines (Fig. 1). 

In the case of homogeneous mixture dis-
tribution with a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio

Because the three-way catalytic converter is
unable to convert the nitrous oxides in lean
mode (λ > 1), an additional NOX accumula-
tor-type catalytic converter is used in en-
gines with a lean operating mode. Another
means of reducing NOX at λ > 1 is Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR). This process is
 already being used in diesel commercial ve-
hicles, and development plans are currently
underway to introduce it in diesel passenger

cars. At this moment, however, it is not pos-
sible to foresee whether SCR will also be able
to be used in gasoline engines. 

The oxidation catalytic converter, which 
is used in diesel engines to oxidize HCs and
CO, is not used separately in gasoline en-
gines, since the three-way catalytic converter
performs its function. 

Development objectives
In view of the constantly tightening emis-
sion limits, reducing pollutant emissions
 remains an important objective in engine
design and development. Whereas a catalytic
converter which has reached normal operat-
ing temperature achieves very high conver-
sion rates bordering on 100 %, considerably
larger amounts of pollutants are emitted in
the cold-start and warm-up phases: The ac-
tual amounts of pollutants emitted during
the starting process and the subsequent
post-start phase can make up to 90 % of the
total emissions both in the European and
American test cycles (NEDC or FTP 75). 
In order to reduce emissions, it is therefore
essential both to ensure that the catalytic
converter heats up quickly and to generate
the fewest possible untreated emissions in
the starting phase and while the catalyst is
heating up. Early operational readiness on
the part of the lambda oxygen sensor is also
an important factor.

Catalytic-converter concepts 
Catalytic converters can be divided into the
following categories:
(cid:2) Continuously operating catalysts, and
(cid:2) Intermittently operating catalysts

Intermittently operating catalytic converters
operate in different phases, which are initi-
ated in each case by an active change in the
boundary conditions by the catalytic-con-
verter system. The NOX accumulator-type
catalytic converter operates intermittently:
In the event of excess oxygen in the exhaust
gas, NOX is accumulated and the system is
switched to rich mode (oxygen deficiency)
for the subsequent regeneration phase.

Three-way catalytic converter

Method of operation
The three-way catalytic converter converts
the following pollutant components into
non-toxic components during the combus-
tion of the air/fuel mixture: hydrocarbons
(HCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous
oxides (NOX). The end products which re-
sult are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide
(CO2) and nitrogen (N2).

Conversion of pollutants
The conversion of pollutants can be divided
into oxidation and reduction reactions. 
For example, oxidation of carbon monoxide
and hydrocarbons takes place according to
the following equations: 

2 CO + O2

(cid:2) 2 CO2

(eq. 1)

2 C2H6 + 7 O2

(cid:2) 4 CO2 + 6 H2O (eq. 2)

Reduction of nitrous oxides takes place
 according to the following exemplary
 equations: 

Continuously operating catalytic converters
convert pollutants uninterrupted and with-
out actively intervening in the engine oper-
ating conditions. The following systems 
are classed as continuously operating: the
three-way catalytic converter, the oxidation
catalytic converter and the SCR catalytic
converter (Selective Catalytic Reduction;
 currently used in diesel engines only). 

2 NO + 2 CO  (cid:2) N2 + 2 CO2

(eq. 3)

2 NO2 + 2 CO (cid:2) N2 + 2 CO2 + O2 (eq. 4)

The oxygen needed to oxidize HCs and CO
is drawn either directly from the exhaust gas
or from the nitrous oxides present in the ex-
haust gas, depending on the composition of
the air/fuel mixture. 

270

Catalytic emission control

Three-way catalytic converter

At λ = 1, a state of balance arises between the
oxidation and reduction reactions. The resid-
ual-oxygen content in the exhaust gas at λ = 1
(approximately 0.5 %) and the oxygen bound
in the nitrous oxide enable HCs and CO to
oxidize completely; the nitrous oxides are si-
multaneously reduced. Thus, HCs and CO
acts as reducing agents for the nitrous oxides.
The catalytic converter can compensate for
minor mixture fluctuations itself. 
It has the ability to accumulate and release
oxygen. Its substrate layer contains ceroxide,
which can make oxygen available via the
 following balance reaction: 

2 Ce2O3 + O2

(cid:3)(cid:2) 4 CeO2

(eq. 5)

In the event of constant excess oxygen
(λ > 1), HCs and CO are oxidized by the 
oxygen present in the exhaust gas. They are
therefore not available for the reduction of
the nitrous oxides. The raw NOX emissions
are therefore released untreated. In the event
of a constant oxygen deficiency (λ < 1), the
nitrous-oxide reduction reactions takes place
with HCs and CO as the reducing agents. 
Excess hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide
which cannot be converted for lack of oxygen
are released untreated. 

Conversion rate
The quantity of released pollutants is derived
from the concentration of the pollutants in
the untreated exhaust gas (Fig. 2a) and from
the conversion rate, i.e., from the proportion
that can be converted in the  catalytic con-
verter. Both variables are  dependent on the
set excess-air factor λ.

The highest possible conversion rate for all
three pollutant components requires a mix-
ture composition in the stoichiometric ratio
of λ = 1.0. The window (lambda control
range) in which the air/fuel ratio λ must 
be situated is therefore very small. Mixture
formation must therefore be followed up 
in a lambda closed-loop control circuit. 

The conversion rates for HCs and CO rise
continuously as the excess-air factor in-
creases, i.e., the emissions decrease (Fig. 2b).
At λ = 1, there is only a very low level of pol-
lutant components in the untreated exhaust
gas. With high excess-air factors (λ > 1), the
concentration of these pollutant components
remains at this low level. 

Conversion of the nitrous oxides (NOX) is
good in the rich range (λ < 1). Even a small
increase in the oxygen content in the exhaust
gas from λ = 1 impedes the reduction of 
nitrous oxides and causes a sharp increase 
in their concentration.

0.03...0.05 mm thick which is wound and sol-
dered in a high-temperature process. Thanks
to the thin walls, it is possible to  incorporate 
a greater number of passages per surface. 
This reduces the resistance ex perienced by 
the exhaust gas and brings  advantages in the
optimization of high- performance engines. 

Coating
Ceramic and metallic monoliths require a
substrate coating (washcoat) of aluminum
oxide (Al2O3). This coating increases the
 effective surface of the catalytic converter by 
a factor of 7000. 1 l catalyst volume therefore
has an area equating to a soccer field. 

The effective catalytic coating contains 
the noble metals platinum and/or palladium
and rhodium. Platinum and palladium accel-
erate the oxidation of hydrocarbons and of
carbon monoxide. Rhodium accelerates the
reduction of nitrous oxides (NOX). 

The amount of noble metal contained 
in a catalytic converter is roughly 1...5 g. 
This figure depends among other things 
on the engine displacement and on the
 exhaust-emission standard to be complied
with. 

Design
The catalytic converter (Fig. 3) essentially
comprises a sheet-steel housing (6), a substrate
(5), a substrate coating (washcoat), and the 
active catalytic noble-metal coating (4). 

Substrates
Two substrate systems have come to the fore-
front:

Ceramic monoliths
These ceramic monoliths are ceramic bodies
containing thousands of narrow passages
through which the exhaust gas flows. The 
ceramic is a high-temperature-resistant mag-
nesium-aluminum silicate. The monolith,
which is highly sensitive to mechanical ten-
sion, is fastened inside a sheet-steel housing
by means of mineral swell matting (2) which
expands the first time it is heated up and
firmly fixes the monolith in position. 
At the same time, the matting also ensures 
a 100 % gas seal. Ceramic monoliths are at
present the most commonly used catalyst
substrates. 

Metallic monoliths
The metallic monolith is an alternative to 
the ceramic monolith. It is made of finely
corrugated, thin metal foil approximately

Three-way catalytic converter, NOX accumulator-type catalytic converter

Operating conditions
Operating temperature
To enable the oxidation and reduction reac-
tions for converting the pollutants to pass
off, the reacting agents must be supplied
with a specific amount of activation energy.
This energy is provided by the heat from the
heated-up catalytic converter. 

The catalytic converter reduces the activa-

tion energy (Fig. 4) such that the light-off
temperature (i.e., the temperature at which
50 % of the pollutants is converted) drops.
The activation energy – and thus the light-
off temperature – are greatly dependent on
the respective reacting agents. Considering a
three-way catalytic converter, no worthwhile
conversion of pollutants takes place until 
the operating temperature exceeds 300 °C.
Operation within a temperature range of
400...800 °C is ideal for high conversion
 levels and a long service life. 

In the range of 800...1000 °C, thermal aging
of the catalytic converter is significantly im-
proved by sintering the noble metals and the
Al2O3 substrate coat. This leads to a reduc-
tion of the active surface. The operating
time in this temperature range also has a
 significant influence here. At temperatures
in excess of 1000 °C, thermal aging of the
catalytic converter increases sharply, causing
the catalyst to be largely ineffective.

Progress of reaction

In the event of engine malfunction (e.g., ig-
nition miss), the temperature in the catalytic
converter can rise to up to 1400 °C if un-
burnt fuel ignites in the exhaust-system
branch. Since such temperatures melt the
substrate and completely destroy the cata-
lyst, it is imperative that the ignition system
be highly reliable so as to prevent this from
occurring. Modern engine-management
 systems are able to detect ignition and com-
bustion miss, and in such cases interrupt 
the fuel injection to the cylinder concerned
so that unburnt mixture cannot enter the
exhaust-system branch.

Catalytic-converter poisoning
In order to be able to use a three-way cat-
alytic converter, it is essential for the engine
to be run on unleaded fuel. Otherwise, 
lead compounds would be deposited in the
active catalyst coating or clog the pores and
thereby reduce their number. 

Residues from the engine oil can also
“poison” the catalyst, i.e., damage it so far
that it becomes ineffective.

NOX accumulator-type
 catalytic converter

Function
During lean-burn operation, it is impossible
for the three-way catalytic converter to con-
vert the nitrous oxides (NOX) which have
been generated during combustion. CO and
HCs are oxidized by the high residual-oxy-
gen content in the exhaust gas and are there-
fore no longer available as reducing agents
for the nitrous oxides. The NOX accumula-
tor-type catalytic converter (NSC, NOX Stor-
age Catalyst) converts the nitrous oxides in 
a different way.

Design and special coating
The NOX accumulator-type catalytic con-
verter is similar in design to the conven-
tional three-way converter. In addition to
the platinum, palladium and rhodium coat-
ings, the NOX converter is provided with

special additives which are capable of accu-
mulating nitrous oxides. Typical accumulator
materials contain, for example, the oxides of
potassium, calcium, strontium,  zirconium,
lanthanum, or barium.

Method of operation
At λ = 1, due to the noble-metal coating, 
the NOX converter operates the same as 
a three-way converter. It also converts the
non-reduced nitrous oxides in lean exhaust
gases. However, conversion is not a continu-
ous process as it is with the hydrocarbons and
the carbon monoxide, but instead takes place
in three distinct phases:

1. NOX accumulation (storage)
2. NOX removal 
3. Conversion

NOX accumulation (storage)
In lean-burn engine operation (λ > 1), 
the nitrous oxides (NOX) are catalytically oxi-
dized on the surface of the platinum coating
to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Then the
NO2 reacts with the special oxides on the cat-
alyst surface and with oxygen (O2) to form
nitrates. Thus, for instance, NO2 combines
chemically with barium oxide (BaO) to form
the chemical compound  barium nitrate
Ba(NO3)2:

2 BaO + 4 NO2 + O2

(cid:2) 2 Ba(NO3)2

This enables the NOX converter to accumu-
late the nitrous oxides which have been
 generated during engine operation with
 excess air. 

There are two methods in use to determine
when the NOX converter is saturated and the
accumulation phase has finished: 
(cid:2) The model-supported process calculates
the quantity of stored NOX taking into
 account the catalyst temperature

(cid:2) An NOX sensor (Fig. 5, Pos. 6) downstream
of the NOX converter measures the NOX
concentration in the exhaust gas 

NOX removal and conversion
As the amount of stored nitrous oxides
(charge) increases, so the ability to continue
to bind nitrous oxides decreases. This means
that regeneration must take place as soon as a
given level is exceeded, i.e., the accumulated
nitrous oxides must be removed and con-
verted. To this end, the engine is switched
briefly to rich homogeneous mode (λ < 0.8).
The processes for removing the NOX and
converting it into nitrogen and carbon diox-
ide take place separately from each other. H2,
HCs, and CO are used as  reducing agents. 
Reduction is slowest with HCs and most
rapid with H2. Removal takes place as follows,

with CO being used as the reducing agent in
the following description: The carbon
monoxide reduces the nitrate (e.g., barium
nitrate Ba(NO3)2) to an oxide (e.g., barium
oxide BaO).  Carbon dioxide and nitrogen
monoxide are produced in the process:

Ba(NO3)2 + 3 CO  (cid:2) 3 CO2 + BaO + 2 NO

Subsequently, using carbon monoxide, the
rhodium coating reduces the nitrous oxides
to nitrogen and carbon dioxide:

2 NO + 2 CO

(cid:2) N2 + 2 CO2

There are two different methods of detecting
when the removal phase is complete.
(cid:2) The model-supported process calculates
the quantity of NOX still held by the 
NOX converter.

(cid:2) A lambda sensor (6) downstream of the

converter measures the oxygen concentra-
tion in the exhaust gas and outputs a
 voltage jump from “lean” to “rich” when 
removal has finished.

Operating temperature and 
installation point
The NOX converter’s ability to accu mulate/
store NOX is highly dependent on tempera-
ture. Accumulation reaches its maxi mum in
the range of 300...400 °C, which means that
the favorable temperature range is much
lower than that of the three-way catalytic
converter. For this reason and because of the
lower maximum permissible operating tem-
perature of the NOX converter, two separate
catalytic converters must be installed for 
catalytic emission control: 
an upstream three-way catalyst as the pri-
mary converter (Fig. 5, Pos. 3) and a down-
stream NOX accumulator-type catalyst (5) as
the main converter (underfloor converter).

Sulfur loading
The sulfur contained in gasoline presents 
the accumulator-type catalytic converter 
with a problem. The sulfur contained in lean
exhaust gas reacts with the barium oxide 
(accumulator material) to form barium sul-
fate. The result is that, over time, the amount
of accumulator material available for NOX
accumulation diminishes. Barium sulfate is
extremely resistant to high temperatures, and
for this reason is only degraded to a slight 
degree during NOX regeneration. 

When sour fuels (i.e., containing sulfur) 
are used, the catalytic converter must be con-
stantly desulfurized. For this purpose, the
converter is heated by specific heating mea-
sures to 600...650 °C and then exposed for a
few minutes to alternately rich (λ = 0.95) and
lean (λ = 1.05) exhaust gas. The barium sul-
fate reduces to barium oxide as a result.

Catalytic-converter
 configurations

Boundary conditions
The design of the exhaust system is defined
by various boundary conditions: heat-up per-
formance during cold starting, temperature
loading at full load, space situation in the ve-
hicle, and engine torque and power develop-
ment. 

The required operating temperature of the
three-way catalytic converter limits the instal-
lation options. Upstream converters quickly
reach operating temperature in the post-start
phase, but can be exposed to extremely high
thermal load at high engine load and speed.
Downstream converters 
are less exposed to these temperature loads.
But they do require more time in the heating-
up phase to reach operating temperature, if
this is not accelerated by an optimized strat-
egy for heating the converter (e.g., secondary-
air injection). 

Catalytic emission control

Catalytic-converter configurations

275

Strict emission-control regulations call for
special concepts for heating the catalytic con-
verter when the engine is started. The lower
the heat flow which can be generated to heat
the catalytic converter, and the lower the
emission limits, the closer the converter
should be installed to the engine – provided
no additional measures for improving heat-
ing-up performance are taken. Air-gap-
 insulated manifolds are often used; these
demonstrate lower heat losses up to the
 converter and thus have available a greater
quantity of heat for heating the converter.

Primary and main catalytic converters
A widely used configuration of the three-way
catalytic converter is the split arrangement
with an upstream primary catalyst and an un-
derfloor catalyst (main catalytic converter).
Upstream catalytic converters (i.e., near the
engine) require their coating to be optimized
to provide for high-temperature stability. 
Underfloor converters, on the other hand, re-
quire optimization in the so-called “low light-
off ” direction (low start-up temperature) and
good NOX conversion characteristics. For
faster heating and pollutant conversion, the
primary catalyst is usually smaller and has a
higher cell density and a greater noble-metal
load. 

Owing to their lower maximum permissi-
ble operating temperature, NOX accumula-
tor-type catalysts are always installed in the
underfloor area. 

As an alternative to the classic arrangement 
of splitting into two separate housings and
installation positions, there are also two-stage
catalytic-converter configurations  (cascade
catalytic converters), in which two catalyst
substrates are accommodated in a common
housing one after the other. The two sub-
strates are separated from each other for ther-
mal-isolation purposes by a small air gap. In a
cascade catalytic converter, the thermal load
of the second catalyst is, because of the spatial
proximity, comparable with the first catalyst.
Nevertheless, this arrangement permits inde-
pendent optimization of the two catalysts

with regard to noble-metal load, cell density
and wall thickness. The first catalyst general
has a larger noble-metal load and a higher
cell density for good light-off performance
during cold starting. A lambda sensor can 
be  installed between the two substrates for
 controlling and monitoring exhaust-gas treat-
ment.

Even concepts with only one overall catalytic
converter are used. It is possible with modern
coating methods to create different noble-
metal loads in the front and rear sections of
the catalyst. This configuration has a smaller
scope for design possibilities but is attractive
in cost terms. Provided there is enough space
available, the catalyst is  located as close to the
engine as possible. However, it can also be 
situated further away from the engine (i.e.,
downstream  positioning) if an effective cata-
lyst-heating process is used.

Multiflow configurations
The exhaust-system branches of the individ-
ual cylinders are brought together ahead of
the catalyst at least partially by the exhaust
manifold. Four-cylinder engines frequently
use exhaust manifolds which bring together
all four cylinders after a short distance. 
This makes it possible to use an upstream 
catalyst, which can be favorably positioned
for heating performance (Fig. 6a). 

For optimized-power engine configurations,
4-into-2 exhaust manifolds are the preferred
choice in four-cylinder engines; in this
arrangement, only two exhaust-gas branches
are brought together in each case. Positioning
one catalyst after the second junction into a
single overall exhaust-gas branch is not good
for the heating performance. 
For this reason, the ideal solution is to install
two upstream (primary) catalysts already
 after the first junction and if necessary a
 further (main) catalyst after the second join
(Fig. 6b).

A similar situation arises in engines with
more than four cylinders, especially in en-
gines with more than one cylinder bank 
(V-engine). Primary and main catalysts can
be used on each bank in accordance with the
above descriptions. Two different arrange-
ments may be used: The exhaust system is
completely designed as a dual-flow arrange-
ment (Fig. 6c), or a Y-shaped junction merg-
ing into an overall exhaust-gas branch is
used. In the latter case, a joint main catalyst
serving both cylinder banks can be used in 
a configuration with primary and main
 catalysts (Fig. 6d).

Catalytic-converter heating

The three-way catalytic converter must reach
a minimum temperature of roughly 300 °C
(light-off) before pollutants can be converted;
this temperature threshold can be even higher
on older catalysts. With the engine and ex-
haust system initially cold, the catalytic con-
verter must be heated up as quickly as possi-
ble to operating temperature. This requires a
short-term supply of heat, which can be pro-
vided by a variety concepts. 

Purely on-engine measures
To ensure effective catalyst heating with on-
engine measures, it is necessary to increase
both the exhaust-gas temperature and the ex-
haust-gas mass flow. This is achieved  using 
a variety of measures, which reduce engine
efficiency and therefore create an  increased
exhaust-gas heat flow. 

The heat-flow demand on the engine is 
dependent on the catalyst position and the
layout of the exhaust system, because the
 exhaust gas cools on its way to the catalyst
when the exhaust system is cold. 

Ignition timing
The main measure for increasing the exhaust-
gas heat flow is ignition-timing retardation.
Combustion is initiated as late as possible and
takes place during the expansion phase. The
exhaust gas has a relatively high temperature
at the end of the expansion phase.

Retarded combustion has an unfavorable

effect on engine efficiency.

Idle speed
A supporting measure is to raise the idle
speed and thereby increase the exhaust-gas
mass flow. The increased engine speed per-
mits a greater ignition-timing retardation;
however, in order to ensure reliable ignition,
the ignition angles are limited to roughly 
10° to 15° after TDC. The heat output limited
in this way is not always enough to achieve
the current emission limits.

Exhaust-camshaft adjustment
A further contribution to increasing the heat
flow can be achieved if necessary with ex-
haust-camshaft adjustment. The process of
the exhaust valves opening as early as possible
interrupts the retarded combustion early and
the mechanical work generated is thus re-
duced further. The corresponding quantity 
of energy is available as a quantity of heat in
the exhaust gas.

Stratified-charge/catalyst heating and
 homogeneous split
In the case of gasoline direct injection, there
are further processes which can quickly heat
the catalyst to operating temperature without
the need for additional components. 
In the “stratified-charge/catalyst heating” op-
erating mode, during stratified-charge opera-
tion with high levels of excess air a  further in-
jection of fuel takes place at the end of com-
bustion. This fuel burns partly in the exhaust
manifold first and delivers an additional in-
jection of heat to the catalyst. The “homoge-
neous-split” measure involves initially creat-
ing a homogeneous, lean basic mixture. A
subsequent stratified-charge injection facili-
tates retarded moments of ignition and re-
sults in high exhaust-gas heat flows. These
measures render the process of secondary-air
injection unnecessary in engines with gaso-
line direct injection.

Secondary-air injection
Thermal afterburning of unburnt fuel con-
stituents increases the temperature in the
 exhaust system. A rich (λ = 0.9) extending up
to a very rich (λ = 0.6) basic mixture is set for
this purpose. A secondary-air pump supplies
oxygen to the exhaust system to produce a
leaner exhaust-gas composition. 

Where the basic mixture is very rich 
(λ = 0.6), the unburnt fuel constituents oxi-
dize above a specific temperature threshold.
To achieve this temperature, it is necessary on
the one hand to raise the temperature level
with retarded ignition angles and on the
other hand to introduce the secondary air as
closely as possible to the exhaust valves. The
exothermic reaction in the exhaust system in-
creases the heat flow to the catalyst and there-
fore shortens the heating period. Further-
more, by comparison with purely on-engine
measures, HC and CO emissions are reduced
before entering the catalyst. 

Where the basic mixture is less rich 
(λ = 0.9), there is no significant reaction
ahead of the catalyst. The unburnt fuel con-
stituents oxidize in the catalyst and heat it up
from the inside. For this purpose, however,
the end face of the catalyst must first be
brought up to a level above the light-off tem-
perature by means of conventional measures
(such as ignition-timing retardation).

Catalytic emission control

Catalytic-converter heating

In reality, it is always a combination of these
two extreme cases that occurs. Figure 7 shows
by way of example the curves for HC and CO
emissions downstream of the catalyst in the
first few seconds of an emission test (FTP 75),
with and without secondary-air injection. 
Secondary-air injection is performed 
with an electric secondary-air pump (Fig. 8,
Pos. 1), which is switched by means of a  relay
(3) on account of the high power demand.
Since the secondary-air valve (5)  prevents
backflow of exhaust gases into the pump, it
must remain closed when the pump is deacti-
vated. Either it is a passive non-return valve
or it is actuated by purely electrical or (as
shown here) pneumatic means with an elec-
trically actuated control valve (6). When the
control valve is actuated, the secondary-air
valve opens in response to the intake-mani-
fold vacuum. The secondary-air system is 
coordinated by the  engine ECU (4).

Concepts for active heating 
Measures for active catalytic-converter heating
are processes which do not use the internal-
combustion engine as the heat source or which
do not use the engine as the sole heat source.
The advantage of such processes lies in the fact
that the heat can be supplied locally and does
not have to pass through the exhaust system 
to the catalyst. Unlike conventional heating
strategies with upstream catalysts, these con-
cepts have failed to catch on.

Electrically heated catalytic converter
In the case of an electrically heated catalyst,
the exhaust gas first flows through an approx-
imately 20 mm thick catalytic substrate plate
which can be heated with an electrical output
of roughly 2 kW. A secondary-air  system can
be used to provide assistance. The additional
exothermic effect (heat release) during the
conversion of the exhaust-gas/secondary-air
mixture in the heated plate accelerates the
heating process further. 

When compared with the heat currents of 
up to 20 kW which can be achieved with on-
engine measures if necessary in conjunction
with secondary-air injection, an electrical
output of 2 kW seems relatively low. However,
it is the temperature of the catalyst  substrate
and not the temperature of the  exhaust gas
which is crucial to catalyst operation. Direct
electrical heating of substrate is highly effec-
tive and results in very good emission values. 

In a conventional passenger car with a 12 V
supply voltage, the high currents that occur
for heating the catalyst place a significant
strain on the car’s electrical system. An ampli-
fied alternator and if necessary a second bat-
tery are therefore required. This system is bet-
ter suited for use in electric hybrid vehicles,
which have more powerful electrical systems
anyway.

The electrically heated catalytic converter
has previously been used in individual small-
scale production projects.

Burner system
Another concept for locally heating the
 catalytic converter is a fuel-powered burner,
the hot combustion exhaust gases of which
are fed upstream of the catalyst to the engine
exhaust system (Fig. 9). The burner system 
is supplied with air along the same lines as 
a secondary-air system and has its own

Catalysis

In order for chemical reactions to take place,
bonds in the starting substances must be re-
laxed and then split. This requires a minimum
amount of energy (activation energy) which
must be supplied to the starting substances,
for example in the form of heat. Many thermo-
dynamically possible reactions do not take
place at noticeable speed, since the activation
energy is very high, and this energy barrier
therefore is only overcome by a very small
number of molecules. 

A catalytic converter accelerates the reac-
tion in two ways. Firstly, it reduces the activa-
tion energy of the reaction so that this energy
barrier can be overcome by a greater number
of molecules. Secondly, the adsorption of the
reacting agents on the catalytic converter
 reduces the distance between them, and the
probability that the reacting agents will inter-
act with each other is thereby increased.

 ignition device and fuel-metering facility. In
order to achieve low emission targets, good
fuel atomization and mixture formation in
the burner are crucial to low burner emis-
sions, especially during starting. 

Heating-output figures of 15 kW can be
achieved with the burner system; however, in
contrast to the electrically heated catalyst, the
substrate is indirectly heated here. 

Mixing the gas flows of the engine and
burner (which differ greatly in temperature)
can be problematic. However, as well as local
heating, the burner system offers a further
advantage: Unburnt constituents of the en-
gine exhaust gas oxidize in the hot burner 
exhaust gas before entering the catalyst, 
and this results initially in a purely thermal
reduction of the pollutants. 

The burner system has only previously
been used in prototypes and has not been
used at all in volume-scale production.

There are different mechanisms for the
 reaction on the catalytic-converter surface; 
for instance, the oxidation of CO on the plat-
inum catalyst takes place according to the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, whereby
both reacting agents (CO and O2) are ad-
sorbed on the catalyst surface. The bonds
within the O2 molecule are relaxed and the
 reactivity of the CO increases. Finally, the O2
breaks down into atomic oxygen, which can
now react with the adsorbed CO. The CO2
created in this way is then desorbed again
into the gaseous phase.

Catalytic emission control

Lambda control loop

Lambda control loop

Function
In order that the conversion rates of the
three-way catalytic converter are as high as
possible for the pollutant components HC,
CO and NOX, the reaction components
must be present in the stoichiometric ratio.
This requires a mixture composition of 
λ = 1.0, i.e., the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio
must be adhered to very precisely. Mixture
formation must therefore be followed up in
a control loop, because sufficient accuracy
cannot be achieved solely by controlling the
metering of the fuel.

Method of operation
When the lambda control loop is used,
 deviations from a specific air/fuel ratio can
be detected and corrected through the quan-
tity of fuel injected. The residual-oxygen
content in the exhaust gas, which is mea-
sured with lambda oxygen sensors, serves 
as the measure for the composition of the
air/fuel mixture. 

For the purpose of two-step control which
can only maintain a value of λ = 1, a two-
step lambda sensor (Fig. 10, Pos. 3a) is in-
corporated in the exhaust-gas branch up-
stream of the primary catalyst (4). However,
the use of a wide-band lambda sensor also
permits continuous lambda closed-loop
control to λ values which deviate from the
value 1. 

Greater accuracy is achieved by a two-sen-
sor control system in which a second lambda
sensor (3b) is located downstream of the
main catalyst (5). 

Two-step control 
Two-step lambda control maintains the
air/fuel mixture at λ = 1. A two-step lambda
sensor serving as a measuring sensor in the
exhaust pipe constantly provides informa-
tion on whether the mixture is richer or
leaner than λ = 1. A high sensor voltage
(e.g., 800 mV) indicates a rich mixture, 
while a low sensor voltage (e.g., 200 mV)
 indicates a leaner mixture.

Lambda control loop

281

On each transition from rich to lean and
lean to rich, the sensor output signal de -
monstrates a voltage jump, which is evalu-
ated by a control circuit. The manipulated
variable changes its control direction in re-
sponse to each voltage jump: The lambda
controller lengthens or shortens the time
that the fuel injector is activated and thereby
increases or reduces the injected fuel
 quantity. 

The manipulated variable (lengthening or
shortening factor of the injection duration)
is made up of a jump and a ramp (Fig. 11).
In other words, when there is a jump in the
sensor signal, the mixture is first altered im-
mediately by a specific amount (jump) in
order to bring about a mixture correction as
quickly as possible. Then the manipulated
variable follows an adaptation function
(ramp) until another sensor-signal voltage
jump occurs. The air/fuel mixture thus
 constantly changes its composition in a 
very narrow range around λ = 1. 

The typical shift of the oxygen zero cross-
ing (theoretically at λ = 1.0) and thus of the
lambda-sensor jump, conditioned by the
variation of the exhaust-gas composition,
can be compensated for by shaping the ma-
nipulated-variable curve asymmetrically
(rich/lean shift). The preferred option here
is to maintain the ramp value for the sensor

jump for a controlled dwell time tV after the
sensor jump (Fig. 11): During the shift to
“rich”, the manipulated variable remains 
for a dwell time tV in the rich position, even
though the sensor signal has already jumped
in the “rich” direction. Only after the dwell
time has elapsed do the jump and ramp
 follow the manipulated variable in the “lean”
direction. If the sensor signal then jumps in
the “lean” direction, the manipulated vari-
able is controlled in the directly opposite
 direction (with jump and ramp) without
 remaining in the lean position. 

During the shift to “lean”, the behavior is
reversed: If the sensor signal indicates a lean
mixture, the manipulated variable remains
for the dwell time tV in the lean position and
is only then controlled in the “rich” direc-
tion. On the other hand, countercontrol is
effected immediately when the sensor signal
jumps from “lean” to “rich”. 

Continuous-action lambda control
Continuous-action lambda control enables
the composition of the air/fuel mixture to 
be controlled to values which deviate from
the stoichiometric ratio. Thus, controlled
enrichment (λ < 1), e.g., to protect com -
ponents, and controlled leaning (λ > 1), 
e.g., for a leaner warm-up during catalyst
heating, can be effected.

Catalytic emission control

Lambda control loop

The wide-band lambda sensor outputs a
continuous voltage signal USa. This means
that not only the lambda range (rich or
lean) but also the amount of the deviation
from λ = 1 can be measured and directly
evaluated. In this way, lambda control can
react more quickly to a mixture deviation.
The increased dynamic response results in
an improved control response. 

It is also possible with the wide-band
lambda sensor (in contrast to control with a
two-step lambda sensor) to effect control to
mixture compositions which deviate from
the stoichiometric ratio (λ = 1). The mea-
surement range stretches to lambda values
in the field of λ = 0.7 up to “pure air”; the
range of active lambda control is limited,
 depending on the application. Continuous-
action lambda control is therefore suitable
for lean and rich operation.

Two-sensor control
When it is situated upstream of the catalyst,
the lambda sensor is heavily stressed by high
temperatures and untreated exhaust gas, and
this leads to limitations in lambda-control
accuracy. Locating a lambda sensor (Fig. 10,
Pos. 3b) downstream of the catalyst means
that these influences are considerably re-
duced. However, lambda control on its own
with the sensor downstream of the catalyst

demonstrates disadvantages in dynamic re-
sponse on account of the gas travel times,
and  responds to mixture changes more
slowly. 

Greater accuracy is achieved with two-
sensor control. Here, a slower correction
control loop is superimposed on the two-
step or continuous-action lambda control
described by means of an additional two-
step lambda sensor.

Lambda closed-loop control for 
gasoline  direct injection
Lambda closed-loop control for gasoline
 direct injection does not differ for homoge-
neous operation (λ = 1) from the control
strategies described above. Systems which
additionally support lean engine operation
(λ > 1) require control of the NOX accumu-
lator-type catalytic converter. The NOX ac-
cumulator-type catalyst has a dual function.
During lean-burn operation, NOX accumu-
lation and HC and CO oxidation must take
place. In addition, at λ = 1, a stable three-
way function is needed which provides for 
a minimum level of oxygen accumulation.
The lambda sensor upstream of the catalyst
monitors the stoichiometric composition of
the mixture.

In addition to contributing to two-sensor
control, the two-step sensor downstream 
of the NOX accumulator-type catalyst also
monitors the combined O2 and NOX accu-
mulation performance (detection of the 
end of the NOX removal phase).

Three-sensor control
In the interests of both catalytic-converter
diagnosis (separate monitoring of the pri-
mary and main catalysts) and exhaust-gas
constancy, the use of a third sensor down-
stream of the main catalyst is recommended
in SULEV vehicles (Super Ultra-Low-
 Emission Vehicle, a category defined in the
 Californian emission-control legislation)
(Fig. 12). The two-sensor control system
(single cascade) is expanded to include
 extremely slow control with the third 
sensor downstream of the main catalyst 
and thereby facilitates faster control with 
the second sensor. 

(cid:3)

Ozone and smog

Exposure to the sun’s radiation splits nitrogen-
dioxide molecules (NO2). The products are
 nitrogen oxide (NO) and atomic oxygen (O),
which combine with the ambient air’s mole -
cular oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3). Ozone
 formation is also promoted by volatile organic
compounds such as hydrocarbons. This is
why higher ozone levels must be anticipated
on hot, windless summer days when high
 levels of air pollution are present.

In naturally occurring concentrations, ozone

is essential for human life. However, in higher
concentrations it leads to coughing, irritation
of the throat and sinuses, and burning eyes. 
It adversely affects lung function, reducing
performance potential.

There is no direct contact or mutual move-
ment between the undesirable ozone formed
at ground level, and the stratospheric ozone

Individual-cylinder control
Above all with upstream primary catalysts, 
it is not possible to ensure that the exhaust
gases from the individual cylinders are suffi-
ciently mixed together before they pass
through the catalyst. The fact that exhaust
gas passes through the catalyst segments in
strands, depending on the deviation from 
λ = 1 of the cylinders, results in insufficient
conversion. Lambda coordination of the
 individual cylinders can bring about signifi-
cant reductions of exhaust emissions; this
process involves adjusting the cylinders indi-
vidually to λ = 1. Extremely high demands
must be place on the dynamic response of
the lambda sensor in order to obtain the
lambda values for the individual cylinders
from a measured lambda signal. 

that reduces the amount of ultraviolet radiation
from the sun.

Smog can be created in winter in response
to atmospheric layer inversions and low wind
speeds. The temperature inversion in the air
layers prevents the heavier, colder air contain-
ing the higher pollutant concentrations from
rising and dispersing.

Smog leads to irritation of the mucous
membranes, eyes, and respiratory system. 
It can also impair visibility. This last factor
 explains the origin of the term smog, which 
is a contraction of the words "smoke" and
"fog".

Emission-control legislation

Overview

Emission-control legislation

The US state of California has assumed a
 pioneering role in efforts to restrict by law
pollutant emissions emanating from motor
vehicles. The California legislature was
spurred into action not least due to the fact
that the city of Los Angeles is situated in 
a basin, preventing wind from dispersing
exhaust gases and causing a blanket of haze
to descend on and hang over the city. Given
the high levels of pollutants in the air, this
phenomenon led to the buildup of smog
and as a result caused health problems in
the city’s population and massive restric-
tions on visibility. 

Overview

California introduced the first emission-
control legislation for gasoline engines in
the mid-1960s. These regulations became
progressively more stringent in the ensuing
years. In the meantime, all industrialized
countries have introduced emission-control
laws which define limits for gasoline and
diesel engines, as well as the test procedures
employed to confirm compliance. In some
countries, regulations governing exhaust
emissions are supplemented by limits on
evaporative losses from the fuel system.

The most important legal restrictions on
 exhaust emissions are (Fig. 1):

Classifications 
Countries with legal limits on motor-vehicle
emissions divide vehicles into various classes:
(cid:2) Passenger cars: Emission testing is con-
ducted on a chassis dynamometer.
(cid:2) Light-duty trucks: The upper limit lies 
at a maximum permissible weight of be-
tween 3.5 and 6.35 metric tons, varying
according to country. Testing is carried
out on a chassis dynamometer (as with
passenger cars).

(cid:2) Heavy-duty trucks: Maximum permissible
weight in excess of 3.5...6.35 metric tons.
Testing is performed on an engine test
bench, with no provision for in-vehicle
testing.

(cid:2) Off-highway (e.g., construction, agricul-
tural, and forestry vehicles): Tested on 
an engine test bench, as for heavy-duty
trucks.

Test procedures 
Japan and the European Union have fol-
lowed the lead of the United States by defin-
ing test procedures for certifying compliance
with emission limits. These procedures have
been adopted in modified or unrevised form
by other countries. 

The mass of toxic emissions from each vehi-
cle is determined by operating it in confor-
mity with speed cycles precisely defined for
the test cycle. During the test cycle, the ex-
haust gases are collected for subsequent
analysis to determine the pollutant mass
emitted during the driving cycle. 

Legal requirements prescribe any of three

and test objective:

Certification

(cid:2) Random testing of vehicles from serial

 authorities (Conformity of Production)

(cid:2) In-field monitoring for testing certain

Type approval
Type approvals are a precondition for grant-
ing General Certification for an engine or
vehicle type. This process entails proving
compliance with stipulated emissions limits
in defined test cycles. Different countries
have defined individual test cycles and
 emission limits. 

Test cycles
Dynamic test cycles are specified for passen-
ger cars and light-duty trucks. The country-
specific differences between the two proce-
dures are rooted in their respective origins:
(cid:2) Test cycles designed to mirror conditions
recorded in actual highway operation, e.g.
Federal Test Procedure (FTP) test cycle in
the USA, and

(cid:2) Synthetically generated test cycles consist-
ing of phases at constant cruising speed
and acceleration rates, e.g., Modified 
New European Driving Cycle (MNEDC)
in  Europe

way), steady-state exhaust-gas tests (e.g. 
13-stage test in the EU), or dynamic tests
(e.g. Transient Cycle in the USA) are carried
out on the engine test bench. 

All the test cycles are depicted at the end of
this section.

Random testing 
This testing is usually conducted by the ve-
hicle manufacturer in the quality-control
checks that accompany the production
process. The same test procedures and limits
are generally applied as for type approval.
The authorities responsible for granting
 homologation approval can demand confir-
mation testing as often as deemed necessary.
EU regulations and ECE directives (Eco-
nomic Commission for Europe) take ac-
count of production tolerances by carrying
out random testing on a minimum of 3 to a
maximum of 32 vehicles. The most stringent
requirements are encountered in the USA,
and particularly in California, where the
 authorities require what is essentially com-
prehensive and total quality monitoring.

In-field monitoring
Random emission-control tests are con-
ducted in driving mode on vehicles whose
running performance and age are within
specific limits. The emission-control test
procedure is simplified compared with 
type approval.

Emission-control legislation

CARB legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

CARB legislation 
(passenger cars/LDTs)

CARB, or California Air Resources Board
emission limits for passenger cars and 
Light-Duty Trucks (LDTs) are defined in
standards specifying exhaust-gas emissions:
(cid:2) LEV I, and
(cid:2) LEV II (Low Emission Vehicle)

Emission limits
The CARB legislation defines limits on 
(cid:2) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:2) Nitrous oxides (NOX) 
(cid:2) Non-methane organic gases (NMOG)
(cid:2) Formaldehyde (LEV II only)
(cid:2) Particulate emissions (diesel engines: 
LEV I and LEV II; gasoline-engines: 
LEV II only)

Since model year 2004 the LEV II standard
has governed all new vehicles up to a maxi-
mum permissible weight of 14,000 lb 
(lb: pound; 1 lb = 0.454 kg).

Phase-in
Following introduction of the LEV II stan-
dard, at least 25 % of new vehicle registra-
tions must be certified to this standard. 
The phase-in rule stipulates that an addi-
tional 25 % of new vehicle registrations 
must then conform to the LEV II standard
in each consecutive year. As of 2007 all new
vehicle registrations must then be certified
according to the LEV II standard.

Actual emission levels are determined using
the FTP 75 driving cycle (Federal Test Pro-
cedure). Limits are defined in relation to
 distance and specified in grams per mile. 
Within the period 2001 through 2004 
the SFTP (Supplemental Federal Test Proce-
dure) standard was introduced together with
other test cycles. There are also further limits
that require compliance in addition to FTP
emission limits.

Emission categories
Automotive manufacturers are at liberty to
deploy a variety of vehicle concepts within
the permitted limits, providing they main-
tain a fleet average (see the section on “Fleet
averages”). The concepts are allocated to the
following exhaust-gas categories, depending
on their emission values for NMOG, CO,
NOX, and particulate emissions (Fig. 2):

(cid:2) SULEV (Super Ultra-Low-Emission

In addition to the categories of LEV I and

(cid:2) PZEV (Partial ZEV, which is basically
SULEV, but with more stringent limits

long-term performance criteria)

Since 2004 new vehicle registrations have
been governed by the LEV II exhaust-emis-
sion standard. At the same time, TLEV will
be replaced by SULEV with its substantially
lower limits. The LEV and ULEV classifica-
tions remain in place. The CO and NMOG

limits from LEV I remain unchanged, 
but the NOX limit is substantially lower for
LEV II. The LEV II standard also includes
new, supplementary limits governing
formaldehyde. 

Long-term compliance
To obtain approval for each vehicle model
(type approval), the manufacturer must
prove compliance with the official emission
limits for pollutants. Compliance means that
the limits may not be exceeded for the fol-
lowing mileages or periods of useful life: 
(cid:2) 50,000 miles or 5 years (“intermediate

useful life”), and

(cid:2) 100,000 miles (LEV I) / 120,000 miles
(LEV II) or 10 years (“full useful life”)

Manufacturers also have the option of certi-
fying vehicles for 150,000 miles using the
same limits that apply to 120,000 miles. 
The manufacturer then receives a bonus
when the NMOG fleet average is defined
(see the section entitled “Fleet averages”).
The relevant figures for the PZEV emis-

sion-limit category are 150,000 miles or 
15 years (“full useful life”). 

For this type of approval test, the manufac-
turer must furnish two vehicle fleets from
series production:
(cid:2) One fleet in which each vehicle must
cover 4000 miles before testing. 

(cid:2) One fleet for endurance testing, in which
deterioration factors for individual com-
ponents are defined. 

Endurance testing entails subjecting the
 vehicles to specific driving cycles over dis-
tances of 50,000 and 100,000/120,000 miles.
Exhaust emissions are tested at intervals 
of 5000 miles. Service inspections and
 maintenance are restricted to the standard
prescribed intervals.

Countries that base their regulations on
the US test cycles allow application of de-
fined deterioration factors to simplify the
certification process.

288

Emission-control legislation

CARB legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

The value for light-duty trucks is 20.7 miles
per gallon or 11.4 liters per 100 kilometers.
Between 2005 and 2007 “fuel economy” will
be raised each year by 0.6 mpg. There are no
regulations for heavy-duty trucks. 

At the end of each year the average fuel
economy for each manufacturer is calcu-
lated based on the numbers of vehicles sold.
The manufacturer must remit a penalty fee
of $5.50 per vehicle for each 0.1 mpg its fleet
exceeds the target. Buyers will also have to
pay a gas-guzzler tax on vehicles with espe-
cially high fuel consumption. Here, the limit
is 22.5 miles per gallon (corresponding to
10.45 liters per 100 kilometers). 

These penalties are intended to spur de-
velopment of vehicles offering greater fuel
economy.

The FTP 75 test cycle and the highway
 cycle are applied to measure fuel economy
(see the section entitled “US test cycles”).

Fleet averages (NMOG)
Each vehicle manufacturer must ensure that
exhaust emissions for its total vehicle fleet
do not exceed a specified average. NMOG
emissions serve as the reference category for
assessing compliance with these averages.
The fleet average is calculated from the aver-
age figures produced by all of the manufac-
turer’s vehicles that comply with NMOG
limits and are sold within one year. Different
fleet averages apply to passenger cars and
light-duty trucks and vans.

The compliance limits for the NMOG
fleet average are lowered in each subsequent
year (Fig. 4). To meet the lower limits,
 manufacturers must produce progressively
cleaner vehicles in the more stringent emis-
sions categories in each consecutive year. 
The fleet averages apply irrespective of

LEV I or LEV II standards.

Corporate average fuel economy
US legislation specifies the average amount
of fuel an automotive manufacturer’s vehicle
fleet may consume per mile. The prescribed
CAFE value (Corporate Average Fuel Econ-
omy) currently (2004) stands at 27.5 mpg
for passenger cars. This corresponds to 
8.55 liters per 100 kilometers in the metric
system. At the present time it is not planned
to reduce this limit.

Zero-emission vehicles
As from 2005 10 % of new vehicle registra-
tions will have to meet the requirements 
of the ZEV (Zero-Emission Vehicle) ex-
haust-gas category. These vehicles may emit
no exhaust gas or evaporative emissions in
operation. This category mainly refers to
electric cars. 

A 10 % percentage may partly be covered by
vehicles of the PZEV (Partial Zero-Emission
Vehicles) exhaust-gas category. These vehi-
cles are not zero-emission, but they emit
very few pollutants. They are weighted using
a factor of 0.2 to 1, depending on the emis-
sion-limit standard. The minimum weight-
ing factor of 0.2 is granted when the follow-
ing demands are met: 
(cid:2) SULEV certification indicating long-term
compliance extending over 150,000 miles
or 15 years

(cid:2) Warranty coverage extending over

150,000 miles or 15 years on all emission-
related components

(cid:2) No evaporative emissions from the fuel
system (0 EVAP, Zero Evaporation),
achieved by extensive encapsulation 
of the tank and fuel system

Special regulations apply to hybrid vehicles
combining diesel engines and electric mo-
tors. These vehicles can also contribute to
achieving compliance with the 10 % limit.

In-field monitoring
Unscheduled testing
Random emission testing is conducted on
in-use vehicles using the FTP 75 test cycle
and an evaporation test. Depending on the
relevant exhaust-gas category, vehicles with
mileage readings below 75,000/90,000/
105,000 miles are tested.

Vehicle monitoring by the manufacturer
Official reporting of claims and damage 
to specific emissions-related components
and systems has been mandatory for vehicle
manufacturers since model year 1990. 
The reporting obligation remains in force

for a maximum period of 15 years, or
150,000 miles, depending on the warranty
period applying to the component or
 assembly. 

Reporting is divided into three stages with

an incremental amount of detail:
(cid:2) Emissions Warranty Information Report

(EWIR)

(cid:2) Field Information Report (FIR), and
(cid:2) Emission Information Report (EIR)

Information concerning 
(cid:2) problem reports, 
(cid:2) malfunction statistics, 
(cid:2) defect analysis, and 
(cid:2) the effects on emissions 

is then forwarded to the environment-
 protection authorities. The authorities use
the FIR as the basis for issuing mandatory
recall orders to the manufacturer.

EPA legislation 
(passenger cars/LDTs)

EPA (Environment Protection Agency)
 legislation applies to all of the states where
the more stringent CARB stipulations from
California are not in force. CARB regula-
tions have already been adopted by some
states, such as Maine, Massachusetts, and
New York. 

EPA regulations in force since 2004

 conform to the Tier 2 standard. 

Emission limits
The EPA legislation defines limits on the
 following pollutants: 
(cid:2) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:2) Nitrous oxides (NOX) 
(cid:2) Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG) 
(cid:2) Formaldehyde (HCHO), and 
(cid:2) Solids (particulates) 

Pollutant emissions are determined using
the FTP 75 driving cycle. Limits are defined
in relation to distance and specified in
grams per mile.

290

Emission-control legislation

EPA legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

The SFTP (Supplemental Federal Test
 Procedure) standard, comprising further 
test cycles, has been in force since 2001. 
The applicable limits require compliance 
in addition to FTP emission limits. 

Since the introduction of Tier 2 standards,
vehicles with diesel and gasoline engines
have been subject to identical exhaust-
 emission limits.

Exhaust-gas categories
Tier 2 (Fig. 5) classifies limits for passenger
cars in 10 bins (emission standards) and 
11 bins for heavy-duty trucks. Bin 9 and 
Bin 10 in relation to passenger cars will be
dropped in 2007.

The transition to Tier 2 has produced the
following changes:
(cid:2) Introduction of fleet averages for NOX
(cid:2) Formaldehydes (HCHO) are subject to 

a separate pollutant category 

(cid:2) Passenger cars and light-duty trucks up to
6000 lb (2.72 t) are combined in a single
vehicle class

(cid:2) MDPV (Medium-Duty Passenger Vehi-
cle) forms a separate vehicle category;
previously assigned to HDV (Heavy-Duty
Vehicles) 

(cid:2) “Full useful life” is increased, depending

on the emission standard (bin), to
120,000 miles or 150,000 miles

Phase-in
At least 25 % of all new passenger-car and
LLDT (light LDTs) registrations are required
to conform to Tier 2 standards when they
take effect in 2004. The phase-in rule stipu-
lates that an additional 25 % of vehicles 
will then be required to conform to the
Tier 2 standards in each consecutive year. 
All vehicles are required to conform to 
Tier 2 standards by 2007. For the category
HLDT/MDPV, the phase-in period ends 
in 2009.

Fleet averages
NOX emissions are used to determine fleet
averages for individual manufacturers under
EPA legislation. CARB regulations, however,
are based on NMOG emissions.

Emission-control legislation

EPA legislation/EU legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

291

Corporate average fuel economy
The regulations defining average fleet fuel
consumption in the 49 states are the same as
those applied in California. Again, the limit
applicable to passenger cars is 27.5 miles 
per gallon (8.55 liters per 100 kilometers).
Beyond this figure manufacturers are re-
quired to pay a penalty. The purchaser also
pays a penalty tax on vehicles providing less
than 22.5 miles per gallon.

In-field monitoring
Unscheduled testing
In analogy to CARB legislation, the EPA
 regulations require random exhaust-gas
emission testing based on the FTP 75 test cy-
cles for in-use vehicles. Testing is conducted
on low-mileage (10,000 miles, roughly one
year old) and higher-mileage vehicles
(50,000 miles, in California however at least
one vehicle per test group with 75,000 or
90,000 or 105,000 miles, depending on the
emission standard; roughly four years old).
The number of vehicles tested varies accord-
ing to the number sold. At least one vehicle
in each group is also tested for evaporative
emissions.

Vehicle monitoring by the manufacturer
For vehicles after model year 1972, the
 manufacturer is obliged to make an official
report concerning damage to specific emis-
sion-related components or systems if at
least 25 identical emission-related parts in 
a model year are defective. The reporting
obligation ends five years after the end of the
model year. The report comprises a descrip-
tion of damage to the defective component,
presentation of the impacts on exhaust-gas
emissions, and suitable corrective action by
the manufacturer. The environmental au-
thorities use this information as the basis 
for determining whether to issue recall
 orders to the manufacturer.

EU legislation 
(passenger cars/LDTs)

The directives contained in European Union
emission-control legislation are defined by
the EU Commission. Emission-control legis-
lation for passenger cars/light-duty trucks is
Directive 70/220/EEC from 1970. For the
first time it defined exhaust-emission limits,
and the provisions have been updated ever
since.

The emission limits for passenger cars and
light-duty trucks (LDTs) are: 
(cid:2) Euro 1 (as from 1 July 1992) 
(cid:2) Euro 2 (as from 1 January 1996) 
(cid:2) Euro 3 (as from 1 January 2000) 
(cid:2) Euro 4 (as from 1 January 2005)

A new exhaust-emission standard is gener-
ally introduced in two stages. In the first
stage, compliance with the newly defined
emission limits is required in vehicle models
submitted for initial homologation approval
certification (TA, Type Approval). In the
second stage – usually one year later – every
new registration must comply with the new
limits (First Registration, FR). The authori-
ties can also inspect vehicles from series pro-
duction to verify compliance with emissions
limits (COP, Conformity of Production). 

EU directives allow tax incentives for ve-
hicles that comply with upcoming exhaust-
gas emission standards before they actually
become law. Depending on a vehicle’s emis-
sion standard, there are a number of differ-
ent motor-vehicle tax rates in Germany.

Emission limits
The EU standards define limits on the fol-
lowing pollutants:
(cid:2) Carbon monoxide (CO)
(cid:2) Hydrocarbons (HCs) 
(cid:2) Nitrous oxides (NOX)
(cid:2) Particulates, although these limits are
 initially restricted to diesel vehicles

292

Emission-control legislation

EU legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

The limits for hydrocarbons and nitrogen ox-
ides for the Euro 1 and Euro 2 stages are com-
bined into an aggregate value (HC+NOX).
Since Euro 3, there has been a special restric-
tion for NOX emissions in addition to the ag-
gregate value. The limits are defined based on
mileage and are specified in grams per kilo-
meter (g/km) (Fig. 6). Since Euro 3, emissions
are measured on a chassis dynamometer us-
ing the MNEDC (Modified New European
Driving Cycle).

Deterioration factors used to assess test re-
sults are defined in the legislation for every
pollutant component; manufacturers are
also allowed to present documentation
 confirming lower factors obtained during
specified endurance testing over 80,000 km
(100,000 km starting with Euro 4).

Compliance with the specified limits must

be maintained over a distance of 80,000 km
(Euro 3), or 100,000 km (Euro 4), or after 
5 years. 

The limits are different for vehicles with
diesel or gasoline engines. In future, they
will merge (probably by Euro 5).

The limits for the LDT category are not

uniform. There are three classes (1 to 3) 
into which LDTs are subdivided, depending
on the vehicle reference weight (unladen
weight + 100 kg). The limits for Class 1 
are the same as for cars.

Type approval
While type approval testing basically corre-
sponds to the US procedures, deviations are
encountered in the following areas: mea-
surements of the pollutants HC, CO, NOX
are supplemented by particulate and ex-
haust-gas opacity measurements on diesel
vehicles. Test vehicles absolve an initial run-
in period of 3000 kilometers before testing.

Type tests
There are six different type tests for type
 approval. The Type I, Type IV, Type V and
Type VI tests applied to vehicles with gaso-
line engines. 

The Type I test evaluates exhaust emis-
sions after cold starting. Exhaust-gas opacity
is also assessed on vehicles with diesel en-
gines. 

Type IV testing measures evaporative
emissions from parked vehicles. These emis-
sions consist primarily of the gases that
evaporate from the fuel tank.

Type VI testing embraces hydrocarbon
and carbon monoxide emissions immedi-
ately following cold starts at – 7 °C. The first
section of the MNEDC (urban portion) is
employed for this test. This test assumed
mandatory status in 2002.

Emission-control legislation

EU legislation (passenger cars/LDTs)

293

The Type V test assesses the long-term dura-
bility of the emissions-reducing equipment.
It may involve a specific test sequence, or it
may be subjected to deterioration factors
specified by the legislation. 

CO2 emissions
There are no legal emission limits for CO2.
However, the vehicle manufacturers 
(Association des Constructeurs Européen
d’Automobiles, ACEA (Association of
 European Automobile Manufacturers)) have
pledged to uphold a voluntary program. 
The objective is to achieve CO2 emissions of
max. 140 g/km for passenger cars by 2008 –
this is equivalent to a fuel consumption of
5.8 l/100 km. 

In Germany, vehicles with specially low CO2
emissions (so-called 5-liter and 3-liter cars)
will be tax-exempt until the end of 2005. 

In-field monitoring
EU legislation also calls for conformity-veri-
fication testing on in-use vehicles as part of
the Type I test cycle. The minimum number
of vehicles of a vehicle type under test is
three, while the maximum number varies
according to the test procedure. 

Vehicles under test must meet the following
criteria:
(cid:2) Mileages vary from 15,000 km to 

80,000 km, and vehicle age from 6 months
to 5 years (Euro 3). In Euro 4, the mileage
specified ranges from 15,000 km to
100,000 km.

(cid:2) Regular service inspections were carried
out as specified by the manufacturer.
(cid:2) The vehicle must show no indications of
non-standard use (e.g. tampering, major
repairs, etc.).

If emissions from an individual vehicle fail
substantially to comply with the standards,
the source of the high emissions must be de-
termined. If more than one vehicle displays
excessive emissions in random testing, no
matter what the reason, the results of the
random test must be classified as negative. 
If there are various reasons, the test schedule
may be extended, providing the maximum
sample size is not reached.

If the type-approval authorities detect that 
a vehicle type fails to meet the criteria, the
vehicle manufacturer must devise suitable
action to eliminate the defect. The action
catalog must be applicable to all vehicles
with the same defect. If necessary, a recall
action must be started.

Periodic emission testing
In Germany, all passenger cars and light-
duty trucks are required to undergo emis-
sion testing three years after their first
 registration, and then every two years. 
The procedure for emission testing in the
garage/workshop comprises the following
steps for a gasoline-engine vehicle:
(cid:2) Visually inspecting the exhaust system 
(cid:2) Checking engine speed and engine
 temperature for the following CO 
and lambda-value measurement
(cid:2) Checking the CO and lambda values

within a defined engine-speed window
(increased idle speed) at a minimum
 engine temperature

(cid:2) For vehicles with On-Board Diagnosis
(OBD): Reading out the fault memory;
reading out the readiness codes to deter-
mine whether all the diagnosis functions
have been carried out; if this is not the
case, the lambda-sensor voltage is addi-
tionally check after the CO measurement
at idle

(cid:2) In vehicles with closed-loop-controlled
three-way catalysts without OBD, the
 catalyst control loop is checked by feed-
forwarding a disturbance value

The permitted emission values are also sub-
ject to gradual stages of severity in Japan.
Further tightening of the regulations is
planned for 2005.

Vehicles with a maximum permissible
weight of up to 3.5 t are essentially divided
into three categories: passenger cars (up to
10 seats), LDVs (Light-Duty Vehicles) up to
1.7 t, and MDVs (Medium-Duty Vehicles)
up to 3.5 t. Compared with the other two
 vehicle categories, MDVs are governed by
higher limits on CO and NOX emissions 
(for gasoline-engine vehicles). For diesel
 engines, the vehicle categories are distin-
guished by NOX and particulate limits.

Emission limits
Japanese legislation specifies limits on the
following emissions:
(cid:2) Carbon monoxide (CO)
(cid:2) Nitrous oxides (NOX)
(cid:2) Hydrocarbons (NMHC)
(cid:2) Particulates (diesel vehicles only)
(cid:2) Smoke (diesel vehicles only)

Pollutant emissions are determined from a
combination of 11-mode and 10 · 15-mode
test cycles (see section entitled “Japanese test
cycle”). Cold-start emissions are thus also
taken into account. 

Corporate average fuel economy
In Japan, measures for reducing the CO2
emissions of cars are planned. One proposal
plans to fix the average fuel economy (CAFE
value) for the entire passenger-car fleet. 
The proposal foresees a gradual phase-in 
of emission limits by vehicle weight. 

FTP 75 test cycle
The FTP 75 test cycle (Federal Test Proce-
dure) consists of speed cycles that were
 actually recorded in commuter traffic in 
Los Angeles (Fig. 8a).

This test is also in force in some countries
of South America besides the USA (includ-
ing California).

Conditioning
The vehicle is subjected to an ambient
 temperature of 20...30 °C for a period of 
6 to 36 hours. 

Collecting pollutants
The vehicle is started and driven on the spe-
cific speed cycle. The emitted pollutants are
collected in separate bags during various
phases.

Phase ct (cold transient): 
Collection of exhaust gas during the cold
test phase.

Phase s (stabilized): 
Start of stabilized phase 505 seconds after
start. The exhaust gas is collected without
interrupting the driving cycle. Upon termi-
nation of phase s, after a total of 1372 sec-
onds, the engine is switched off for a period
of 600 seconds.

Phase ht (hot transient): 
The engine is restarted for the hot test. 
The speed cycle is identical to the cold
 transient phase (Phase ct). 

Analysis
The bag samples from the first two phases
are analyzed during the pause before the hot
test. This is because samples may not remain
in the bags for longer than 20 minutes.

Emission-control legislation

US test cycles for passenger cars and LDTs

295

The sample exhaust gases contained in the
third bag are also analyzed on completion of
the driving cycle. The total result includes
emissions from the three phases rated at
 different weightings. 

The pollutant masses of Phases ct and s
are aggregated and assigned to the total dis-
tance of these two phases. The result is then
weighted at a factor of 0.43. 

The same process is applied to the aggre-
gated pollutant masses from Phases ht and s,
related to the total distance of these two
phases, and weighted at a factor of 0.57. 
The test result for the individual pollutants
(HC, CO, and NOX) is obtained from the
sum of the two previous results.

SFTP schedules
Tests according to the SFTP standard
 (Supplemental Federal Test Procedure) 
were phased in from 2001 to 2004. These are
made up of the following driving cycles: 
(cid:2) FTP 75 cycle 
(cid:2) SC03 cycle (Fig. 8b), and 
(cid:2) US06 cycle (Fig. 8c)

The extended tests are intended to examine
the following additional driving conditions:

US test cycles/European test cycle for passenger cars and LDTs

Following preconditioning, the SC03 and
US06 cycles proceed through the ct phase
from FTP 75 without exhaust-gas collection.
Other conditioning procedures may also be
used.

The SC03 cycle is carried out at a temper-

ature of 35 °C and 40 % relative humidity
(vehicles with air conditioning only). 
The individual driving schedules are
weighted as follows:
(cid:2) Vehicles with air conditioning:

35 % FTP 75 + 37 % SC03 + 28 % US06

(cid:2) Vehicles without air conditioning: 

72 % FTP 75 + 28 % US06

The SFTP and FTP 75 test cycles must be
successfully completed on an individual
 basis.

Cold-start enrichment, which is necessary
when a vehicle is started at low tempera-
tures, produces particularly high emissions.
These cannot be measured in current emis-
sions testing, which is conducted at ambient
temperatures of 20...30 °C. A supplementary
emissions test is performed at – 7 °C to sup-
port enforcement of limits on these emis-
sions. However, only carbon monoxide is
subject to specified limits in this test.

Test cycles for determining corporate
average fuel economy
Each vehicle manufacturer is required 
to provide data on corporage average fuel
economy. Manufacturers that fail to comply
with the emission limits are required to pay
penalties. 

Fuel consumption is determined from the
exhaust-gas emissions produced during two
test cycles: the FTP 75 test cycle (weighted at
55 %) and the highway test cycle (weighted
at 45 %). An unmeasured highway test cycle
(Fig. 8d) is conducted once after precondi-
tioning (vehicle allowed to stand with en-
gine off for 12 hours at 20...30 °C). The ex-
haust emissions from a second test run are
then collected. The CO2 emissions are used
to calculate fuel consumption.

European test cycle for
 passenger cars and LDTs

MNEDC
The Modified New European Driving Cycle
(MNEDC) has been in force since Euro 3.
Contrary to the New European Driving
 Cycle (Euro 2), that only starts 40 seconds
after the vehicle has started, the MNEDC
also includes a cold-start phase. 

Conditioning
The vehicle is allowed to start at an ambient
temperature of 20...30 °C for a minimum
period of 6 hours. 

Since 2002 the starting temperature for
Type VI testing has been lowered to – 7 °C. 

Collecting pollutants
The exhaust gas is collected in bags during
two phases: 
(cid:2) Urban Driving Cycle (UDC) at a maxi-

mum of 50 km/h

(cid:2) Extra-urban cycle at speeds up to 120 km/h 

Analysis
The pollutant mass measured by analyzing
the bag contents is referred to the distance
covered.

trations of HC, CO, and CO2 are measured
in the exhaust pipe at idle. The 10 · 15-mode
hot test commences after a second warm-up
phase, consisting of 5 minutes at 60 km/h. 

While the cold test examines pollutants in
grams per test, the hot test’s results are de-
fined relative to distance, and are indicated
in grams per kilometer.

The exhaust-gas regulations in Japan 
include limits on evaporative emissions,
which are measured using the SHED
method (see chapter entitled “Exhaust-gas
measurement techniques”).

Japanese test cycle for
 passenger cars and LDTs

The overall test is composed of two test
 cycles based on different, synthetically
 generated driving curves. Following a cold
start, the 11-mode cycle is run four times,
with evaluation of all four cycles. The
10 · 15-mode test cycle is conducted 
once with a hot start.

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas test for type approval

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

During type-approval testing to obtain
General Certification for passenger cars 
and light-duty trucks, the exhaust-gas test 
is conducted with the vehicle mounted on a
chassis dynamometer. The test differs from
exhaust-gas tests that are conducted using
workshop/garage measuring devices for  
in-field monitoring. 

Exhaust-gas test for 
type approval

The prescribed test cycles on the chassis dy-
namometer stipulate that practical on-road
driving mode must be simulated as closely
as possible. Testing on a chassis dynamome-
ter offers many advantages compared with
on-road testing:
(cid:2) The results are easy to reproduce since the

ambient conditions are constant

(cid:2) The tests are comparable since a specified
speed/time profile is driven irrespective of
traffic flow

(cid:2) The required measuring instruments are
set up in a stationary environment 

Besides type-approval testing, exhaust-gas
measurements on the chassis dynamometer
are conducted during the development of
engine components. 

Test setup
The test vehicle is placed on a chassis dy-
namometer with its drive wheels on the
rollers (Fig. 1, Pos. 1). This means that the
forces acting on the vehicle, i.e. the vehicle’s
moments of inertia, rolling resistance, and
aerodynamic drag, must be simulated so
that the test cycle on the test bench repro-
duces emissions comparable to those ob-
tained during an on-road test. For this
 purpose, asynchronous machines, direct-
current machines, or even electrodynamic
retarders on older test benches, generate a
suitable speed-dependent load that acts on
the rollers. More modern machines use elec-
tric flywheel simulation to reproduce this
inertia. Older test benches use real flywheels
of different sizes attached by rapid couplings
to the rollers to simulate vehicle mass. A fan
mounted in front of the vehicle provides the
necessary engine cooling.

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas test for type approval

299

The test-vehicle exhaust pipe is generally 
a gas-tight attachment to the exhaust-gas
collection system – the dilution system is de-
scribed below. A proportion of the diluted
exhaust gas is collected there. At the end of
the test cycle, the gas is analyzed for pollu-
tants limited by law (hydrocarbons, nitrous
oxides, and carbon monoxide), and carbon
dioxide (to determine fuel consumption). 
In addition, and for development pur-
poses, part of the exhaust-gas flow can  
be extracted continuously from sampling
points along the vehicle’s exhaust-gas system
or dilution system to analyze pollutant con-
centrations. 

The test cycle is repeated by a driver in the
vehicle. During this cycle, the required and
current vehicle speeds are displayed on a
driver monitor. In some cases, an automated
driving system replaces the driver to increase
the reproducibility of test results by driving
the test cycle with extreme precision.

CVS dilution method
The most commonly used method of col-
lecting exhaust gases emitted from an engine
is the Constant Volume Sampling (CVS)
method. It was introduced for the first time
in the USA in 1972 for passenger cars and
light-duty trucks. In the meantime it has
been updated in several stages. The CVS
method is used in other countries, such 
as Japan. It has also been in use in Europe
since 1982. 

Objective
In the CVS method, the exhaust gas is only
analyzed at the end of the test. It is necessary
here to: 
(cid:2) Avoid the condensation of water vapor
and the resulting nitrous-oxide losses
(cid:2) Avoid secondary reactions in the collected

exhaust gas

Principle of the CVS method
The exhaust gas emitted by the test vehicle 
is diluted with ambient air (7) at an average
ratio of 1 : 5...1 : 10 and extracted using a
special pump setup. This ensures that the
 total volumetric flow, comprising exhaust
gas and dilution air, remains constant. 
The admixture of dilution air is therefore
dependent on the momentary exhaust-gas
volumetric flow. A representative sample 
is continuously extracted from the diluted
exhaust-gas flow and is collected in one or
more exhaust-gas sample bags (13). The
sampling volumetric flow is constant during
the bag-filling phase. The pollutant concen-
tration in the exhaust-gas sample bags at 
the end of the test cycle corresponds to the
average value of the concentrations in the
diluted exhaust gas for the sample-bag filling
period.

As the exhaust-gas sample bags are filled,

a sample of dilution air is taken and col-
lected in one or more air-sample bags in or-
der to measure the pollutant concentration
in the dilution air.

Filling the sample bags generally corre-
sponds to the phases in which the test cycles
are divided (e.g. the ht phase in the FTP 75
test cycle). 

The pollutant mass emitted during the
test is calculated from the total flow of di-
luted exhaust gas and the pollutant concen-
trations. 

Dilution systems
There are two alternative methods to obtain
a constant volumetric flow of diluted ex-
haust gas:
(cid:2) Positive Displacement Pump (PDP)

method: A rotary-piston blower (Roots
blower) is used

(cid:2) Critical Flow Venturi (CFV) method: 
A venturi tube and a standard blower 
are used in the critical state

300

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas test for type approval, exhaust-gas analyzers

Advances in the CVS method
Diluting the exhaust gas causes a reduction
in pollutant concentrations as a factor of di-
lution. As pollutant emissions have dropped
significantly in the past few years due to the
growing severity of emission limits, the con-
centrations of some pollutants (in particular
hydrogen compounds) in the diluted ex-
haust gas are equivalent to concentrations 
in diluted air in certain test phases (or are
even lower). This poses a problem from the
measuring-process aspect, as the difference
between the two values is crucial for mea-
suring exhaust-gas emissions. A further
challenge is presented by the precision of
analyzers used to measure small concentra-
tions of pollutants.

To tackle these problems, more recent CVS
dilution systems apply the following mea-
sures:
(cid:2) Lower the dilution: This requires precau-
tionary measures to guard against the
condensation of water, e.g., heating parts
of the dilution systems, in gasoline-engine
vehicles also drying or heating the dilu-
tion air

(cid:2) Reduce and stabilize pollutant concentra-
tions in the dilution air, e.g., by using car-
bon canisters

(cid:2) Optimize the measuring instruments

 (including dilution systems), e.g., by se-
lecting or preconditioning the materials
used and system setups; by using modified
electronic components

(cid:2) Optimize processes, e.g., by using special

purge procedures

Bag mini diluter
As an alternative to advances in CVS tech-
nology described above, a new type of dilu-
tion system was developed in the US: the
Bag Mini Diluter (BMD). Here, part of the
exhaust gas flow is diluted at a constant ratio
with dried, heated zero gas (e.g., cleaned
air). During the test, part of the diluted
 exhaust-gas flow that is proportional to 
the  exhaust-gas volumetric flow is filled in
 (exhaust-gas) sample bags and analyzed 

at the end of the driving test. Diluting the
exhaust gas with a pollution-free zero gas
dispenses with air-sample bag analysis fol-
lowed by taking the difference between the
exhaust-gas and air-sample bag concentra-
tions. However, a more complex procedure
is required than for the CVS method, 
e.g., one requirement is to determine the
(undiluted) exhaust-gas volumetric flow 
and the proportional sample-bag filling.

Exhaust-gas analyzers

Emission-control legislation defines interna-
tionally standardized test procedures for
emission-limit pollutants in order to mea-
sure the concentrations in exhaust-gas and
air-sample bags (Table 1).

surement of pollutant concentrations in 
the vehicle exhaust-gas system or dilution
system. The reason is to capture data on
emission-limit components, as well as other
components not subject to legislation. 
Other test procedures than those mentioned
in Table 1 required for this, e.g.: 
(cid:2) Paramagnetic method (for determining

the O2 concentration)

(cid:2) Cutter FID: Combination of a flame-ion-
ization detector with an absorber for non-
methane hydrocarbons (for determining
the CH4 concentration)

(cid:2) Mass spectroscopy (multi-component

 analyzer)

(cid:2) FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) spec-
troscopy (multi components analyzer)
(cid:2) Infrared-laser spectrometer (multi-com-

ponent analyzer)

NDIR analyzer
The NDIR (Non-Dispersive InfraRed)
 analyzer uses the property of certain gases 
to absorb infrared radiation within a narrow
characteristic wavelength band. The ab-
sorbed radiation is converted into vibra-
tional and rotational energy of the absorb-
ing molecules.

In the NDIR analyzer, the analysis gas flows
through the absorption cell (vessel), where 
it is exposed to infrared radiation (Fig. 2,
Pos. 2). The gas absorbs radiation energy
within the characteristic wavelength band of
the pollutant, whereby the radiation energy
is proportional to the concentration of the
pollutant under analysis. A reference cell (7)
arranged in parallel to the absorption cell is
filled with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, N2). 

The detector (9) is located at the opposite
end of the cell to the infrared light source
and measures the residual energy from in-
frared radiation in the measurement and
reference cells. The detector comprises two
chambers connected by a membrane and
containing samples of the gas components
under analysis. The reference-cell radiation
characteristic for this component is ab-
sorbed in one chamber. The other absorbs
radiation from the test-gas vessel. The differ-
ence between the radiation received and 
the radiation absorbed in the two detector
chambers results in a pressure differential,
and thus a deflection in the diaphragm be-
tween the measuring and reference detec-
tors. This deflection is a measure of the pol-
lutant concentration in the test-gas vessel.

A rotating chopper (8) interrupts infrared

radiation cyclically, causing an alternating
deflection of the diaphragm, and thus a
modulation of the sensor signal. 

NDIR analyzers have a strong cross-sensitiv-
ity 1) to water vapor in the test gas, since
H2O molecules absorb infrared radiation
across a broad wavelength band. This is the
reason why NDIR analyzers are positioned
downstream of a test-gas treatment system
(e.g., a gas cooler) to dry the exhaust gas
when they are used to make measurements
on undiluted exhaust gas.

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas analyzers

Chemiluminescence detector (CLD)
Due to its measuring principle, the CLD is
limited to determining NO concentrations.
Before measuring the aggregate of NO2
and NO concentrations, the test gas is first
routed to a converter that reduces NO2
into NO.

The test gas is mixed with ozone in a
 reaction chamber (Fig. 3) to determine the
nitrogen monoxide concentration (NO).
The nitrogen monoxide contained in the 
test gas oxidizes in this environment to form
NO2; some of the molecules produced are in
a state of excitation. When these molecules
return to their basic state, energy is released
in the form of light (chemiluminescence). 
A detector, e.g. a photomultiplier, measures
the emitted luminous energy; under specific
conditions, it is proportional to the nitro-
gen-monoxide concentration in the test gas.

Flame-ionization detector (FID)
The hydrocarbons present in the test gas are
burned off in a hydrogen flame (Fig. 4). This
forms carbon radicals; some of the radicals
are ionized temporarily. The radicals are dis-
charged at a collector electrode; the current
produced is measured and is proportional to
the number of carbon atoms in the test gas. 

GC-FID and Cutter FID
There are two equally common methods 
to measure methane concentration in the
test gas. Each method consists of the combi-
nation of a CH4-separating element and a
flame-ionization detector. Either a gas-chro-
motography column (GC-FID), or a heated
catalytic converter, oxidizes the non-CH4 hy-
drocarbons (cutter FID) in order to separate
methane. Unlike the cutter FID, the GC-FID
can only determine CH4 concentration dis-
continuously (typical interval between two
measurements: 30...45 seconds).

Paramagnetic detector (PMD)
There are different designs of paramagnetic
detectors (dependent on the manufacturer).
The measuring principle is based on inho-
mogenous magnetic fields that exert forces
on molecules with paramagnetic properties
(such as oxygen), causing the molecules to
move. The movement is proportional to the
concentration of molecules in the test gas
and is sensed by a special detector.

Evaporative-emissions test

303

Evaporative-emissions test

A gasoline-engine motor vehicle emits
 hydrocarbons (HCs) through evaporation 
of fuel from the fuel tank and circuit. 
The amounts of fuel that evaporate vary
 according to the fuel temperature and the
individual vehicle’s design configuration. 
In some countries (e.g., USA and Europe),
regulations are in place to limit these
 evaporative losses.

Test principle
These evaporative emissions are usually
quantified with the aid of a hermetically
sealed SHED (Sealed House for Evaporation
Determination) chamber. For the test, 
HC concentrations are measured at the
 beginning and the end of the test, with 
the  difference representing the evaporative
losses.

Evaporative emissions are measured un-
der some or all of the following conditions –
depending upon individual country – and
must comply with the stipulated limits:
(cid:2) Evaporation emerging from the fuel
 system in the course of the day: 
“tank ventilation test” or “diurnal test”
(EU and USA)

(cid:2) Evaporation that emerges from the fuel
system when the vehicle is parked with
the engine warm following operation:
“hot parking test” or “hot soak” (EU and
USA)

(cid:2) Evaporation during on-the-road opera-

tion: “running-loss test” (USA)

Evaporation is measured in several phases.
Prior to testing, the vehicle undergoes pre-
conditioning in a process including the
 carbon canister. With the tank filled to 
the stipulated level of 40 %, testing starts.

1st test: Hot-soak losses
Before testing to determine evaporative
emissions in this phase, the vehicle is first
warmed to normal operating temperature
using the test cycle valid in the particular
country. It is then parked in the SHED

chamber. The increase in HC concentration
within a period of 1 hour is measured dur-
ing the vehicle’s cooling period.

The vehicle’s windows and trunk lid 
must remain open throughout the test. 
This makes it possible for the test to include
evaporative losses from the vehicle’s interior
in its results.

2nd test: Tank-ventilation losses
In this test, a typical temperature profile for
a hot summer day (maximum temperature
for EU: 35 °C; EPA: 35.5 °C; CARB: 40.6 °C)
is simulated within the hermetically sealed
climate chamber. The hydrocarbons emitted
by the vehicle under these conditions are
then collected. 

The USA requires testing in both 2-day

diurnal (48-hour) and 3-day diurnal 
(72-hour) procedures. EU legislation
 prescribes a 24-hour test.

Running-loss test
The running-loss test is conducted prior 
to the hot-soak test. It is used to assess the
hydrocarbon emissions generated during
 vehicle operation in the prescribed test
 cycles (1 FTP 72 cycle, 2 NYCC cycles, 
1 FTP 72 cycle; refer to section entitled 
“US test cycles”).

Other tests 
Refueling test
The refueling test monitors evaporation of
fuel vapors emitted during refueling by mea-
suring HC emissions. In the US, this test is
used in both CARB and EPA procedures.

Spit-back test
The spit-back test monitors the amount of
fuel spray generated during each refueling
process. The tank must be refueled to at least
85 % of its total volume. This test is only
carried out if the refueling test has not be
completed.

Diagnosis

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Monitoring during 
vehicle  operation
(on-board  diagnosis)
Overview
Integral diagnostic functions included
within the ECU are a standard component
in electronic engine-management systems.
Besides a self-test of the ECU, input and
output signals, and ECU intercommunica-
tion are monitored.

On-board diagnosis of an electronic sys-
tem is the capability of an ECU to interpret
and perform self-monitoring using “soft-
ware intelligence”, i.e., detect, store, and
 diagnostically interpret errors and faults.
On-board diagnosis runs without the use 
of any additional equipment.

Monitoring algorithms check input and

output signals during vehicle operation, 
and check the entire system and all its rele-
vant functions for malfunctions and distur-
bances. Any errors or faults detected are
stored in the ECU fault memory. Stored
fault information can be read out via a 
serial interface.

Diagnosis

The rise in the sheer amount of electronics
in the automobile, the use of software to
control the vehicle, and the increased com-
plexity of modern fuel-injection systems
place high demands on the diagnostic con-
cept, monitoring during vehicle operation
(on-board diagnosis), and workshop diag-
nosis (Fig. 1). Workshop diagnosis is based
on a guided troubleshooting procedure that
links the many possibilities of on-board and
off-board test procedures and test equip-
ment. As emission-control legislation
 becomes more and more stringent and
 continuous monitoring is now called for,
lawmakers have now acknowledged on-
board diagnosis as an aid to monitoring
 exhaust emissions, and have produced 
manufacturer-independent standardization.
This additional system is termed the 
OBD system (On-Board-Diagnosis system).

Diagnosis

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

305

Monitoring of input signals
Sensors, plug connectors, and connecting
lines (signal path) to the ECU (Fig. 2) are
monitored by evaluating the input signal.
This monitoring strategy is capable of
 detecting sensor errors, short circuits in 
the battery-power circuit UBatt and vehicle-
ground circuit, and line breaks. The follow-
ing methods are used:
(cid:2) Monitoring sensor supply voltage (if 

applicable)

(cid:2) Checking the detected value for the per-
missible value range (e.g., 0.5…4.5 V)
(cid:2) If additional information is available, a
plausibility check is conducted using 
the detected value (e.g., comparison of
crankshaft speed and camshaft speed)
(cid:2) Critical sensors (e.g., pedal-travel sensor)
are fitted in redundant configuration,
which means that their signals can be
 directly compared with each other

Monitoring of output signals
Actuators triggered by an ECU via output
stages (Fig. 2) are monitored. The monitor-
ing functions detect line breaks and short
circuits in addition to actuator faults. 
The following methods are used:
(cid:2) Monitoring the progress of output signals
through the output driver circuit. The
electric circuit is monitored for short cir-
cuits to battery voltage UBatt, to vehicle
ground, and for open circuit.

(cid:2) Impacts on the system by the actuator 
are detected directly or indirectly by a
function or plausibility monitor. System
actuators, e.g., exhaust-gas recirculation
valves, throttle valves, or swirl flaps, are
monitored indirectly via control loops
(e.g. continuous control variance), and
also partly by means of position sensors
(e.g. position of the swirl flap).

Diagnosis

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Fault handling
Fault detection
A signal path is categorized as finally defec-
tive if a fault occurs over a definite period of
time. Until the defect is categorized, the sys-
tem uses the last valid value detected. When
the defect is categorized, a standby function
is triggered (e.g., engine-temperature substi-
tute value T = 90 °C).

Most faults can be rectified or detected 
as intact during vehicle operation, provided
the signal path remains intact for a definite
period of time.

Fault storage
Each fault is stored as a fault code in the
non-volatile area of the data memory. 
The fault code also describes the fault type
(e.g. short circuit, line break, plausibility,
value range exceeded). Each fault-code input
is accompanied by additional information,
e.g. the operating and environmental condi-
tions (freeze frame) at the time of fault oc-
currence (e.g. engine speed, engine tempera-
ture). 

Limp-home function
If a fault is detected, limp-home strategies
can be triggered in addition to substitute
values (e.g., engine output power or speed
limited). These strategies serve to 
(cid:2) Maintain driving safety
(cid:2) Avoid consequential damage, or
(cid:2) Minimize exhaust emissions

Monitoring of internal ECU functions
Monitoring functions are implemented in
ECU hardware (e.g. “intelligent” output-
stage modules) and software to ensure that
the ECU functions correctly at all times. 
The monitoring functions check each of the
ECU components (e.g., microcontroller,
Flash-EPROM, RAM). Many tests are con-
ducted immediately after startup. Other
monitoring functions are performed during
normal operation and repeated at regular
intervals in order to detect component fail-
ure during operation. Test runs that require
intensive CPU capacity, or that cannot be
performed during vehicle operation for
other reasons, are conducted in after-run
more when the engine is switched off. This
method ensures that the other functions are
not interfered with. In the common-rail sys-
tem for diesel engines, functions such as the
injector switchoff paths are tested during
engine runup or after-run. With a spark-
 ignition engine, functions such as the Flash-
EPROM are tested in engine after-run.

Monitoring of ECU communication
Communication with the other ECUs usu-
ally takes place over the CAN bus. The CAN
protocol contains control mechanisms to
detect malfunctions. As a result, transmis-
sion errors are even detectable at CAN-
module level. The ECU also runs a variety 
of other test routines. Since the majority of
CAN messages are sent at regular intervals
by the individual ECUs, the failure of a 
CAN controller in an ECU is detectable 
by testing at regular intervals. In addition,
when redundant information is available in
the ECU, the received signals are checked in
the same way as all input signals.

Diagnosis

On-board-diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

307

Normally, the diagnostic functions for all
components and systems under surveillance
must run at least once during the exhaust-
gas test cycle (e.g. FTP 72). A further stipula-
tion is that all diagnostic functions must run
with sufficient frequency during daily driv -
ing mode. For many monitoring functions,
the law defines a monitoring frequency 
(In Use Monitor Performance Ratio) in 
daily operation starting model year 2005.

Since the introduction of OBD II, the law
has been revised in several stages (updates).
The last update came into force in model
year 2004. Further updates have been an-
nounced.

OBD (EPA)
Since 1994 the laws of the EPA (Environ-
mental Protection Agency) have been in
force in the remaining US states. While the
EPA stipulations governing diagnostic
 capabilities are essentially the same as the
CARB rules (OBD II), the OBD regulations
for CARB and EPA apply to all passenger
cars with up to 12 seats and to light-duty
trucks weighing up to 14,000 lbs (6.35 t).

EOBD (EU)
OBD adapted to European conditions is
termed EOBD and is based on EPA-OBD. 
EOBD has been valid for all passenger
cars and light-duty trucks equipped with
gasoline engines and weighing up to 3.5 t
with up to 9 seats since January 2000. 
Since January 2003 the EOBD also applies 
to passenger cars and light-duty trucks with
diesel engines.

Other countries
A number of other countries have already
adopted or are planning to adopt EU or 
US-OBD legislation.

On-board-diagnosis system
for passenger cars and 
light-duty trucks
The engine system and its components must
be constantly monitored in order to comply
with exhaust-emission limits specified by
law in everyday driving situations. For this
reason, regulations have come into force to
monitor exhaust systems and components,
e.g., in California. This has standardized and
expanded manufacturer-specific on-board
diagnosis with respect to the monitoring of
emission-related components and systems.

Legislation
OBD I (CARB)
1988 marked the coming into force in
 California of OBD I, the first stage of CARB
legislation (California Air Resources Board).
The first OBD stage stipulates the following
requirements:
(cid:2) Monitoring emission-related electrical
components (short circuits, line breaks)
and storage of faults in the ECU fault
memory

(cid:2) A Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) 
that alerts the driver to the malfunction
(cid:2) The defective component must be dis-

played by means of on-board equipment
(e.g. flashing code using a diagnosis lamp)

OBD II (CARB)
The second stage of the diagnosis legislation
(OBD II) came into force in California in
1994. OBD II became mandatory for diesel-
engine cars with effect from 1996. In addi-
tion to the scope of OBD I, system function-
ality was now monitored (e.g., plausibility
check of sensor signals).

OBD II stipulates that all emission-related

systems and components must be moni-
tored if they cause an increase in toxic
 exhaust emissions in the event of a mal -
function (by exceeding the OBD limits).
Moreover, all components must be moni-
tored if they are used to monitor emission-
related components or if they can affect 
the diagnosis results.

308

Diagnosis

On-board-diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Requirements of the OBD system
The ECU must use suitable measures to
monitor all on-board systems and compo-
nents whose malfunction may cause a dete-
rioration in exhaust-gas test specifications
stipulated by law. The Malfunction Indicator
Lamp (MIL) must alert the driver to a mal-
function if the malfunction could cause an
overshoot in OBD emission limits.

Emission limits
US OBD II (CARB and EPA) prescribes
thresholds that are defined relative to emis-
sion limits. Accordingly, there are different
permissible OBD emission limits for the
various exhaust-gas categories that are
 applied during vehicle certification (e.g.
TIER, LEV, ULEV). Absolute limits  apply 
in Europe (Table 1).

Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL)
The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
alerts the driver that a component has mal-
functioned. When a malfunction is detected,
CARB and EPA stipulate that the MIL must
light up no later than after two driving cy-
cles of its occurrence. Within the scope of
EOBD, the MIL must light up no later than
in the third driving cycle with a detected
malfunction. 

If the malfunction disappears (e.g. loose
contact), the malfunction remains entered
in the fault memory for 40 trips (warm-up
cycles). The MIL goes out after three fault-
free driving cycles.

Communication with scan tool
OBD legislation prescribes standardization
of the fault-memory information and access
to the information (connector, communica-
tion interface) compliant with ISO 15 031
and the corresponding SAE standards (Soci-
ety of Automotive Engineers). This permits
the readout of the fault memory using stan-
dardized, commercially available testers
(scan tools, see Fig. 3).

The following communication protocols

are approved for communication with an
OBD scan tool:

ISO 15765-4
SAE J1850
ISO 9141-2
ISO 14230-4

OBD II, EOBD
OBD II up to MY 2007, EOBD
OBD II up to MY 2007, EOBD

Scan tool
These serial interfaces operate at a bit rate
(baud rate) of 5 to 10.4 kbaud. They are
 single-wire interfaces with a common trans-
mitting and receiving line. There are also
two-wire interfaces with separate data line
(K-line) and initiate line (L-line). 

Workshop tester
Several ECUs (such as Motronic, ESP, or
EDC, and transmission-shift control, etc.)
can be combined on one diagnosis con -
nector.

Communication between the tester and
ECU is set up in three phases:
(cid:2) Initiate the ECU
(cid:2) Detect and generate baud rate
(cid:2) Read key bytes which serve to identify the
communications protocol (not for CAN) 

To make it easier to read out the ECU fault-
memory information, a standardized diag-
nosis socket will be fitted at an easily accessi-
ble place in every car (easy to reach from the
driver’s seat). The socket is used to connect
the scan tool (Fig. 4). 

Evaluation is performed subsequently. 
The following functions are possible: 
(cid:2) Identify the ECU 
(cid:2) Read the fault memory 
(cid:2) Erase the fault memory 
(cid:2) Read the actual values 

In future, the CAN bus (ISO 15 765-4) will
be used increasingly to handle communica-
tion between ECUs and the tester. Starting
in 2008 diagnosis will only be permitted
over this interface in the USA.

Reading the fault information
Any workshop can use the scan tool to read
out emission-relevant fault information
from the ECU (Fig. 5). In this way, work-
shops not franchized to a particular manu-
facturer are also able to carry out repairs.
Manufacturers are obliged to make the
 required tools and information available 
(on the internet) in return for a reasonable
payment, to allow this.

Diagnosis

On-board-diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

closed. For instance, tank ventilation (evap-
orative-emissions control system) in a gaso-
line system cannot function when catalytic-
converter diagnosis is in operation.

Temporary disabling of diagnostic functions
Diagnostic capabilities may only be disabled
under certain conditions in order to prevent
false diagnosis. Examples include:
(cid:2) Height too large
(cid:2) Low ambient temperature on engine

starting, or 

(cid:2) Low battery voltage

Readiness code
When the fault memory is checked, it is im-
portant to know that the diagnostic capabili-
ties ran at least once. This can be checked by
reading out the readiness code over the diag-
nosis interface. After the fault memory has
been erased by service personnel, the readi-
ness codes must be reset after the functions
have been checked.

Diagnostic system management (DSM)
The diagnostic capabilities for all compo-
nents and systems checked must normally
run in driving mode, but at least once dur-
ing the exhaust-gas test cycle (e.g. FTP 72,
NEDC). Diagnostic System Management
(DSM) can change the sequence for running
the diagnostic capabilities dynamically,
 depending on driving conditions.

The DSM comprises the following three

components (Fig. 6):

Diagnosis fault path management (DFPM)
The primary role of DFPM is to store fault
states that are detected in the system. In ad-
dition to faults, it also stores other informa-
tion, such as environmental conditions
(freeze frame).

Recalls
If vehicles fail to comply with OBD require-
ments by law, the authorities may demand
the vehicle manufacturer to start a recall at
his own cost.

Functional requirements
Overview
Just as for on-board diagnosis, all ECU in-
put and output signals, as well as the com-
ponents themselves, must be monitored. 
Legislation demands the monitoring 
of electrical functions (short circuit, line
breaks), a plausibility check for sensors, 
and a function monitoring for actuators.

The pollutant concentration expected as
the result of a component failure (measured
values), and the monitoring mode partly
 required by law determine the type of diag-
nosis. A simple functional test (black/white
test) only checks system or component op-
erability (e.g. swirl flap opens and closes).
The extensive functional test provides more
detailed information about system operabil-
ity. As a result, the limits of adaptation must
be monitored when monitoring adaptive
fuel-injection functions (e.g., zero-delivery
calibration for a diesel engine, lambda 
adaptation for a gasoline engine). 

Diagnostic complexity has constantly
 increased as emission-control legislation 
has evolved. 

Switch-on conditions
Diagnostic capabilities only run if the
switch-on conditions are satisfied. 
These include, for instance: 
(cid:2) Torque thresholds
(cid:2) Engine-temperature thresholds, and
(cid:2) Engine-speed thresholds or limits

Inhibit conditions
Diagnostic capabilities and engine functions
cannot always operate simultaneously. 
There are inhibit conditions that prohibit
the performance of certain functions. In the
diesel system, the hot-film air-mass meter
(HFM) can only be monitored satisfactorily
when the exhaust-gas recirculation valve is

Diagnostic function scheduler (DSCHED)
DSCHED is responsible for coordinating
 assigned engine and diagnostic capabilities.
It is supported in this process by informa-
tion received from the DVAL and DFPM. 
In addition, it reports functions that require
release by DSCHED to perform their readi-
ness, after which the current system state is
checked.

Diagnosis validator (DVAL)
The DVAL (only installed in gasoline sys-
tems to date) uses current fault-memory
 entries and additionally stored information
to decide for each detected fault whether it 
is the actual cause, or a consequence of the
fault. As a result, validation provides stored
information to the diagnosis tester for use 
in reading out the fault memory.

In this way, diagnostic capabilities can 
be released in any sequence. All released
 diagnoses and their results are evaluated
subsequently.

Catalytic-converter diagnosis
The function of the three-way catalytic
 converter is to convert to safer substances
the harmful emissions of carbon monoxide
(CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and hydrocar-
bons (HC) that are produced by the com-
bustion process. Aging or damage (thermal,
poisoning) can diminish the converter’s effi-
ciency. Therefore, the effectiveness of the
catalytic converter has to be monitored.

One measure of catalytic-converter effi-
ciency is its oxygen-storage capacity. To date,
it has been possible to demonstrate a corre-
lation between oxygen-storage capacity and
converter efficiency for all types of three-
way catalytic-converter coating (washcoat
with ceroxides as oxygen-storing component
and noble metals as the actual catalysts).

Depending on the requirements regarding

emission reduction, one or more main cat-
alytic converters (usually underfloor cat-
alytic converters) are used either alone or in
combination with one or more primary cat-
alytic converters close to the engine. Primary
mixture control takes places using a lambda
sensor upstream of the first catalytic con-
verter in the exhaust system. Present-day
concepts incorporate secondary lambda
 sensors downstream of the primary catalytic
converter and/or the main converter. 
They serve the purpose firstly to fine-tune
the  primary lambda sensor(s) and secondly
for the OBD functions. The basic principle

of catalytic-converter diagnosis is to com-
pare the sensor signals upstream and down-
stream of the converter under review.

Diagnosis of primary catalytic converter
In systems in which the secondary lambda
sensor is located directly after the primary
catalytic converter, the primary catalytic
converter can be separately monitored.
 Diagnosis is based on the following princi-
ple: The setpoint value for lambda closed-
loop control is modulated at a specific fre-
quency and amplitude (Fig. 7). The varia-
tions in the oxygen content of the exhaust
gas resulting from these fluctuations in the
control settings are attenuated in the cat-
alytic converter by absorbing or releasing
oxygen in the converter coating material, 
i.e. the rear sensor emits a signal with a very
small amplitude (Fig. 9, top signal curve). 

By contrast, a primary catalytic converter
that has lost its oxygen-storage capacity as a
result of aging or damage produces an oscil-
lating two-point signal since almost no at-
tenuation takes place (Fig. 9, bottom signal
curve). Loss of oxygen-storage capacity can
be calculated from the amplitude by filtering
the signal in a special process. Conclusions
can then be drawn as to converter efficiency.

Diagnosis of main catalytic converter
The entire arrangement of primary catalytic
converter and main converter is monitored
(Fig. 8) on systems in which the secondary
lambda sensor is positioned downstream 
of the main catalytic converter. However, 
the oxygen-storage capacity of the main cat-
alytic converter is far greater than a smaller
primary catalytic converter. This means that
the regulation of the control setpoint is still
significantly damped even if the converter 
is damaged. For this reason, a change in the
oxygen concentration downstream of the
main catalytic converter is too small for pas-
sive assessment, as in the method described
above. This necessitates a diagnosis process
involving active intervention in the lambda
closed-loop control system.

Diagnosis of the main catalytic converter

is based on measuring oxygen storage di-
rectly on changeover from rich to lean mix-
ture. A constant broad-band lambda sensor
is fitted upstream of the catalytic converter
and measures the oxygen content in the ex-
haust gas. Downstream of the catalytic con-
verter is a two-step lambda sensor which de-
tects the condition of the oxygen accumula-
tor. The reading is taken under static engine-
operating conditions in the part-load range.

In the first stage of the process, the oxygen
accumulator is completely emptied while 
the engine is running with a rich mixture 
(λ < 1). The signal from the rear lambda
sensor indicates this by a voltage of > 650 mV.
In the next stage, while the engine is running
with a lean mixture (λ > 1), the mass of oxy-
gen absorbed to the point at which the accu-
mulator reaches overflow is calculated with
the aid of the air-mass flow and the primary
lambda-sensor signal. The point of overflow
is indicated by the signal voltage from the
sensor downstream of the catalytic converter
dropping to < 200 mV. The calculated inte-
gral of the oxygen mass indicates the oxy-
gen-storage capacity. That figure must ex-
ceed a reference figure, otherwise a fault is
recorded.

Theoretically, the analysis would also be
possible by measuring the amount of oxygen
released on changeover from lean to rich
mixture. However, measuring the amount 
of oxygen absorbed on changeover from rich
to lean mixture offers the following benefits:
(cid:2) Less dependence on temperature, and
(cid:2) Less dependence on sulfurization

This method allows more accurate measure-
ment of oxygen-storage capacity.

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

or contamination (e.g., sulfur absorption).
Therefore, its functional capacity has to be
monitored. This can be achieved with the
aid of lambda sensors fitted upstream and
downstream of the catalytic converter, or 
an NOX sensor in place of the downstream
lambda sensor.

In order to determine the catalytic-con-
verter quality factor, the actual NOX accu-
mulator capacity is compared with the NOX
accumulator capacity of a new NOX accu-
mulator-type catalytic converter (new cat-
alytic-converter model, Fig. 10). The actual
NOX storage capacity is equal to the metered
consumption of reduction agents (HC and
CO) during catalytic-converter regenera-
tion. The quantity of reduction agents is de-
termined by integrating the reduction-agent
mass flow during the regeneration phase
when λ < 1. The end of the regeneration
phase is indicated by an abrupt change in
the signal voltage detected by the secondary
oxygen sensor.

Alternatively, the actual NOX accumulator
capacity can be determined by means of an
NOX sensor.

Diagnosis of NOX accumulator-type 
catalytic converter
As well as functioning as a three-way cat-
alytic converter, the NOX accumulator-type
catalytic converter required for gasoline
 direct-injection engines has the task of tem-
porarily storing the nitrous oxides that can-
not be converted when the engine is running
on a lean mixture (λ > 1). It then converts
them at a later stage when the engine is
 running with a homogeneously distributed
air/fuel mixture of (λ < 1). The NOX storage
capacity of this catalytic converter – indi-
cated by the catalytic-converter quality
 factor – diminishes as a result of aging

Combustion-miss detection
Current legislation demands detection of
combustion misses that may be caused by
worn-out spark plugs, for example. A miss
occurs when the spark plug fails to produce
an ignition spark. The result is that combus-
tion of the air/fuel mixture does not take
place and unburnt fuel is emitted into the
exhaust-gas system. Consequently, misses
 result in afterburning of unburnt fuel in the
catalytic converter and cause a temperature
rise. This can lead to more rapid aging or
even complete destruction of the catalytic
converter. In addition, misses increase ex-
haust-gas emissions, particularly of HC 
and CO. Detection of misses is therefore 
a necessity.

The miss detection function measures 
the time elapsed between one combustion
stroke and the next – the cycle time – for
each cylinder. This time is derived from the
speed-sensor signal. The time it takes a cer-
tain number of teeth to pass the crankshaft
sensor wheel is measured. If the engine has 
a combustion miss, it does not produce the
amount of torque that would normally be
expected. The result is that it rotates at a
slower speed. A significant increase in the
 resulting cycle time is an indication of mis-
firing (Fig. 11).

At high engine speeds and low engine load,
the increase in cycle time is only about
0.2 %. Consequently, precise monitoring of
engine rotation and a complex calculation
method are required in order to distinguish
misfiring from other effects (e.g., judder
caused by poor road surface).

Sensor-wheel compensation corrects 
for discrepancies arising from variations 
in manufacturing tolerances in the sensor
wheel. This function is only active when the
engine is overrunning since no acceleration
torque is generated under these operating
conditions. Sensor-wheel compensation
supplies correction values for the cycle
times.

If the combustion-miss rate exceeds a per-
missible level, fuel injection to the cylinder(s)
concerned is deactivated in order to protect
the catalytic converter. 

Fuel-tank leakage diagnosis
It is not only exhaust-gas emissions that are
harmful to the environment. Evaporative
emissions escaping from the fuel system –
especially the fuel tank – are equally unde-
sirable and consequently subject to emission
limits as well. In order to limit evaporative
emissions, evaporated fuel is collected by 
the activated carbon canister in the evapora-
tive-emissions control system. They are 
then released to the intake manifold via 
the canister-purge valve from where it joins
the normal combustion process (Fig. 12).
Monitoring the fuel-tank system is part of
the on-board diagnostic functions. 

Legislation for the European market is
initially limited to straightforward checking
of the electrical circuits for the fuel-tank
pressure sensor and the canister-purge valve.
In the US, on the other hand, detection 
of leaks from the fuel system is required.
There are two different diagnosis methods
for leakage detection. They can detect a
 major leak with a flow diameter of up to 
1.0 mm and a minor leak with a flow
 diameter of up to 0.5 mm.

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Vacuum-relief diagnosis method 
When the vehicle is stationary and the en-
gine idling, the canister-purge valve (Fig. 12,
Pos. 2) is closed. As the shutoff valve (4) is
open, air is drawn into the tank by the vac-
uum inside the tank. The pressure in the
tank system then increases. If the pressure
measured by the pressure sensor (6) does
not reach atmospheric pressure within a cer-
tain period of time, it is assumed that the
shutoff valve has failed to open sufficiently
or at all and is therefore faulty. 

If a shutoff-valve fault is not detected, the

valve is closed. Fuel evaporation may now 
be expected to cause a pressure increase. 
The resulting pressure may not exceed
 specific upper and lower limits. 

If the pressure measured is below the
specified lower limit, the canister-purge
valve is faulty. In other words, the lack of
pressure is caused by a leaking canister-
purge valve which is allowing vapor to be
drawn out of the fuel tank by the vacuum 
in the intake manifold. 

If the pressure measured is above the
specified upper limit, this indicates that too
much fuel is evaporating (e.g., due to high
ambient temperature) for diagnosis to be
carried out. 

If the pressure produced by fuel evaporation
is within the specified limits, then the pres-
sure rise is stored as the compensation gra-
dient for minor-leak detection. 

Only after testing the shutoff and canister-
purge valves can fuel-tank leakage diagnosis
be continued.

Major-leak detection is performed first.
When the engine is idling, the canister-purge
valve (2) is opened. As a result, the vacuum
in the intake manifold (1) “spreads” to the
fuel-tank system. If the pressure change de-
tected by the fuel-tank pressure sensor (6) 
is too small because air is able to enter due 
to a leak to balance out the induced pressure
drop, a major leak is detected and the fault-
diagnosis sequence is terminated.

The minor-leak diagnosis can start once the
diagnosis system has failed to identify a ma-
jor leak. This starts by closing the canister-
purge valve (2) again. The pressure should
then only increase by the fuel-evaporation
rate (compensation gradient) previously
stored, since the shutoff valve (4) is still
closed. If the pressure increases at a higher
rate, there must be a minor leak through
which air is able to enter.

Overpressure method
If the diagnosis-activation conditions are
satisfied and the ignition is switched off, 
the overpressure test is started as part of 
the ECU run-on sequence. 

For minor-leak detection, the electric
vane pump (Fig. 13a, Pos. 6) integrated in
the diagnosis module (4) pumps air through
a “reference leak” (5) which has a diameter
of 0.5 mm. As a result of the back pressure
caused by the constriction at that point, 
the load on the pump increases, resulting 
in a drop in pump speed and an increase in
electric current. That current level (Fig. 14)
is measured and stored (4).

Next (Fig. 13b), the solenoid valve (7) is
switched over and the pump pumps air into
the fuel tank. If there are no leaks in the
tank, the pressure increases and the pump
current rises accordingly (Fig. 14) to a 
level higher than the reference current (3). 
If there is a minor leak, the pump current
will reach the reference current but not ex-
ceed it (2). If the pump current fails to reach
the reference current after an extended pe-
riod, a major leak is present (1).

Diagnosis of secondary-air injection
Running the engine with a rich mixture 
(λ < 1) – which is necessary in cold weather,
for example – leads to high concentrations
of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in
the exhaust gas. These emissions have to 
be re-oxidized in the exhaust system, i.e.,
passed through an afterburning process.
Therefore, most vehicles have a secondary-
air injection facility which blows the oxygen
required for catalytic afterburning into the
exhaust gas directly downstream of the
 exhaust manifold (Fig. 15). 

If this system fails, there will be an increase
in exhaust-gas emissions when cold-starting
the engine or before the catalytic converter
has reached operating temperature. For this
reason, a diagnosis function is required.

Diagnosis of secondary-air injection is a
function check which establishes whether
the pump is working properly and whether
there are problems with the air pipe to the
exhaust-gas system. The check can be per-
formed in two ways.

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

The passive test takes place immediately
 after the engine is started and while the
 catalytic converter is being heated up. It in-
volves the secondary-air system measuring
the mass of secondary air injected. It uses an
active lambda closed-loop control system
and compares the secondary-air mass with 
a reference figure. If the calculated air mass
differs from the reference figure, a fault is
detected. 

The active test involves activating sec-
ondary-air injection for diagnostic purposes
only during the engine idle phase. The sig-
nals from the lambda sensors are used di-
rectly for calculating the secondary-air mass.
As with the passive test, the calculated sec-
ondary-air mass flow rate is compared with
a reference value.

Although less accurate, the passive test is
necessary because it is precisely during the
period when the engine has only been run-
ning for a short time that secondary-air in-
jection is active and its correct functioning
must be ensured.

Diagnosis of fuel system
Faults in the fuel system (e.g., defective fuel
valve, leaks in the intake manifold) can
 prevent the optimum mixture form being
formed. For this reason, the OBD needs to
monitor the system. The ECU therefore
processes data such as the intake air mass
(air-mass-sensor signal), the throttle-valve
position, the air/fuel ratio (primary lambda-
sensor signal) and engine operating data.
This data is then compared with modeled
calculations.

Diagnosis of lambda sensors
The lambda-sensor system generally consists
of two sensors (upstream and downstream 
of the catalytic converter) and the lambda
closed-loop control circuit. Upstream of the
catalytic converter, there is normally a broad-
band lambda sensor. It measures the λ level
(i.e. the air/fuel mixture across the entire
range from rich to lean) continuously by
means of a variable voltage (Fig. 16a). It is
also to controls this voltage. On older sys-
tems, a two-step lambda sensor was used
 upstream of the catalytic converter. The two-
step sensor indicates only whether the mix-
ture is lean (λ > 1) or rich (λ < 1) by an
abrupt change in the voltage signal (Fig. 16b).
Present-day concepts incorporate a sec-
ondary lambda sensor – generally a two-step
sensor – downstream of the primary catalytic
converter and/or the main converter. It
serves firstly to fine-tune the primary lambda
sensor and secondly, for OBD functions. 
The lambda sensors not only measure the
air/fuel mixture in the exhaust gas for the en-
gine-management system, they also monitor
the function of the catalytic converter(s). 

Possible lambda-sensor faults include:
(cid:2) Breaks or short circuits in the electrical

circuit 

(cid:2) Aging (thermal, poisoning) of the sensor
(leads to diminished sensor-signal dy-
namics)

(cid:2) Corrupted signals caused by the sensor
failing to reach operating temperature

Primary sensor
The sensor upstream of the catalytic con-
verter is referred to as the primary or up-
stream sensor. It is checked for: 
(cid:2) Plausibility (internal resistance, output
voltage – the actual signal – and other
 parameters), and

(cid:2) Dynamic response (rate of signal change
at changeover from “rich” to “lean” and
from “lean” to “rich”, and period dura-
tion)

If the sensor has a heater, the heater function
must also be checked. The tests are carried
out while the vehicle is in motion at rela-
tively constant operating conditions.

The broad-band lambda sensor requires

different diagnostic procedures from the
two-step sensor since it can also record
 levels other than λ = 1. 

Secondary sensor
The secondary or downstream sensor(s)
is/are used to monitor the catalytic converter
as well as for other functions. They check
the conversion efficiency of the catalytic
converter and supply the most important
data for converter diagnosis. The secondary-
sensor signals can also be used to check the
data provided by the primary sensor. In ad-
dition, the secondary sensor can help to
 ensure the long-term stability of emission
levels by correcting the primary-sensor
 signals.

Apart from the period duration, all of 
the characteristics and parameters listed for
the primary sensor are also checked for the
secondary sensor.

Diagnosis of exhaust-gas recirculation
 system
The exhaust-gas recirculation system is an
effective means of reducing the emissions of
nitrogen oxides. Adding recirculated exhaust
gas to the air/fuel mixture entering the en-
gine lowers the peak combustion tempera-
ture. In turn, this reduces the formation of
nitrogen oxides. The functional efficiency of

the exhaust-gas recirculation system there-
fore has to be monitored. There are two
 alternative methods that may be used. 

The method based on intake-manifold
pressure involves closing the exhaust-gas re-
circulation valve briefly while the engine is
operating at medium power, and measuring
the pressure change. A comparison between
the measured intake-manifold pressure and
the pressure calculated using a model allows
diagnosis of the closing function of the ex-
haust-gas recirculation valve.

The method based on uneven engine
 running is used in systems without an air-
mass sensor or without an additional intake-
manifold pressure sensor. The exhaust-gas
recirculation valve is slightly opened while
the engine is idling. If the exhaust-gas recir-
culation system is functioning correctly, 
the slight increase in residual-gas mass
causes the engine to run slightly more un-
evenly. This is used by the engine-smooth-
ness monitoring function to diagnose ex-
haust-gas recirculation valve problems.

Diagnosis of crankcase ventilation
The so-called “blow-by gas” which enters the
crankcase by escaping past the pistons, pis-
ton rings and cylinders has to be removed
from the crankcase. This is the function of
the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV)
system. The exhaust-gas enriched air has the
soot removed from it by a cyclone separator
and is then passed through the PCV valve
into the intake manifold so that hydrocar-
bons can be returned to the combustion
 cycle.

One possible diagnosis method is based
on measuring the idle speed which, when
the PCV valve is opened, should exhibit spe-
cific characteristics that are predicted by 
a model. If the observed change in the idle
speed differs too greatly from the modeled
response, a leak is assumed to exist.

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Diagnosis of engine cooling system
The engine cooling system consists of a large
and a small circulation system which are con-
nected by a thermostatic valve. The small cir-
culation system is used during the starting
phase to bring the engine quickly to operat-
ing temperature and is brought into action
by closing the thermostatic valve. If the ther-
mostat is defective or it has seized in the open
position, the rate of coolant temperature rise
is slowed down – particularly in cold weather
conditions – and this results in higher emis-
sion levels. A thermostat monitoring func-
tion should therefore detect a slow rate of
coolant temperature increase. The system’s
temperature sensor is first tested. Then the
thermostatic valve is checked on this basis.

Diagnosis for monitoring heating measures
In order to obtain a high conversion rate,
the catalytic converter needs to operate at 
a temperature of 400...800 °C. However,
higher temperatures can damage the con-
verter coating. 

A catalytic converter operating at opti-
mum temperature reduces engine emissions
by more than 99 %. At low temperatures, 
its efficiency diminishes to the extent that 
a cold catalytic converter is almost totally
 ineffective. Therefore, in order to be able to
meet emission-control requirements, a spe-
cial strategy is required to bring the catalytic
converter up to operating temperature as
quickly as possible. The special converter-
heating phase is terminated when the con-
verter reaches a temperature of 200...250 °C
(light-off temperature, approx. 50 % conver-
sion efficiency). From this point on, the cat-
alytic converter heats itself by exothermic
conversion reactions. 

When the engine is first started, two
methods can be employed to heat up the
catalytic converter more quickly:
(cid:2) The ignition can be retarded to increase

the exhaust-gas temperature

(cid:2) The catalytic reactions produced in the
catalytic converter by the incompletely
burnt fuel in the exhaust manifold cause
the converter to generate heat itself

The consequence of these effects is that the
catalytic converter reaches its operating tem-
perature more quickly so that exhaust-gas
emissions are more rapidly reduced. 

In order to ensure proper converter func-
tion, legislation requires monitoring of the
temperature immediately upstream of the
catalytic converter and monitoring of the
converter warm-up phase. The warm-up
phase can be monitored by checking and 
analyzing parameters such as ignition angle,
engine speed and intake-air mass. In addi-
tion, other factors related to catalytic-con-
verter warm-up are also specifically moni-
tored during this phase (e.g., camshaft posi-
tion/lock). 

Air conditioner (components)
In order to cover the power requirements 
of the air conditioner, the engine is run in 
a different mode when given different re-
quirements apply. If the optimized operating
mode is not activated when the air condi-
tioner is switched on (or if it is activated
when the air conditioner is switched off),
higher exhaust-gas emissions can result,
which means that the function has to be
monitored.

Diagnosis of variable valve timing (VVT)
Variable valve timing is used under certain
conditions to reduce fuel consumption and
exhaust-gas emissions. Whereas previously
VVT was indirectly subject to legislative
 requirements as a “comprehensive compo-
nent”, the OBD II Update introduces explicit
demands. Present diagnosis involves mea-
suring the camshaft position and perform-
ing a setpoint/actual-value comparison.

Direct ozone-reduction system
A particular feature of the Californian emis-
sion-control legislation is the possibility of
reducing not only exhaust gases and evapo-
rative-loss emissions, but also the atmos-
pheric concentration of the air pollutant,
ozone. This is the purpose of the catalytic
coating applied to the vehicle radiator to
create a Direct Ozone Reduction (DOR)

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

 system. Ozone reduction is calculated on the
basis of the surface area and the air through-
put. A “credit” amount is then calculated.
This can then be taken into account when
calculating the total reduction of exhaust
gases and evaporative-loss emissions (hy-
drocarbons only). The coated radiator is
therefore an emission-reducing component
and will have to be monitored by the OBD
system with effect from model year 2006
 (legal requirement under OBD II). 

As yet, no cost-efficient testing method has
become widespread. The possible methods
of diagnosis currently under discussion are
listed below.
(cid:2) Pressure sensor: Contamination reduces

the amount of ozone passing through the
radiator. A pressure sensor can detect the
resulting drop in pressure. 

(cid:2) Measurement of resistance: The coating has
a specific electrical resistance. Corrosion
of the coating changes this resistance.
(cid:2) Photodetectors: The catalytic coating is im-
permeable to light. Detectors can identify
if there are gaps in the coating.

(cid:2) Ozone sensors: These are used to measure
the ozone concentration levels in front of
and behind the radiator.

Comprehensive components: 
diagnosis of sensors
In addition to the specific diagnoses de-
scribed above, which are explicitly required
by Californian legislation and described in-
dividually in separate sections, all sensors
and actuators (e.g., throttle valve or high-
pressure pump) must also be monitored, 
as faults in these components could affect
emission levels or prevent other diagnostic
functions. 

Sensors have to be monitored for: 

(cid:2) Electrical faults 
(cid:2) Range errors and – where possible – 
(cid:2) Plausibility errors

Electrical faults
The legislation defines electrical faults as
short circuits to ground, power-supply short
circuits or circuit breaks. 

Checking for range errors (“range checks”)
Normally, sensors have a specified output
characteristic, often with a lower and an up-
per limit, i.e., the physical detection range 
of the sensor is mapped to an output voltage
in the range of 0.5...4.5 V, for example. If the
output voltage produced by the sensor is
outside this range, a range error is present.
This means that the limits for this test (the
“range check”) are fixed limits specific to
each sensor that are not dependent on the
momentary operating status of the engine. 
Where certain types of sensor do not per-

mit a distinction between electrical faults
and range errors, the legislation allows for
this.

Plausibility errors (“rationality checks”)
As a means of achieving greater diagnosis
sensitivity, the legislation demands that
plausibility checks (so-called “rationality
checks”) be carried out in addition to the
range checks. The characteristic feature of
such plausibility checks is that the momen-
tary sensor output voltage is not – as is the
case with the range checks – compared with
fixed limits but with narrower limits that 
are determined by the momentary operating
status of the engine. This means that for 
this check current data from the engine-
management system must be referred to.
These checks may be implemented as com-
parisons between the sensor output voltage
and a model by cross-reference with another
sensor. The model defines an expected range
for the modeled variable for all engine oper-
ating conditions.

In order to make repairs as straightfor-
ward and effective as possible, the defective
component has to be identified as accurately
as possible. In addition, the categories of
fault referred to should be distinguishable
from one another and – in the case of range

322

Diagnosis

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

and plausibility errors – as to whether the
signal is outside the upper or lower limit. 
In the case of electrical faults, the problem
can generally be assumed to be a wiring
fault, whereas a plausibility error rather
tends to indicate a fault in the component
 itself.

As testing for electrical faults and range

errors must be continuous, checking for
plausibility errors must take place at a speci-
fied minimum frequency during normal
 operation.

Among the sensors to be monitored in

this way are the following:
(cid:2) The air-mass sensor
(cid:2) Various pressure sensors (intake manifold,

atmospheric pressure, fuel tank) 

(cid:2) The engine-speed sensor
(cid:2) The phase sensor
(cid:2) The intake-air temperature sensor
(cid:2) The exhaust-gas temperature sensor

Example
The diagnostic process is described below
using the air-mass sensor as an example.

The air-mass sensor, which is used to de-
tect the amount of air drawn in by the en-
gine to enable calculation of the amount of
fuel to be injected, measures the air-mass
rate and sends that information to the
Motronic system in the form of an output
voltage signal. The air masses vary according
to the throttle setting and/or engine speed. 

The diagnostic function monitors

whether the sensor output voltage is outside
certain (specifiable, fixed) upper and lower
limits, and if they output a range error. 

By comparing the air mass indicated by
the air-mass sensor with the current posi-
tion of the throttle valve – taking account of
the engine operating status – the sensor sig-
nal can be taken to be implausible if the di-
vergence between the two signals is greater
that a certain tolerance. Example: The throt-
tle valve is fully open but the air-mass sensor
indicates the contradiction of air mass
equivalent to idle speed.

Comprehensive components: 
diagnosis of actuators
Actuators have to be monitored for electrical
faults and – if technically possible – for cor-
rect function. Function monitoring in this
case means that the execution of a given
 actuation command is monitored by ob -
serving whether the system responds in the
 appropriate manner. This means that –
compared with sensor-signal plausibility
checking – additional information has to 
be obtained from the system in order to 
assess component function.

Actuators include the following: 
(cid:2) All output stages 
(cid:2) The throttle valve 
(cid:2) The electronic throttle control system 
(cid:2) The canister-purge valve, and 
(cid:2) The carbon-canister shutoff valve 

However, the majority of these components
are already taken into account in the system
diagnoses.

Example
The throttle valve is responsible for control-
ling the amount of air that mixes with each
injection of fuel. In the electronic throttle
control system, it is electronically controlled.
The throttle-valve angle (aperture) for ad-
justing the rate of air intake is controlled by
a digital position controller. In order to di-
agnose throttle-valve faults, the controller 
is monitored for discrepancies between the
specified and the actual throttle-valve angle.
If the divergence is too great, a throttle-valve
positioner fault is registered. The same fault
is recorded if the throttle-valve positioner
response is too small. 

With the electronic throttle control sys-
tem, there is no longer a mechanical link be-
tween the accelerator pedal and the throttle
valve. Instead, the throttle setting desired by
the driver and indicated by the position of
the accelerator pedal is detected by two
identical potentiometers (for verification)
and processed by the engine ECU.

Global service

“When you ride in a motorcar you will dis-
cover that horses are really incredibly bor-
ing (. . .). But the car needs a conscientious
mechanic (. . .).”

Robert Bosch wrote these lines to his
friend Paul Reusch in 1906. In those days it
was indeed possible for the hired chauffeur or
mechanic to repair problems. Later on, how-
ever, in the period following the First World
War, rising numbers of motorists driving their
own vehicles led to a corresponding increase
in the demand for service facilities. In the

1920’s Robert Bosch launched a campaign
aimed at creating a comprehensive service
 organisation. Within Germany these service
centres received the uniform designation
“Bosch-Dienst” in 1926

Today’s Bosch operations bear the name
“Bosch Car Service”. They feature state-of-
the-art electronic service equipment to meet
the demands defined by the automotive tech-
nology and the customer expectations of
 today.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis in the workshop

The function of this diagnosis is to identify
the smallest, defective, replaceable unit
quickly and reliably. The prompted trou-
bleshooting procedure includes on-board
information and off-board test procedures
and testers. Help is provided, for example,
by Electronic Service Information
(ESI[tronic]) from Bosch. It contains
 instructions for further troubleshooting 
for many possible problems (e.g., engine
bucks) and faults (e.g., short circuit in
 engine-temperature sensor).

Prompted troubleshooting
The main element is the prompted trou-
bleshooting procedure. The workshop em-
ployee is prompted by means of a symptom-
dependent, event-controlled procedure –
starting from the symptom (vehicle symp-
tom or fault-memory entry). On-board
(fault-memory entry) and off-board facili-
ties (actuator diagnosis and on-board
testers) are used.

Prompted troubleshooting, fault-memory

readouts, workshop diagnostic functions,
and electrical communication with off-
board testers take place using PC-based
 diagnostic testers. This may be a specific
workshop tester from the vehicle manufac-
turer or a universal tester (e.g., KTS 650
from Bosch). 

Reading out fault-memory entries
Fault information (fault-memory entries)
stored during vehicle operation are read out
via a serial interface during vehicle service or
repair in the service workshop.

Fault entries are read out using a diagnos-

tic tester. The workshop employee receives
information about:
(cid:2) Malfunctions (e.g., engine-temperature

sensor)

(cid:2) Fault codes (e.g., short circuit to ground,

implausible signal, static fault)

(cid:2) Ambient conditions (measured values on
fault storage, e.g. engine speed, engine
temperature, etc.)

Once the fault information has been re-
trieved in the workshop and the fault cor-
rected, the fault memory can be cleared
again using the tester. 

A suitable interface must be defined for
communication between the ECU and the
tester.

Actuator diagnosis
The ECU contains an actuator diagnostic
routine in order to activate individual actua-
tors at the service workshop and test their
functionality. This test mode is started using
the diagnostic tester and only functions
when the vehicle is at standstill below a
 specific engine speed, or when the engine 
is switched off. This allows an acoustic (e.g.,
valve clicking), visual (e.g., flap movement),
or other type of inspection, e.g., measure-
ment of electrical signals, to test actuator
function.

Workshop diagnostic functions
Faults that the on-board diagnosis fails 
to detect can be localized using support
functions. These diagnostic functions are
implemented in the engine ECU and are
controlled by the diagnostic tester.

Workshop diagnostic functions run auto-
matically, either after they are started by the
diagnostic tester, or they report back to the
diagnostic tester at the end of the test, or the
diagnostic tester assumes runtime control,
measured data acquisition, and data evalua-
tion. The ECU then executes individual
commands only.

Signal testing
Electrical current, voltage and resistance can
be measured with the diagnostic tester’s
multimeter function. In addition, an inte-
grated oscilloscope allows the signal paths 
of the actuating signals for the actuators 
to be checked. This is especially relevant to
actuators that are not checked in the actua-
tor-diagnosis process. 

Off-board tester
The diagnostic capabilities are expanded by
using additional sensors, test equipment,
and external . In the event of a fault detected
in the workshop, off-board testers are
adapted to the vehicle.

ECU development

Hardware development

ECU development

The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is the
central point from which an electronic
 system in the motor vehicle is controlled.
High demands in terms of quality and relia-
bility are therefore made of ECU develop-
ment.

The tender specification contains the vehicle
manufacturer’s individual specifications and
requirements. The performance specifica-
tion is derived from the tender specification.
This is the standard document for ECU de-
velopment, which is made up of the individ-
ual fields of hardware development, func-
tion development, software development
and application engineering.

Hardware development

The complexity of electronic systems has
consistently increased over the years, and
this trend is to continue in the future. On -
going development can only be effectively
managed by using highly integrated circuits.
The demand for small dimensions in all
 system components in turn places ever 
more exacting demands on hardware
 development.

Efficient and economical development 
of hardware can only be achieved through
the use of standard modules which are
 produced in large quantities. 

Hardware specimens
After the project start, hardware specimens
are built and subjected to quality inspec-
tions. The specimens can be assigned as
 preliminary stages of the series-production
ECU to four categories. Each specimen cate-
gory builds on the preceding category and 
is suitable for the intended purpose in each
case.

A-specimen
The A-specimen is built from an existing, 
if necessary modified ECU or a development
printed-circuit board. Its functional scope 
is limited. Its technical function is to a large
extent guaranteed; however, the A-specimen
is not suitable for endurance testing. It is a
function specimen which is used for prelimi-
nary tests and serves to verify the design.

B-specimen
The B-specimen contains all the circuit
components. It is a test specimen, with which
the entire functional scope and technical
 requirements are tested in preliminary test.
It is already suitable for endurance testing 
in motor-vehicle prototypes. 

The connection and installation dimen-
sions correspond to series status. However, 
it is possible that not all the vehicle manu-
facturer’s specifications have been fulfilled,
because, for example, other materials have
been used.

Project start
All the functions which the ECU to be devel-
oped must fulfill are described in a block
 diagram. From this diagram, the following
points can be clarified:
(cid:2) Determination of the scope for the

 hardware

(cid:2) Cost estimate for the hardware
(cid:2) Development expenditure, and
(cid:2) Tool costs

C-specimen
The C-specimen is the release specimen, with
which the vehicle manufacturer’s tests are
carried out for “Technical Release”. All the
specifications are safely fulfilled with this
ECU. The product release concludes the 
development phase. Where possible, the 
C-specimens are manufactured with stan-
dard tools and manufacturing processes
closely approximating full-scale production.

DOI 10.1007/978-3-658-03964-6_22, © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2015 

D-specimen
The D-specimen is the pilot-series specimen,
on which the series type plate showing the
release number is incorporated. Pilot-series
vehicles are equipped with D-specimens 
for large-scale vehicle production trials.
These ECUs are assembled and tested with
standard manufacturing processes and un-
der series conditions. With these specimens,
confirmation of manufacturing safety and
reliability is provided.

Preparations
The preparations for the B-specimen begin
at the project start:
(cid:2) Determination of connector-pin assign-

ment

(cid:2) Determination of the housing
(cid:2) Order and development for new circuit

modules (function groups)

(cid:2) Drawing up of the circuit diagram
(cid:2) Determination of the components (only
released components may be provided, 
or they must still be released)

When the circuit modules are selected (e.g.,
in an IC-integrated evaluation circuit for
knock sensors), checks are made to ascertain
whether already existing circuits – if neces-
sary with modifications – can be used.
 Otherwise, new modules must be developed.

Circuit diagram and bill of materials
The circuit diagram (Fig. 1 a) complete with
a bill of materials of the components used 
is created with a CAD system (Computer
Aided Design). In the bill of materials, the
following points are also established for each
component:
(cid:2) Component size
(cid:2) Pin assignment
(cid:2) Geometry in the layout
(cid:2) Housing, and
(cid:2) Supplier and terms of delivery

Specimen assembly
The components must be inserted on the
finished printed-circuit board (Fig. 1d). 
This is done in the case of specimen ECUs 
in specimen construction. Because of the
miniaturization of the components and the
high integration density on the printed-cir-
cuit board, it is essential that the compo-
nents can be inserted even on the specimen
units with an automatic insertion machine.
The machine is controlled by the layout’s
CAD data. 

The components are soldered after being
 inserted. Two methods are available:
(cid:2) Wave soldering, or
(cid:2) Reflow soldering

Testing the equipped printed-circuit
board
Electrical testing
The equipped and soldered printed-circuit
board must be tested. Electrical test rou-
tines, which run on a computer, are drawn
up for this purpose. This automatic test
checks the completeness of the equipped
components and the functional capability 
of the circuit.

Layout
A layout (Fig. 1b) is required for printed-
 circuit board production. This reflects the
printed conductors and the connector pins
of the components. 

The layout is created on a CAD system. 
The circuit-diagram data are adopted and
converted. The network list now created
(connection list of the components) pro-
vides information on how the components
are interconnected. The layout can be cre-
ated from this network list and from the
CAD data for the components (component
size and pin assignment). 

The creation of the layout is subject to
 requirements, which must be taken into
 account. In terms of the positioning of
 components, these requirements may be 
as follows:
(cid:2) The power loss created in components

(possibility of heat dissipation)
(cid:2) EMC influences (Electro-Magnetic

 Compatibility)

(cid:2) Favorable arrangement of the compo-
nents in relation to the connector

(cid:2) Observance of blocked areas (component

(cid:2) Insertability by automatic component

size)

machines

(cid:2) Test points, and
(cid:2) Space required for test adapters and visual

inspection systems

Printed-circuit board
Films for printed-circuit-board production
(Fig. 1c) can be made with the layout data.
These films are used to expose, develop and
etch the “raw” printed-circuit board’s pro-
vided with a photosensitve layer. The indi-
vidual layers of the multilayer printed-cir-
cuit board are laid one on top of the other
and hardened.

Then a solder resist mask and a carbon
 lacquer are applied to the printed-circuit
board.

Thermography
Thermographic pictures of the printed- circuit
board show the buildup of heat by the com-
ponents during operation (Fig. 2). The differ-
ent temperature ranges are shown on the film
in different colors. It is therefore possible to
identify components which  become too hot.
The findings made here  influence the change
list from the B- to the C-specimen. Layout
changes (e.g., heat through hole plating) can
be used to reduce the buildup of heat.

Electromagnetic testing
The electromagnetic fields generated on the
printed-circuit board can be sampled with 
a magnetic-field probe (Fig. 1e). The results
are then evaluated on a PC. Different field
strengths are identified by different colors. 
If necessary, layout changes must be made 
and additional components provided which
prevent electromagnetic fields from being
 radiated.

These tests are also carried out as early as on
the B-specimen so that the necessary changes
can be taken into account in the C-specimen.

3

Vehicle in an EMC test chamber

EMC tests
Tests conducted in an EMC test cell or EMC
test chamber (Fig. 3) check the behavior of
the ECU for electromagnetic irradiation and
radiation. Tests are performed both on the
installed ECU (vehicle tests) and in the labo-
ratory (e.g., stripline procedure). 

On the negative side, vehicle tests can only 
be carried out when the vehicle and the elec-
tronics are already at an advanced stage of
development. The possibilities for interven-
tion in the event of unsatisfactory EMC be-
havior are therefore extremely limited at this
stage. For this reason, early laboratory tests
are very important, because these allows
tests at an early stage with the hardware
specimens. 

The EMC tests are carried out at different
frequencies and different electrical field
strengths. The output signals (e.g., ignition
signals, injection signals) are analyzed to as-
certain their immunity to interference from
irradiation and their radiation behavior.

Function development

Function development

Highly exacting demands regarding driver
convenience and fuel consumption are placed
on modern motor-vehicle engines. 
In order that these demands can be met eco-
nomically at the same time as compliance
with increasingly strict emission-control
 legislation, the prime requirement is for
 optimized coordination between the engine
management system and the entire drivetrain,
numerous sensors and actuators and the
fault-diagnosis functions for them.

As, in contrast with earlier solutions, direct
mechanical adjustment of the actuators in re-
sponse to changes in ambient conditions is
not possible, the engine electronic control
unit– and therefore the control software run-
ning on it – is the only link between the sen-
sors and the actuators. Consequently, the fuel
consumption characteristics of a  vehicle are
determined to a great extent by the algo-
rithms implemented on the engine-manage-
ment system and the quality of them.

It is the purpose of function development

to provide these algorithms. 

Requirements placed on functions
Modularity
Modern control systems have to be modular
in terms of the structure of their functions
and hardware in order to manage the enor-
mous variety of engine-configuration para-
meters, such as number of cylinders, fuel-
 injection method, sensors used and type of
exhaust-gas system. A hierarchical structure
divided into subsystems (air system, fuel sys-
tem, exhaust-gas system) with stable inter-
faces enables parallel and therefore rapid de-
velopment which, at the rate of innovation in
today’s automotive industry, is becoming an
increasingly important consideration.

Component packages
For every class of sensors and actuators, a
generally applicable interface with a physical
representation is created. Higher-level control
functions connect to this interface without
knowledge of the way in which the compo-
nent is structured and leave the detailed han-
dling of special component properties to the
lower function level, the so-called component
package. The latter provides for optimum in-
teraction between the mechanical component
– i.e. the sensor or actuator –, the processing
or control hardware and the hardware-related
software. In addition to essential functions
such as protection against excessive tempera-
tures or operating voltages, this is also where
the correction of nonlinear characteristics
and conversion into the selected physically
based component-package interface format
take place. It means, for  example, that the
changeover from a pneumatic to an electric
actuator can be implemented without alter-
ing the higher-level control functions.

This concept is the basic requirement 

for the use of similar components of differing
generations and manufacturers, with  minor
consequences for the overall system.

Development process
Requirement
When new requirements emerge in relation
to a customer or platform project, for exam-
ple with regard to the use of new compo-
nents, a possible solution has to be found 
and the functions that are affected have to 
be identified. When doing so, the existing
function structure should be retained as far 
as possible in order that the interfaces, and
therefore the interaction with other func-
tions, are not endangered. Once the necessary
algorithms are known and capable of imple-
mentation on the ECU, an estimate is pro-
duced of the amount of development work,
the cost and the completion date.  Following
discussions with internal and external clients,
the project is commissioned by the customer
and a definite delivery deadline agreed.

Concept
If the available algorithms are inadequate for
performing the required task and if the task is
sufficiently significant, a new development
process is initiated involving basic calibration
and testing on the vehicle or engine test
bench. The resulting concept is tested for
conformity with physical principles, absence
of conflicts, capability of implementation 
in the available engine-management system
and anticipated applicability in the process 
of a concept review involving representatives
from Function Development, System Devel-
opment and Application.

Function definition
There then follows the implementation of the
concept by the creation and specification 
of each function. After offline simulation of
critical components using measured vehicle
data, these functions are entered as function
definitions in a central database together with
the associated documentation which encom-
passes the written descriptions and applica-
tion instructions.

Function reviews with other function
 developers prevent the repetition of known
errors.

Encoding
Next, the software developers convert the
functions into program code either by auto-
matic code generation or manually in the case
of critical functions. As with function re-
views, a code review minimizes error
 frequency.

Function test
On completion, all new software modules are
integrated in a program version for a specific
vehicle project. Only then can the system be
tested under real conditions on the vehicle.
This test involves three stages:
(cid:2) The function developer checks that the

specifications and the software implemen-
tation are consistent with one another
(cid:2) The function developer compares the im-
plemented solution with the customer/
project requirements

(cid:2) In the course of initial commissioning,
Function Development and Application
jointly assess whether the chosen solution
is adequately applicable and also usable for
other projects

These tests can lead to more or less extensive 
modifications to the selected solution. How-
ever, the aim is always to identify errors as
early as possible in the development process
in order to manage their impact on deadlines,
costs and quality within acceptable limits.

Program version delivery
After the testing stage, the functions are deliv-
ered to the customer in the form of a pro-
gram version. In the case of new concepts or
extensive modifications, the function devel-
oper and the Application department assist
the customer with commissioning by present-
ing the selected concept and discussing the
calibration procedure on the engine test
bench or in the course of summer or winter
trials.

Software development

From Assembler . . .
When the first microcontrollers were used 
in control units, the programs they used re-
quired only 4 kilobytes of space or even less.
At that time, it was all the memory that was
available. For this reason, the programs had
to be written in a space-saving language. 
The most commonly used programming lan-
guage was Assembler. The commands in this
language are mnemonics. They generally cor-
respond directly to the instructions in the 
microcontroller’s machine code. However,
Assembler programs are generally difficult to
read and maintain.

Over the course of time, the capacity of
memory chips grew larger and larger, and the
range of functions performed by the engine-
management system became more and more
complex. The expanding variety of functions
made software modularization unavoidable.
The ECU program is divided into modules,
each of which incorporates a specific group of
functions (e.g. lambda closed-loop control,
idle-speed control). Of course, these modules
have to be usable not just for one particular
project but for large numbers of similar pro-
jects. For this reason, defined interfaces for
the input and output variables of the func-
tions are important. At this point, assembly
language is reaching the limits of its capabili-
ties.

. . . to high-level programming language
For the demands faced by present-day soft-
ware developers, high-level programming
languages are indispensable. The entire soft-
ware for an engine-management system is
nowadays written in a high-level language –
the preferred choice being the C program-
ming language. Programming in a high-level
language ensures: 
(cid:2) Updatability of the software
(cid:2) Modularity
(cid:2) Interchangeability of software packages
(cid:2) Independence of the software from the 
microcontroller used in the control unit

Software quality
Most innovations in automotive technology
today are based on the use of electronics. 
In the past, the software was seen as an
 “appendage” to the hardware. Over time, 
however, the importance of the software has
steadily grown. With the increasing complex-
ity of microcontroller-controlled electronic
systems, the quality of the software became 
a central pillar of software development –
 because problems caused by imperfections 
in the software damage the image of a manu-
facturer and drive up warranty-claim costs.

Software process improvement
The model used for improving processes in
software development is CMM (Capability
Maturity Model). It provides a framework 
for highlighting the elements of an effective
software-development process. It describes 
an evolutionary path from a disorganized 
to a perfected, disciplined process and
 supports:
(cid:2) Characterization of the degree of process

maturity

ment and

(cid:2) Definition of targets for process improve-

(cid:2) Setting of priorities for action to be taken

Distributed development
Bosch develops software not only in Germany
but at a number of locations around the
world. The same development process is ap-
plied throughout this international develop-
ment network. Consequently, the same high
standards of software quality are produced by
Bosch worldwide.

Software sharing
As a result of software modularization and
the use of defined interfaces, “external” soft-
ware modules can also be incorporated in 
the ECU programs. This means that a vehicle
manufacturer can use its own software for
different vehicle models. The software then
becomes a “distinguishing factor” on the
competitive marketplace.

ECU development

Software development

333

Linker
Once all the modules that make up the
 overall program have been created and com-
piled, all the object-code modules can be
combined to form an executable program.
This job is performed by a linker. The linker
makes use of a file in which all the modules 
to be linked are listed. The file also details the
memory addresses for the data and program
memories. So all the relative addresses quoted
in the object-code modules can be replaced
by absolute addresses.

The result of the linking process is a ma-
chine-code program capable of running on
the target system – the electronic control
unit.

Module archiving
Software is subject to a rapid process of
change. So that program versions supplied 
to customers can be reliably reproduced, it is
essential to archive the modules. Archiving
programs allow the tracking of every modifi-
cation down to each individual module. 
For each archived program version, all the
modules used can be listed and retrieved.

Testing station
The program code produced by the linker has
to be tested in the laboratory before the ECU
programmed with this code can be used on a
vehicle. First of all, the new modules have to
be individually tested in every detail. After
this, the ability of all the modules to operate
perfectly in combination with one another
has to be thoroughly tested. 

The tests are carried out on a testing sta-
tion which is made up of a diverse range of
testing equipment (Fig. 2 overleaf).

Creating program code
The basis for software development are the
function definitions that are produced by the
function developers. These documents de-
scribe the ECU functions (e.g. lambda closed-
loop control) that are to be converted into a
program by the software developers and then
combined into an executable ECU program.

Creating source code
For every function, a separate module – a
component of the overall program – is pro-
duced. The source code for the modules is
written on a PC using a text editor (Fig. 1).
The source code essentially contains the
 actual program instructions as well as docu-
mentation that facilitates the “readability” 
of the program (for program upgrading).

Compiler
Once created, the source code has to be trans-
lated into machine code so that it can be un-
derstood by the microcontroller. This involves
the use of a compiler. It produces “object
code” which contains relative rather than 
absolute memory addresses.

ECU development

Software development

ECU with emulator module
A specially constructed laboratory version of
the ECU is used for laboratory tests. It differs
from the production version by virtue of 
an IC socket in place of the permanently sol-
dered Flash-EPROM. Plugged into this socket
is an emulator module which simulates the
EPROM by means of a RAM. 
This makes it possible to modify data and
program code “online”. The control opera-
tions are performed on a PC.

LabCar
In a real operating environment, the control
unit receives input signals from sensors and
desired-value generators. It then produces
output signals to control the physical actua-
tors on the vehicle. The sensor signals are
simulated in a laboratory environment. 
The necessary signal generators (e.g. in -
ductive speed sensor) or hardware circuits
(e.g. resistor sequence for simulating the 
temperature sensor) are accommodated 
in a “black box” known as the LabCar.

The LabCar also emulates the connections
with all of the actuators controlled by the
control unit. One of the most important 
is the electronic throttle-valve device since
feedback from this device is continuously
monitored by the ECU. Without the throttle-
valve link, it is not possible to operate the 
vehicle.

The immobilizer also has to be connected
to the ECU in order to allow vehicle opera-
tion. The electrical signals are simulated.

The LabCar thus provides the means for
simulating the vehicle for the purposes of
testing the ECU program.

Connection adaptor
In the wiring harness which connects the 
LabCar to the ECU, there is a connection
adaptor. Every lead in the wiring harness 
is plugged into a socket on the connection
adaptor. This means this every signal travel-
ing to or from the control unit is accessible
for testing purposes (e.g. tracking the voltage
curve of a control signal using an oscillo-
scope).

Emulator mode
The control unit (with microcontroller
socket) has an emulator plugged into it. 
The emulator replaces the ECU’s microcon-
troller. The ECU program then runs on the
emulator. 

The program code is loaded to the emula-

tor from a PC. The emulator is also con-
trolled from this PC. This means that:
(cid:2) The program can be started from a specific

memory address

(cid:2) “Breakpoints” can be set (so this the
 program stops at defined points)

(cid:2) The program sequence can be retraced
from the breakpoint and the memory 
contents can be read and modified at 
each individual stage

(cid:2) Trigger conditions can be defined and the
program sequence can be analyzed before
and after the trigger point

(cid:2) Internal signals and registers (processor
registers) that otherwise would not be
 accessible can be read

(cid:2) In single-step mode, program sequences

can be processed one step at a time and the
processing sequence tracked

(cid:2) Data and program code can be modified in
order to manipulate the program sequence
for testing purposes

The ability to set trigger conditions and
record results makes it possible to analyze the
program run in relation to specific input sig-
nals. As a result, every branch of the program
can be tested against the function  definitions.

Logic analyzer
Another means of tracking the program
 sequence is provided by the logic analyzer. 
It is connected via an adaptor in such a way
that it can “listen in” to data traffic on the ad-
dress and data buses. In this way, it can record
the program sequence and also track read-
and-write access to the external data memory.
However, access to the data memory inte-
grated in the microcontroller is not possible.

Trigger conditions (e.g. reaching a specific ad-
dress, storage of a specific value in a memory
cell) can be set on the logic analyzer. When
the trigger condition has been met, the pro-
gram sequence can be retraced.

The emulator and the logic analyzer offer
similar capabilities. The advantage of the
logic analyzer is that it does not interfere with
the program sequence (real time) and can
therefore be used in a real operating
 environment on the vehicle.

Automatic test
The LabCar testing station not only provides
the means for manual testing of ECU pro-
grams, it also offers the facility for substan-
tially reducing testing times, particularly
where repeat tests are concerned, by using an
automatic testing sequence. For such pur-
poses, the ECU is operated in a closed-loop
control circuit. At present, there are four dif-
ferent tests that can be used:
1. The most frequently used plausibility test is
a “rough check” of the most important
ECU functions. It performs an electrical
and physical check on all input variables,
and tests fuel injection and ignition, throt-
tle-valve response, and maximum runtime
load on the ECU.

2. The OBD (On-Board Diagnosis) test

checks out the most important ECU diag-
nostic functions and fault management 
by means of fault simulation.

3. The CAN test checks communication sig-
nals with reference to range of values and
reference signal.

4. The start/stop test analyzes fuel-injection
and ignition response to ECU start-and-
stop processes. Among other things, this
involves varying the battery voltage.

336

ECU development

Application-related adaptation

Parameter definition
The next stage involves adapting the elec-
tronic control system – the Motronic – to
the engine. This is the function of applica-
tion-specific adaptation. Application-spe-
cific adaptation means adapting an engine
to suit a particular vehicle.

The ECU program consists of the program
itself plus a large amount of data. The pro-
gram meets the requirements set out in the
specifications document (function frame-
work), but the data still has to be adapted 
to the particular engine and vehicle-model
variant.

In the adaptation phase, all data – also re-
ferred to as parameters – has to be adjusted
to achieve optimum efficiency of operation.
The main evaluation criteria include:
(cid:2) Low-emission exhaust gas (compliance
with prevailing emission standards)

(cid:2) High torque and power output
(cid:2) Low fuel consumption and
(cid:2) High level of user-friendliness

Application-related
 adaptation

So that a car is able to meet the driver’s
 expectations, extensive development work is
required, particularly in respect of the  engine. 
As a rule, the vehicle manufacturer will

center the development of a new vehicle
around a basic engine. The most important
operating parameters for this engine are
known quantities, such as:
(cid:2) Compression ratio and
(cid:2) Valve timing (on engines with variable

valve timing, this can be altered while the
engine is running)

The engine peripherals have to be modified
to meet installation space constraints. 
This applies in particular to: 
(cid:2) The air-intake system and
(cid:2) The exhaust-gas system

Other important aspects (e.g. fitting loca-
tion of knock sensors) have to be defined 
in consultation with the Application depart-
ment at Bosch.

The aim of adaptation is to ensure that the
objectives outlined above are achieved as
fully as possible, i.e. the best possible com-
promise is reached between competing
 demands. 

To this end, there is a data record with up

to 5500 “labels” that are capable of adjust-
ment. These labels are subdivided into:
(cid:2) Individual parameter values 

(e.g. temperature thresholds at 
which specific functions are activated)

(cid:2) Data curves (e.g. engine speed 

vs. temperature curve for threshold 
at which a function is activated, tempera-
ture vs. ignition-timing curve) and
(cid:2) Data maps (e.g. ignition timing as 

a function of engine load and speed)

Initially, work has to be carried out on the
 engine test bench. In this basic adaptation
phase, parameters such as the ignition-timing
map are defined. When basic adaptation has
established the foundation for the initial vehi-
cle trials, all parameters that affect engine
 response and dynamic characteristics are
adapted. This work is for the greater part
 performed with the engine fitted in the
 vehicle.

The scope for optimization on Motronic
systems has become so extensive and com-
plex that many of the functions are now
only possible with the aid of automated
 optimization methods and powerful tools.

Calibration tools
A large part of the adaptation work is car-
ried out using PC-based calibration tools.
Such programs allow developers to modify
the engine-management software. One such
calibration tool is the INCA (Integrated 
Calibration and Acquisition System) pro-
gram. INCA is an integrated suite of several
tools. It is made up of the following compo-
nents:
(cid:2) The Core System incorporates all mea-
surement and adjustment functions

(cid:2) The Offline Tools (standard specification)
comprise the software for analyzis of mea-
sured data and management of adjust-
ment data, and the programming tool 
for the Flash-EPROM

The ECU used for adaptation purposes has
an emulator module instead of the program
memory (EPROM) which emulates the
ECU’s EPROM and RAM. The INCA system
has access to the data in these memories.
This memory emulator represents the
most powerful ECU interface currently
available for connecting calibration tools. 

A simpler method of linking calibration
tools (laptop) to the ECU is offered by the
MAC (compact testing and calibration de-
vice). It connects via the K-line of the diag-
nosis interface or – if present – the emulator
module (Fig. 1). 

The use and function of the calibration tools
can be illustrated by the description below
of a typical calibration process (Fig. 2 over-
leaf).

338

ECU development

Application-related adaptation

Software calibration process
Defining the desired characteristics
The desired characteristics (e.g. dynamic
 response, noise output, exhaust-gas compo-
sition) are defined by the engine manufac-
turer and the (exhaust-gas emissions) legis-
lation. The aim of calibration is to alter the
characteristics of the engine to meet these
requirements. This requires testing on the
engine test bench and in the vehicle.

Preparations
Special engine ECUs with emulator modules
are used for calibration. Compared with 
the ECUs used on production models, they
allow parameters that are fixed for normal
operation to be altered. An important aspect 
of preparations is choosing and setting up
the appropriate hardware and/or software
interface.

Additional testing equipment (e.g. tem-
perature sensors, flow meters) permit de-
tecting other physical variables for special
tests using INCA hardware components
such as:
(cid:2) Thermo Scan (for measuring tempera-

tures)

(cid:2) Lambda Scan (for measuring exhaust-gas

oxygen content)

(cid:2) Baro Scan (for measuring pressures) and
(cid:2) A/D Scan (for other analog signals)

Determining and documenting the actual
system responses
The detection of specific measured data is
carried out using the INCA kernel system.
The information concerned can be displayed
on screen and analyzed in the form of nu-
merical values or graphs (Fig. 3).

The measured data can not only be
viewed after the measurements have been
taken but while measurement is still in
progress. In this way, engine response to
changes (e.g. in the exhaust-gas recirculation
rate) can be investigated. The data can also
be recorded for subsequent analyzis of tran-
sient processes (e.g. engine starting).

Identifying possibilities for manipulation
With the help of the ECU software docu-
mentation (function framework), it is possi-
ble to identify which parameters are best
suited to altering system response in the
manner desired.

Altering selected parameters 
The parameters stored in the ECU software
can be displayed as numerical values (in 
tables) or as graphs (curves) on the PC and
 altered. Each time an alteration is made,
 system response is observed.

All parameters can be altered while the 
engine is running so that the impacts are
immediately observable and measurable.
In the case of short-lived or transient
processes (e.g. engine starting), it is effec-
tively impossible to alter the parameters
while the process is in progress. In such
cases, therefore, the process has to be
recorded during the course of a test. The
measured data is saved to file and then 
the parameters that are to be altered are
identified by analyzing the recorded data. 
Further tests are performed in order 
to evaluate the success of the adjustments
made or to learn more about the process.

because several people will be involved 
in the process of engine optimization at
 different times.

Documenting the modified parameters 
The changes to the parameters are also com-
pared and documented. This is done with
the offline tool ADM (Application Data
Manager), sometimes also called CDM
 (Calibration Data Manager).

The calibration data obtained by various
technicians is compared and merged into 
a single data record.

Programming additional control units 
The new parameter settings obtained can
also be used on other engine ECUs for fur-
ther calibration. This requires reprogram-
ming of the Flash-EPROMs in the ECUs.
This is carried out using the INCA kernel
system tool PROF (Programming of 
Flash-EPROM).

Depending on the extent of the calibration
and design innovations, multiple looping of
the steps described above may take place.

paring and document-
ing system response

meter alteration. Such

passes improvements as

Application-related adaptation

Example of calibration
Exhaust-gas temperature control
The following aspects play an essential role
in operating a modern gasoline engine: 
(cid:2) Exhaust-gas emissions 
(cid:2) Fuel consumption and 
(cid:2) Thermal stresses on engine components

In order to minimize the stresses to which
the engine is subjected, a low exhaust-gas
temperature has to be aimed at (e.g. peak
temperature below 1050 °C and continuous
temperature below 970 °C). This is a partic-
ularly important consideration in the case 
of turbocharged engines because the tur-
bocharger has to be protected against
 thermal damage. 

The exhaust-gas temperature can be re-
duced by enriching the air-fuel mixture by
manipulating the optimization parameters,
for example. Unfortunately, the negative side
of enriching the mixture is that both fuel
consumption and exhaust-gas emissions
(CO and HC) are raised. This means that
the mixture need only be enriched by the
absolute minimum amount required.
Engine operation generally follows a
 dynamic pattern, which is why the exhaust-
gas temperature is subject to fluctuations.
Therefore, a physical model to take account
of heat capacities, heat transfer and response
times is required to determine exhaust-gas
temperature. Such complex models can gen-
erally only be configured with the aid of op-
timization tools. This involves performing
tests under all relevant operating conditions
in which all essential input and output vari-
ables are recorded. In the case of exhaust-gas
temperature control, the optimizer then
adapts the optimization parameters until the
modeled temperature matches the measured
temperature as closely as possible. The accu-
racy of the modeled temperature is equiva-
lent to that achieved with a temperature sen-
sor if the choice of parameters is appropriate. 
The advantages are obvious – the temper-
ature sensor, sensor wire and installation po-
sition layout can be dispensed with on the
production model. In addition, this removes

the risk of the component failing over the
life of the vehicle. It means that the fault-
 diagnosis function for the component is 
not required either.

Other adjustments 
Safety-related adaptation
As well as the functions that determine
emission levels, performance and user-
friendliness, there are also numerous safety
functions that require adaptation (e.g. re-
sponse to failure of a sensor or actuator). 
Such safety functions are primarily in-
tended to restore the vehicle to a safe operat-
ing condition for the driver and/or to ensure
the safe operation of the engine (e.g. to pre-
vent engine damage). 

Communication
The engine ECU is normally part of a net-
work of several ECUs. The exchange of data
between vehicle, transmission, and other
 systems takes place via a data bus (usually a
CAN). Correct interaction between the vari-
ous ECUs involved cannot be fully tested and
optimized until they are installed in the vehi-
cle, as the process of basic configuration on
the engine test bench usually involves only
the engine-management module on its own. 

A typical example of the interaction between
two vehicle ECUs is the process of changing
gear with an automatic transmission. The
transmission ECU sends a request via the
data bus to reduce engine torque at the opti-
mum point in the gear shifting operation.
The engine ECU then initiates actions inde-
pendently of the driver to reduce engine
torque output and thus facilitate a smooth
and judder-free gear change. The data that
result in torque reduction has to be adapted.

Electromagnetic compatibility
The large number of electronic vehicle sys-
tems and the wide use of other electronic
communications equipment (e.g. radio tele-
phones, two-way radios, GPS navigation
 systems) make it necessary to optimize the
Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) of

ECU development

jective judgement of the test driver and long
experience play an important part in such
tests. Temperature itself can easily be simu-
lated on a test bench, but using a chassis
 dynamometer to assess a vehicle’s response
when pulling away, for example, is very diffi-
cult compared to making the judgement un-
der real driving conditions. 

In addition, road tests generally involve
longer distances and several vehicles. This
enables testing of calibration parameters
across the spread of the vehicles tested and,
therefore, allows wider conclusions to be
drawn than with calibration based on a
 single test subject. 

Another essential aspect is the impact of
variations in fuel grade from one part of the
world to another. The chief effect of such
variations in fuel grade is on the engine’s
starting characteristics and warm-up phase.
Vehicle manufacturers go to great lengths to
ensure this a vehicle will run properly on all
the fuels on the market.

Cold-weather trials
Cold-weather trials cover the temperature
range from approx. 0 °C to – 30 °C. Preferred
locations for cold-weather trials are places
such as northern Sweden and Canada. The
primary function is to assess starting and
pulling away. 

During the starting sequence, every indi-
vidual combustion process is analyzed and
the appropriate parameters optimized where
necessary. Correct configuration of parame-
ters for every individual injection sequence
is a decisive factor in engine start time and
smooth increase of engine speed from
starter speed to idle speed. Even a single im-
perfect combustion process with resulting
reduced torque development during the
startup phase is perceived as a deficiency –
even by inexperienced customers.

the  engine ECU and all its connecting leads
in terms of both immunity to external inter-
ference and of emission of interference sig-
nals. A large proportion of this optimization
work is carried out during the development
of ECUs and the sensors concerned, of
course. However, the dimensioning (e.g.
length of cable runs, type of shielding) and
routing of the wiring harnesses in the actual
vehicle has a major impact on immunity 
to and creation of interference. As a result,
testing and, if necessary, optimization of 
the complete vehicle inside an EMC room 
is  absolutely essential.

Fault diagnosis
Due to legal requirements, the capabilities
demanded of fault-diagnosis systems are
very extensive. The engine ECU constantly
checks that the signals from all connected
sensors and actuators are within specified
limits. It also tests for loose contacts, short
circuits to ground or to the battery terminal,
and for plausibility with other signals. The
signal range limits and plausibility criteria
must be defined by the application devel-
oper. These limits must firstly be sufficiently
broad to ensure that extreme conditions
(e.g. hot or cold weather, high altitudes) do
not produce false diagnoses, but secondly,
sufficiently narrow to provide adequate sen-
sitivity to real faults. In addition, fault re-
sponse procedures must be defined to spec-
ify whether and in what way the engine may
continue to be operated if a specific fault is
detected. Finally, detected faults have to be
stored in a fault memory so that service
technicians can quickly locate and rectify 
the problem.

Testing under extreme climatic
 conditions
Testing procedures include trials under ex-
treme climatic conditions that are normally
only encountered under exceptional circum-
stances during the service life of the vehicle.
The conditions that are encountered during
these trials can only be simulated to a lim-
ited degree on a test bench because the sub-

Application-related adaptation

Hot-weather trials
Hot-weather trials cover the temperature
range from approx. + 15 °C to + 40 °C. 
These trials are carried out at locations such
as southern France, Spain, Italy, the U.S.,
South Africa and Australia. Despite the great
distances involved and the corresponding
high cost of equipment transportation,
South Africa and Australia are of interest
 because they offer hot-weather conditions
during the European winter. Due to the ever
increasing demands to shorten development
times, such possibilities have to be consid-
ered.

Altitude trials
Altitude trials involve testing at altitudes
 between 0 and approx. 4000 meters. It is not
only the absolute altitude that is of impor-
tance to the tests but, in many cases, a rapid
change in altitude within a short space of
time. Altitude trials are generally carried out
in combination with hot or cold-weather
trials. 

Once again, an important component 
is testing the start characteristics. Other as-
pects examined include mixture adaptation,
tank ventilation, knock control and a range
of diagnostic functions.

Hot-weather trials test such things as hot
starting, tank ventilation, tank leakage detec-
tion, knock control, exhaust-gas tempera-
ture control and a wide variety of diagnostic
functions.

Quality management

343

The following types of FMEA are distin-
guished:
(cid:2) Design FMEA: assessment of the design of
systems for compliance with the specifica-
tions. It also tests how the system reacts in
the event of design faults

(cid:2) Process FMEA: assessment of the produc-

tion process

(cid:2) System FMEA: assessment of the interac-

tion of system components

FMEA assessments are based on theoretical
principles and practical experience. 

Example: a direction indicator fails. The
 effects in terms of road safety are serious. The
likelihood of discovery by the driver is small,
however, since the indicator is not visible
from inside the vehicle. As a means of making
the fault obvious, the rate at which the indi-
cators flash must be made to change if an in-
dicator fails. The higher flashing rate is dis-
cernible both visually on the instrument clus-
ter and audibly. As a result of this modifica-
tion, the effect of the fault can be  reduced.

Review
The review is an effective quality assurance
tool in software development in particular.
Reviewers check the compliance of the work
produced with the applicable requirements
and objectives.

The review can be usefully employed as 
a means of checking progress made even 
at early stages of the development process. 
Its aim is to identify and eliminate any faults
at as early a point as possible.

Quality management

Quality assurance measures accompany 
the entire development process, and sub -
sequently the production process as well. 
Only in that way can consistent quality of the
end product be guaranteed. The quality re-
quirements placed on safety-related systems
(e. g. ABS) are particularly strict.

Quality assurance systems
All elements of a quality management system
and all quality assurance measures have to be
systematically planned. The various tasks, au-
thorities and responsibilities are defined in
writing in the quality management hand-
book. International standards such as ISO
9001 to 9004 are also adopted.

In order to regularly monitor all elements of a
quality management system, quality audits
are carried out. Their purpose is to assess the
extent to which the requirements of the qual-
ity management system are being followed
and the effectiveness with which the quality
requirements and objectives are  being met.

Quality assessment
On completion of specific stages in the devel-
opment process, all information available up
to that point about quality and reliability is
subjected to a quality assessment and any
necessary remedial action initiated. 

FMEA
FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analyzis) is
an analytical method for identifying potential
weaknesses and assessing their significance.
Systematic optimisation results in risk and
fault cost reduction and leads to improved re-
liability. FMEA is suitable for analyzing the
types of fault occurring on  system compo-
nents and their effects on the system as a
whole. The effect of a fault can be described
by a causal chain from point of origin (e.g.
sensor) to system (e.g. vehicle).
