Safety systems

Motor-vehicle safety

In addition to the components of the drive-
train (engine, transmission), which provide
the vehicle with its means of forward motion,
the vehicle systems that limit movement and
retard the vehicle also have an important role
to play. Without them, safe use of the vehicle
in road traffic would not be possible. Further-
more, systems that protect vehicle occupants
in the event of an accident are also becoming
increasingly important.

Safety systems

There are a many factors that affect vehicle
safety in road traffic situations:
(cid:1) the condition of the vehicle (e.g. level of

equipment, condition of tires, component
wear),

(cid:1) the weather, road surface and traffic condi-
tions (e.g. side winds, type of road surface
and density of traffic), and

(cid:1) the capabilities of the driver, i.e. his/her

driving skills and physical and mental con-
dition.

In the past, it was essentially only the braking
system (apart, of course, from the vehicle
lights) consisting of brake pedal, brake 
lines and wheel brakes that contributed 
to vehicle safety. Over the course of time
though, more and more systems that actively
intervene in braking-system operation have
been added. Because of their active interven-

tion, these safety systems are also referred to
as active safety systems. 

The motor-vehicle safety systems that are
found on the most up-to-date vehicles sub-
stantially improve their safety.

The brakes are an essential component of 
a motor vehicle. They are indispensable for
safe use of the vehicle in road traffic. At the
slow speeds and with the small amount of
traffic that were encountered in the early
years of motoring, the demands placed on 
the braking system were far less exacting 
than they are today. Over the course of time, 
braking systems have become more and 
more highly developed. In the final analysis,
the high speeds that cars can be driven at
 today are only possible because there are
 reliable braking systems which are capable 
of slowing down the vehicle and bringing it
safely to a halt even in hazardous situations.
Consequently, the braking system is a key
part of a vehicle’s safety systems.

As in all other areas of automotive engineer-
ing, electronics have also become established
in the safety systems. The demands now
placed on safety systems can only be met 
with the aid of electronic equipment.

Active safety systems 
These systems help to prevent accidents 
and thus make a preventative contribution to
road safety. Examples of active vehicle safety
systems include
(cid:1) ABS (Antilock Braking System),
(cid:1) TCS (Traction Control System), and 
(cid:1) ESP (Electronic Stability Program). 

These safety systems stabilize the vehicle’s
handling response in critical situations and
thus maintain its steerability.

Passive safety systems
These systems are designed to protect  vehicle
occupants from serious injury in the event of
an accident. They reduce the risk of injury
and thus the severity of the consequences of
an accident. 

Examples of passive safety systems are the
seat-belts required by law, and airbags –
which can now be fitted in various positions
inside the vehicle such as in front of or at the
side of the occupants. 

Apart from their contribution to vehicle
safety, systems such as Adaptive Cruise
 Control (ACC) essentially offer added conve-
nience by maintaining the distance from the
vehicle in front by automatically throttling
back the engine or applying the brakes.

Fig. 1 illustrates the safety systems and
 components that are found on modern-day
vehicles equipped with the most advanced
technology.

Basics of vehicle operation

Basics of vehicle operation

Driver behavior
The first step in adapting vehicle response 
to reflect the driver and his/her capabilities is
to analyze driver behavior as a whole.  Driver
behavior is broken down into two  basic cate-
gories:
(cid:1) vehicle guidance, and
(cid:1) response to vehicle instability.

The essential feature of the “vehicle guidance”
aspect is the driver’s aptitude in anticipating
subsequent developments; this translates into
the ability to analyze current driving condi-
tions and the associated interrelationships in
order to accurately gauge such factors as:
(cid:1) the amount of initial steering input re-
quired to maintain consistently optimal
cornering lines when cornering,

(cid:1) the points at which braking must be initi-
ated in order to stop within available dis-
tances, and

(cid:1) when acceleration should be started in order
to overtake slower vehicles without risk.

Steering angle, braking and throttle applica-
tion are vital elements within the guidance
process. The precision with which these 
functions are discharged depends upon 
the driver’s level of experience.

1

Overall system of “Driver – Vehicle – Environment”

While stabilizing the vehicle (response to vehi-
cle instability), the driver determines that the
actual path being taken deviates from the in-
tended course (the road’s path) and that the
originally estimated control inputs (steering
angle, accelerator pedal pressure) must be
 revised to avoid traction loss or prevent the 
vehicle leaving the road. The amount of stabi-
lization (correction) response necessary after
initiation of any given maneuver is inversely
proportional to the driver’s ability to estimate
initial guidance inputs; more driver ability
leads to greater vehicle stability. Progressively
higher levels of correspondence between the
initial control input (steering angle) and the
actual cornering line produce progressively
lower correction requirements; the vehicle
 reacts to these minimal corrections with
 “linear” response (driver input is transferred 
to the road surface proportionally, with no
substantial deviations).

Experienced drivers can accurately antici-
pate both how the vehicle will react to their
control inputs and how this reactive motion
will combine with predictable external fac-
tors and forces (when approaching curves
and road works etc.). Novices not only need
more time to complete this adaptive process,
their results will also harbor a greater poten-
tial for error. The conclusion is that inexperi-

enced drivers concentrate most of their at-
tention on the stabilization aspect of driving.
When an unforeseen development arises
for driver and vehicle (such as an unexpect-
edly sharp curve in combination with re-
stricted vision, etc.), the former may react in-
correctly, and the latter can respond by going
into a skid. Under these circumstances, the
vehicle responds non-linearly and trans-
gresses beyond its physical stability limits, 
so that the driver can no longer anticipate 
the line it will ultimately take. In such cases, it
is impossible for either the novice or the ex-
perienced driver to retain control over his/her
vehicle.

Accident causes and prevention
Human error is behind the vast majority 
of all road accidents resulting in injury.
 Accident statistics reveal that driving at an in-
appropriate speed is the primary cause for
most accidents. Other accident sources are 
(cid:1) incorrect use of the road,
(cid:1) failure to maintain the safety margin to the

preceding vehicle,

(cid:1) errors concerning right-of-way and traffic

priority,

(cid:1) errors occurring when making turns, and
(cid:1) driving under the influence of alcohol.

Technical deficiencies (lighting, tires, brakes,
etc.) and defects related to the vehicle in gen-
eral are cited with relative rarity as accident
sources. Accident causes beyond the control
of the driver more frequently stem from other
factors (such as weather).

These facts demonstrate the urgency of
continuing efforts to enhance and extend the
scope of automotive safety technology (with
special emphasis on the associated electronic
systems). Improvements are needed to 
(cid:1) provide the driver with optimal support in

critical situations,

(cid:1) prevent accidents in the first place, and
(cid:1) reduce the severity of accidents when they

do occur.

The designer’s response to critical driving
conditions must thus be to foster “pre-
dictable” vehicle behavior during operation 
at physical limits and in extreme situations. 
A range of parameters (wheel speed, lateral
acceleration, yaw velocity, etc.) can be moni-
tored for processing in one or several elec-
tronic control units (ECUs). This capability
forms the basis of a concept for virtually
 immediate implementation of suitable re-
sponse strategies to enhance driver control of
critical processes.

The following situations and hazards pro-
vide examples of potential “limit conditions”:
(cid:1) changes in prevailing road and/or weather

conditions,

(cid:1) “conflicts of interest” with other road users,
(cid:1) animals and/or obstructions on the road,

(cid:1) a sudden defect (tire blow-out, etc.) on the

and

vehicle.

Critical traffic situations
The one salient factor that distinguishes criti-
cal traffic situations is abrupt change, such as
the sudden appearance of an unexpected ob-
stacle or a rapid change in road-surface condi-
tions. The problem is frequently compounded
by operator error. Owing to lack of experi-
ence, a driver who is travelling too fast or is
not concentrating on the road will not be able
to react with the judicious and rational re-
sponse that the circumstances demand.

Because drivers only rarely experience this
kind of critical situation, they usually fail to
recognize how close evasive action or a brak-
ing maneuver has brought them to the vehi-
cle’s physical limits. They do not grasp how
much of the potential adhesion between tires
and road surface has already been “used up”
and fail to perceive that the vehicle may be at
its maneuverability limit or about to skid off
the road. The driver is not prepared for this
and reacts either incorrectly or too precipi-
tously. The ultimate results are accidents and
scenaria that pose threats to other road users.

6

Motor-vehicle safety

Basics of vehicle operation

steering, 

(cid:1) compliance with applicable traffic laws and

These factors are joined by still other potential
accident sources including outdated technol-
ogy and deficiencies in infrastructure (badly
designed roads, outdated traffic-guidance
concepts).

Terms such as “improvements in vehicle re-
sponse” and “support for the driver in critical
situations” are only meaningful if they refer to
mechanisms that produce genuine long-term
reductions in both the number and severity of
accidents. Lowering or removing the risk from
these critical situations entails executing diffi-
cult driving maneuvers including
(cid:1) rapid steering inputs including counter-

(cid:1) lane changes during emergency braking,
(cid:1) maintaining precise tracking while negoti-
ating curves at high speeds and in the face
of changes in the road surface.

These kinds of maneuvers almost always pro-
voke a critical response from the vehicle, i.e.,
lack of tire traction prevents the vehicle react-
ing in the way that the driver would normally
expect; it deviates from the desired course.

Due to lack of experience in these borderline

situations, the driver is frequently unable to 
regain active control of the vehicle, and often
panics or overreacts. Evasive action serves as an
example. After applying excessive steering input
in the moment of initial panic, this driver then
countersteers with even greater zeal in an at-
tempt to compensate for his initial error. Ex-
tended sequences of steering and countersteer-
ing with progressively greater input angles then
lead to a loss of control over the vehicle, which
responds by breaking into a skid.

Driving behavior
A vehicle’s on-the-road handling and braking
response are defined by a variety of influ-
ences. These can be roughly divided into
three general categories:
(cid:1) vehicle characteristics,
(cid:1) the driver’s behavior patterns, ability and

reflexes, and

(cid:1) peripheral circumstances/or influences
from the surroundings or from outside.

A vehicle’s handling, braking and overall
 dynamic response are influenced by its struc-
ture and design.

Handling and braking responses define the
vehicle’s reactions to driver inputs (at steering
wheel, accelerator pedal, brakes, etc.) as do
external interference factors (road-surface
condition, wind, etc.).

Good handling is characterized by the ability
to precisely follow a given course and thus
comply in full with driver demand.
The driver’s responsibilities include:
(cid:1) adapting driving style to reflect traffic and

road conditions,

regulations,

(cid:1) following the optimal course as defined by
the road’s geometry as closely as possible,
and

(cid:1) guiding the vehicle with foresight and

 circumspection.

The driver pursues these objectives by
 continuously adapting the vehicle’s position
and motion to converge with a subjective
conception of an ideal status. The driver relies
upon personal experience to anticipate devel-
opments and adapt to instantaneous traffic
conditions.

(cid:1) stability,
(cid:1) steering response and brake performance,

and

(cid:1) handling at the limit. The tests are intended
to describe these factors as a basis for imple-
menting subsequent improvements.

The advantages of this procedure are:
(cid:1) it allows assessment of the overall, synergis-

tic system (“driver – vehicle – environ-
ment”) and

(cid:1) supports realistic simulation of numerous
situations encountered under everyday
traffic conditions.

The disadvantages of this procedure are:
(cid:1) the results extend through a broad scatter
range, as drivers, wind, road conditions
and initial status vary from one maneuver
to the next,

(cid:1) subjective impressions and experience 

are colored by the latitude for individual
interpretation, and

(cid:1) the success or failure of an entire test series
can ultimately be contingent upon the abil-
ities of a single driver.

Table 1 (next page) lists the essential vehicle
maneuvers for evaluating vehicle response
within a closed control loop.

Owing to the subjective nature of human
behavior, there are still no definitions of dy-
namic response in a closed control loop that
are both comprehensive and objectively
grounded (closed-loop operation, meaning
with driver, Fig. 2).

Despite this, the objective driving tests are
complimented by various test procedures ca-
pable of informing experienced drivers about
a vehicle’s handling stability (example: slalom
course).

Evaluating driver behavior
Subjective assessments made by experienced
drivers remain the prime element in evalua-
tions of vehicle response. Because assessments
based on subjective perceptions are only rela-
tive and not absolute, they cannot serve as the
basis for defining objective “truths”. As a re-
sult, subjective experience with one vehicle
can be applied to other vehicles only on a
comparative, relative basis.

Test drivers assess vehicle response using
selected maneuvers conceived to reflect “nor-
mal” traffic situations. The overall  system (in-
cluding the driver) is judged as a closed loop.
While the element “driver” cannot be pre-
cisely defined, this process provides a replace-
ment by inputting objective, specifically de-
fined interference factors into the system. The
resulting vehicular reaction is then analyzed
and evaluated. The following maneuvers are
either defined in existing ISO standards or
currently going through the standardization
process. These dry-surface exercises serve as
recognized procedures for assessing vehicular
stability:
(cid:1) steady-state skid-pad circulation,
(cid:1) transition response,
(cid:1) braking while cornering,
(cid:1) sensitivity to crosswinds,
(cid:1) Straight-running properties 
(tracking  stability), and 
(cid:1) load change on the skid pad.

In this process, prime factors such as road
geometry and assignments taken over by 
the driver assume vital significance. Each test
driver attempts to gather impressions and ex-
perience in the course of various prescribed
vehicle maneuvers; the subsequent analysis
process may well include comparisons of the
impressions registered by different drivers.
These often hazardous driving maneuvers
(e.g. the standard VDA evasive-action test,
also known as the “elk test”) are executed by a
series of drivers to generate data describing
the dynamic response and general handling
characteristics of the test vehicle. The criteria
include:

Transition response
Transition response joins steady-state self-
steering properties (during skid-pad circula-
tion) as a primary assessment parameter. 
This category embraces such maneuvers as
suddenly taking rapid evasive action when
driving straight ahead.

The “elk test” simulates an extreme sce-
nario featuring sudden evasive action to 
avoid an obstacle. A vehicle traveling over 
a 50 meter stretch of road must safely drive
around an obstacle 10 meters in length pro-
jecting outward onto the track by a distance
of 4 meters (Fig. 3).

Braking during cornering – 
load-change reactions
One of the most critical situations encoun-
tered in every-day driving – and thus one 
of the most vital considerations for vehicle
design – is braking during cornering.

From the standpoint of the physical forces
involved, whether the driver simply releases
the accelerator or actually depresses the brake
pedal is irrelevant; the physical effects will not
differ dramatically. The resulting load shift
from rear to front increasing the rear slip an-
gle while reducing that at the front, and since
neither the given cornering radius nor the 
vehicle speed modifies the lateral force 
requirement, the vehicle tends to adopt an
oversteering attitude.

With rear-wheel drive, tire slip exerts less
influence on the vehicle’s intrinsic handling
response than with front-wheel drive; this
means that RWD vehicles are more stable 
under these conditions.

Vehicle reaction during this maneuver
must represent the optimal compromise
 between steering response, stability and 
braking efficiency.

Driving maneuvers
Steady-state skid-pad circulation
Steady-state cornering around the skid pad 
is employed to determine maximum lateral
acceleration. This procedure also provides in-
formation on the transitions that dynamic
handling undergoes as cornering forces climb
to their maximum. This information can be
used to define the vehicle’s intrinsic handling
(self-steering) properties (oversteer, under-
steer, neutral cornering response).

Basics of vehicle operation

Parameters
The primary parameters applied in the assess-
ment of dynamic handling response are:
(cid:1) steering-wheel angle,
(cid:1) lateral acceleration,
(cid:1) longitudinal acceleration or longitudinal

deceleration,
(cid:1) yaw velocity,
(cid:1) side-slip angle and roll angle.

Additional data allow more precise definition
of specific handling patterns as a basis for
evaluating other test results:
(cid:1) longitudinal and lateral velocity,
(cid:1) steering angles of front/rear wheels,
(cid:1) slip angle at all wheels,
(cid:1) steering-wheel force.

Reaction time
Within the overall system “driver-vehicle-
 environment”, the driver’s physical condition
and state of mind, and thus his/her reaction
times, join the parameters described above as
decisive factors. This lag period is the time
that elapses between perception of an obstacle
and initial application of pressure to the 
brake pedal. The decision to act and the foot
movement count as intermediate stages in 
this process. This period is not consistent; 
depending upon personal factors and external
circumstances it is at least 0.3 seconds.

Special examinations are required to 

quantify individual reaction patterns 
(as conducted by medical/psychological
 institutes).

Motion
Vehicle motion may be consistent in nature
(constant speed) or it may be inconsistent
(during acceleration from a standing or
rolling start, or deceleration and braking with
the accompanying change in velocity).

The engine generates the kinetic energy 
required to propel the vehicle. Forces stem-
ming either from external sources or acting
through the engine and drivetrain must
 always be applied to the vehicle as a basic
condition for changes in the magnitude 
and direction of its motion.

Handling and braking response 
in  commercial vehicles
Objective evaluation of handling and braking
response in heavy commercial vehicles is
based on various driving maneuvers includ-
ing steady-state skid-pad cornering, abrupt
steering-angle change (vehicle reaction to
“tugging” the steering wheel through a speci-
fied angle) and braking during cornering.
The dynamic lateral response of tractor
and trailer combinations generally differs
substantially from that of single vehicles. 
Particular emphasis is placed on tractor 
and trailer loading, while other important
factors include design configuration and the
geometry of the linkage elements within the
combination.

The worst-case scenario features an empty

truck pulling a loaded central-axle trailer.

 requires a high degree of skill and circum-
spection on the part of the driver.

Jack-knifing is also a danger when tractor-
trailer combinations are braked in extreme sit-
uations. This process is characterized by a loss
of lateral traction at the tractor’s rear axle and

is triggered when “overbraking” on slippery
road surfaces, or by extreme yaw rates on 
µ-split surfaces (with different friction
 coefficients at the center and on the shoulder
of the lane). Jack-knifing can be avoided with
the aid of antilock braking systems (ABS).

There are a number of different tire designs

determined by the characteristics required of
it in normal conditions and emergency situa-
tions. 

Legal requirements and regulations specify
which tires must be used in which conditions,
the maximum speeds at which different types
of tire may be used, and the criteria by which
tires are classified.

Radial tires
In a radial tire, the type which has now be-
come the standard for cars, the cords of the
tire-casing plies run radially, following the
shortest route from bead to bead (Fig. 1). 
A reinforcing belt runs around the perimeter
of the relatively thin, flexible casing. 

A body can only be made to move or change
course by the action of forces. Many forces
act upon a vehicle when it is being driven. An
important role is played by the tires as any
change of speed or direction involves forces
acting on the tires.

Tires

Task
The tire is the connecting link between the
vehicle and the road. It is at that point that
the safe handling of a vehicle is ultimately de-
cided. The tire transmits motive, braking and
lateral forces within a physical environment
whose parameters define the limits 
of the dynamic loads to which the vehicle 
is subjected. The decisive criteria for the
 assessment of tire quality are:
(cid:0) Straight-running ability
(cid:0) Stable cornering properties 
(cid:0) Ability to grip on a variety of road  surfaces
(cid:0) Ability to grip in a variety of weather

 conditions

(cid:0) Steering characteristics
(cid:0) Ride comfort (vibration absorption 

and damping, quietness)

(cid:0) Durability and
(cid:0) Economy

Cross-ply tires
The cross-ply tire takes its name from the fact
that the cords of alternate plies of the tire cas-
ing run at right angles to one another so that
they cross each other. This type of tire is now
only of significance for motorcycles, bicycles,
and industrial and agricultural vehicles. On
commercial vehicles it is increasingly being
supplanted by the radial tire.

Regulations
In Europe, the Council Directives, and in 
the USA the FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard) require that motor vehicles
and trailers are fitted with pneumatic tires
with a tread pattern consisting of grooves
with a depth of at least 1.6 mm around the
entire circumference of the tire and across the
full width of the tread.

Cars and motor vehicles with a permissible
laden weight of less than 2.8 tonnes and de-
signed for a maximum speed of more than 
40 km/h, and trailers towed by them, must 
be fitted either with cross-ply tires all round 
or with radial tires all round; in the case of
 vehicle-and-trailer combinations the require-
ment applies individually to each unit of the
combination. It does not apply to trailers
towed by vehicles at speeds of up to 25 km/h.

Application
To ensure correct use of tires, it is important
the correct tire is selected according to the
recommendations of the vehicle or tire man-
ufacturer. Fitting the same type of tire to all
wheels of a vehicle ensures the best handling
results. The specific instructions of the tire
manufacturer or a tire specialist regarding tire
care, maintenance, storage and fitting should
be followed in order to obtain maximum
durability and safety.

When the tires are in use, i.e. when they are
fitted to the wheel, care should be taken to
ensure that
(cid:0) the wheels are balanced so as to guarantee

optimum evenness of running,

(cid:0) all wheels are fitted with the same type of

tire and the tires are the correct size for the
vehicle,

(cid:0) the vehicle is not driven at speeds in  excess
of the maximum allowed for the tires fit-
ted, and

(cid:0) the tires have sufficient depth of tread.

The less tread there is on a tire, the thinner is
the layer of material protecting the belt and
the casing underneath it. And particularly on
cars and fast commercial vehicles, insufficient
tread depth on wet road surfaces has a deci-
sive effect on safe handling characteristics due
to the reduction in grip. Braking distance in-
creases disproportionately as tread depth re-
duces (Fig. 2). An especially critical handling
scenario is aquaplaning in which all adhesion
between tires and road surface is lost and the
vehicle is no longer steerable.

14

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Tires

Tire slip
Tire slip, or simply “slip”, is said to occur
when there is a difference between the theo-
retical and the actual distance traveled by a
vehicle. 

This can be illustrated by the following exam-
ple in which we will assume that the circum-
ference of a car tire is 2 meters. If the wheel ro-
tates ten times, the distance traveled should be
20 meters. If tire slip occurs, however, the dis-
tance actually traveled by the braked vehicle is
greater.

Causes of tire slip
When a wheel rotates under the effect of
power transmission or braking, complex
physical processes take place in the contact
area between tire and road which place the
rubber parts under stress and cause them 
to partially slide, even if the wheel does not
fully lock. In other words, the elasticity of the
tire causes it to deform and “flex” to a greater
or lesser extent depending on the weather
conditions and the nature of the road surface.
As the tire is made largely of rubber, only a
proportion of the “deformation energy” is re-
covered as the tread moves out of the contact
area. The tire heats up in the process and en-
ergy loss occurs.

Illustration of slip
The slip component of wheel rotation is
 referred to by λ, where

The quantity υF is the vehicle road speed, υU
is the circumferential velocity of the wheel
(Fig. 3). The formula states that brake slip 
occurs as soon as the wheel is rotating more
slowly than the vehicle road speed would nor-
mally demand. Only under that condition 
can braking forces or acceleration forces be
transmitted.

Since the tire slip is generated as a result 
of the vehicle’s longitudinal movement, 
it is also referred to as “longitudinal slip”. 
The slip generated during braking is usually
termed “brake slip”.

If a tire is subjected to other factors in addi-
tion to slip (e.g. greater weight acting on the
wheels, extreme wheel positions), its force
transmission and handling characteristics will
be adversely affected.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

15

Forces acting on a vehicle

Theory of inertia
Inertia is the property possessed by all bodies,
by virtue of which they will naturally main-
tain the status in which they find themselves,
i.e. either at rest or in motion. In order to
bring about a change to that status, a force
has to be applied to the body. For  example,
if a car’s brakes are applied when it is 
cornering on black ice, the car will carry on 
in a straight line without altering course and
without noticeably slowing down. That is be-
cause on black ice, only very small tire forces
can be applied to the wheels.

Turning forces
Rotating bodies are influenced by turning
forces. The rotation of the wheels, for example,
is slowed down due to the braking torque and
accelerated due to the drive torque. 

Turning forces act on the entire vehicle. 
If the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on
a slippery surface (e. g. black ice) while the
wheels on the other side are on a road surface
with normal grip (e. g. asphalt), the vehicle
will slew around its vertical axis when the
brakes are applied (µ-split braking). This ro-
tation is caused by the yaw  moment, which
arises due to the different forces applied to
the sides of the vehicle.

1

Forces acting on a vehicle

Distribution of forces
In addition to the vehicle’s weight (resulting
from gravitational force), various different
types of force act upon it regardless of its
state of motion (Fig. 1). Some of these are 
(cid:0) forces which act along the longitudinal axis

of the vehicle (e. g. motive force,
 aerodynamic drag or rolling friction); oth-
ers are 

(cid:0) forces which act laterally on the vehicle

(e. g. steering force, centrifugal force when
cornering or crosswinds). The tire forces
which act laterally on the vehicle are also
referred to as lateral forces.

The longitudinal and the lateral forces are
transmitted either “downwards” or “sideways”
to the tires and ultimately to the road. The
forces are transferred through
(cid:0) the chassis (e. g. wind),
(cid:0) the steering (steering force),
(cid:0) the engine and transmission (motive

force), or

(cid:0) the braking system (braking force).

Opposing forces act “upwards” from the road
onto the tires and thence to the vehicle be-
cause every force produces an opposing force.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

Basically, in order for the vehicle to move, the
motive force of the engine (engine torque)
must overcome all forces that resist motion
(all longitudinal and lateral forces) such as 
are generated by road gradient or camber.
In order to assess the dynamic handling
characteristics or handling stability of a vehi-
cle, the forces acting between the tires and the
road, i.e. the forces transmitted in the contact
areas between tire and road surface (also re-
ferred to as “tire contact area” or “footprint”),
must be known.

With more practice and experience, a driver
generally learns to react more effectively to
those forces. They are evident to the driver
when accelerating or slowing down as well as
in cross winds or on slippery road surfaces. If
the forces are particularly strong, i.e. if they
produce exaggerated changes in the motion
of the vehicle, they can also be dangerous
(skidding) or at least are detectable by squeal-
ing tires (e.g. when accelerating aggressively)
and increased component wear.

2

Components of tire force and pressure distribution
over the footprint of a radial tire

Tire forces
A motor vehicle can only be made to move 
or change its direction in a specific way by
forces acting through the tires. Those forces
are made up of the following components
(Fig. 2):

Circumferential force
The circumferential force FU is produced by
power transmission or braking. It acts on the
road surface as a linear force in line with the
longitudinal axis of the vehicle and enables
the driver to increase the speed of the vehicle
using the accelerator or slow it down with the
brakes.

Vertical tire force (normal force)
The vertical force acting downwards between
the tire and road surface is called the vertical
tire force or normal force FN. It acts on the
tires at all times regardless of the state of mo-
tion of the vehicle, including, therefore, when
the vehicle is stationary. 

The vertical force is determined by the pro-

portion of the combined weight of vehicle
and payload that is acting on the individual
wheel concerned. It also depends on the de-
gree of upward or downward gradient 
of the road that the vehicle is standing on.
The highest levels of vertical force occur on a
level road.

Other forces acting on the vehicle (e.g.
heavier payload) can increase or decrease the
vertical force. When cornering, the force is re-
duced on the inner wheels and increased on
the outer wheels.

The vertical tire force deforms the part of the
tire in contact with the road. As the tire side-
walls are affected by that deformation, the
vertical force cannot be evenly distributed. A
trapezoidal pressure-distribution pattern is
produced (Fig. 2). The tire sidewalls absorb
the forces and the tire deforms according to
the load applied to it.

Forces acting on a vehicle

17

Lateral force
Lateral forces act upon the wheels when steer-
ing or when there is a crosswind, for  example.
They cause the vehicle to change direction. 

Braking torque
When the brakes are applied, the brake shoes
press against the brake drums (in the case of
drum brakes) or the brake pads press against
the disks (in the case of disk brakes). This
generates frictional forces, the level of which
can be controlled by the driver by the pres-
sure applied to the brake pedal. 

The product of the frictional forces and the
distance at which they act from the axis of ro-
tation of the wheel is the braking torque MB.
That torque is effective at the circumfer-

ence of the tire under braking (Fig. 1).

Yaw moment
The yaw moment around the vehicle’s vertical
axis is caused by different longitudinal forces
acting on the left and right-hand sides of the
vehicle or different lateral forces acting at the
front and rear axles. Yaw moments are re-
quired to turn the vehicle when cornering.
Undesired yaw moments, such as can occur
when braking on µ-split (see above) or if the
vehicle pulls to one side when braking, can be
reduced using suitable design measures. The
kingpin offset is the distance between the
point of contact between the tire and the road
and the point at which the wheel’s steering
axis intersects the road surface (Fig. 3). It is
negative if the point at which the steering axis
intersects the road surface is on the outside of
the point of contact between tire and road.
Braking forces combine with positive and
negative kingpin offset to create a lever effect
that produces a turning force at the steering
which can lead to a certain steering angle at
the wheel. If the kingpin offset is negative,
this steering angle counters the undesired yaw
moment.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

Friction force
Coefficient of friction
When braking torque is applied to a wheel, 
a braking force FB is generated between the
tire and the road surface that is proportional
to the braking torque under stationary condi-
tions (no wheel acceleration). The braking
force transmitted to the road (frictional force
FR) is proportional to the vertical tire force
FN:

FR = µHF · FN

The factor µHF is the coefficient of friction. 
It defines the frictional properties of the vari-
ous possible material pairings between tire
and road surface and the environmental con-
ditions to which they are exposed. 

The coefficient of friction is thus a measure

of the braking force that can be transmitted.
It is dependent on
(cid:0) the nature of the road surface,
(cid:0) the condition of the tires,
(cid:0) the vehicle’s road speed, and
(cid:0) the weather conditions.

The coefficient of friction ultimately deter-
mines the degree to which the braking torque
is actually effective. For motor-vehicle tires,
the coefficient of friction is at its highest on a

clean and dry road surface; it is at its lowest
on ice. Fluids (e.g. water) or dirt between the
tire and the road surface reduce the coeffi-
cient of friction. The figures quoted in Table 1
apply to concrete and tarmacadam road sur-
faces in good condition.

On wet road surfaces in particular, the
 coefficient of friction is heavily dependent on
vehicle road speed. At high speeds on less
than ideal road surfaces, the wheels may lock
up under braking because the coefficient of
friction is not high enough to provide suffi-
cient adhesion for the tires to grip the road
surface. Once a wheel locks up, it can no
longer transmit side forces and the vehicle 
is thus no longer steerable. Fig. 5 illustrates
the frequency distribution of the coefficient
of friction at a locked wheel at various road
speeds on wet roads. 

The friction or adhesion between the tire and
the road surface determines the wheel’s abil-
ity to transmit force. The ABS (Antilock
Braking System) and TCS (Traction Control
System) safety systems utilize the available
adhesion to its maximum potential.

Effect of brake slip on coefficient of friction
When a vehicle is pulling away or accelerating
– just as when braking or decelerating – the
transmission of forces from tire to road de-
pends on the degree of adhesion between the
two. The friction of a tire basically has 
a constant relationship to the level of adhe-
sion under braking or acceleration.

Fig. 6 shows the progression of the coeffi-
cient of friction µHF under braking. Starting
from a zero degree of brake slip, is rises
steeply to its maximum at between 10% 
and 40% brake slip, depending on the nature
of the road surface and the tires, and then
drops away again. The rising slope of the

Aquaplaning
The amount of friction approaches zero if
rainwater forms a film on the road surface on
which the vehicle then “floats”. Contact be-
tween the tires and the road surface is then
lost and the effect known as aquaplaning oc-
curs. Aquaplaning is caused by a “wedge” of
water being forced under the  entire contact
area of the tire with the road surface, thereby
lifting it off the ground. Aquaplaning is de-
pendent on:
(cid:0) the depth of water on the road,
(cid:0) the speed of the vehicle,
(cid:0) the tire tread pattern, tire width and level

(cid:0) the force pressing the tire against the road

of wear, and

surface.

Wide tires are particularly susceptible to
aquaplaning. When a vehicle is aquaplaning,
it cannot be steered or braked. Neither steer-
ing movements nor braking forces can be
transmitted to the road.

Kinetic friction
When describing processes involving friction,
a distinction is made between static friction
and kinetic friction. With solid bodies, the
static friction is greater than kinetic friction.
Accordingly, for a rolling rubber tire there are
circumstances in which the coefficient of fric-
tion is greater than when the wheel locks.
Nevertheless, the tire can also slide while it is
rolling, and on motor vehicles this is referred
to as slip.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

curve represents the “stable zone” (partial-
braking zone), while the falling slope is the
“unstable zone”.

Most braking operations involve minimal lev-
els of slip and take place within the stable
zone so that an increase in the degree of slip
simultaneously produces an increase in the
usable adhesion. In the unstable zone, an
 increase in the amount of slip generally pro-
duces a reduction in the level of adhesion.
When braking in such situations, the wheel
can lock up within a fraction of a second, and
under acceleration the excess power-trans-
mission torque rapidly increases the wheel’s
speed of rotation causing it to spin.

When a vehicle is traveling in a straight line,
ABS and TCS prevent it entering the unstable
zone when braking or accelerating. 

Sideways forces
If a lateral force acts on a rolling wheel, the
center of the wheel moves sideways. The  ratio
between the lateral velocity and the velocity
along the longitudinal axis is referred to as
“lateral slip”. The angle between the resulting
velocity, υα, and the forward velocity, υx, is
called the “lateral slip angle α” (Fig. 7). The
side-slip angle, γ, is the angle between the ve-
hicle’s direction of travel and its longitudinal
axis. The side-slip angle encountered at high
rates of lateral acceleration is regarded as an
index of controllability, in other words the
 vehicle’s response to driver input.

Under steady-state conditions (when the
wheel is not being accelerated), the lateral
force FS acting on the center of the wheel is in
equilibrium with the lateral force applied to
the wheel by the road surface. The relation-
ship between the lateral force acting through
the center of the wheel and the wheel contact
force FN is called the “lateral-force coefficient
µS”.

21

There is a nonlinear relationship between 
the slip angle α and the lateral-force coeffi-
cient µS that can be described by a lateral 
slip curve. In contrast with the coefficient 
of friction µHF that occurs under acceleration
and braking, the lateral-force coefficient µS is
heavily dependent on the wheel contact force
FN. This characteristic is of particular interest
to vehicle manufacturers when designing sus-
pension systems so that handling characteris-
tics can be enhanced by stabilizers. 

Fig. 6 shows the lateral-force coefficient, µS,
as a function of brake slip at a lateral slip an-
gle of 4°. The lateral-force coefficient is at its
highest when the brake slip is zero. As brake
slip increases, the lateral-force coefficient de-
clines gradually at first and then increasingly
rapidly until it reaches its lowest point when
the wheel locks up. That minimum figure oc-
curs as a result of the lateral slip angle
 position of the locked wheel, which at that
point provides no lateral force whatsoever.

With a strong lateral force, FS, the tire contact
area (footprint) shifts significantly relative to
the wheel (Fig. 8). This retards the buildup 
of the lateral force. This phenomenon greatly
affects the transitional response (behavior dur-
ing transition from one dynamic state 
to another) of vehicles under steering.

Effect of brake slip on lateral forces
When a vehicle is cornering, the centrifugal
force acting outwards at the center of gravity
must be held in equilibrium by lateral forces
on all the wheels in order for the vehicle to be
able to follow the curve of the road. 

However, lateral forces can only be gener-

ated if the tires deform flexibly sideways 
so that the direction of movement of the
wheel’s center of gravity at the velocity, υα, 
diverges from the wheel center plane “m” 
by the lateral slip angle, α (Fig. 7).

Friction – tire slip – vertical tire force
The friction of a tire depends largely on the
degree of slip. The vertical tire force plays a
subordinate role, there being a roughly linear
relationship between braking force and verti-
cal tire force at a constant level of slip.

The friction, however, is also dependent on
the tire’s lateral slip angle. Thus the braking
and motive force reduces as the lateral slide
angle is increased at a constant level of tire
slip. Conversely, if the braking and motive
force remains constant while the lateral slip
angle is increased, the degree of tire slip
 increases.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Dynamics of linear motion

Dynamics of linear motion

If the rim of a wheel is subjected both to a lat-
eral force and braking torque, the road surface
reacts to this by exerting a lateral force and a
braking force on the tire. Accordingly, up to a
specific limit determined by physical parame-
ters, all forces acting on the rotating wheel are
counterbalanced by equal and opposite forces
from the road surface. 

Beyond that limit, however, the forces are

no longer in equilibrium and the vehicle’s
handling becomes unstable.

versely mounted engines), the greater is the
motive force available at the driven wheels. 
A proportion of the motive force is re-
quired to overcome the total resistance to
motion. It is adapted to suit the substantial
increase in motion resistance on uphill gradi-
ents by the use of a choice of lower gearing
ratios (multi-speed transmission). If there 
is a “surplus” of power because the motive
force is greater than the resistance to motion,
the vehicle will accelerate. If the overall resis-
tance to motion is greater, the vehicle will de-
celerate. 

Total resistance to motion
The total resistance to vehicle motion, FG, 
is the sum of the rolling resistance, aerody-
namic drag and climbing resistance (Fig. 1).
In order to overcome that total resistance, 
a sufficient amount of motive force has to 
be applied to the driven wheels. The greater
the engine torque, the higher the transmis-
sion ratio between the engine and the driven
wheels and the smaller the power loss
through the drivetrain (efficiency η is  approx.
0.88...0.92 with engines mounted 
in line, and approx. 0.91...0.95 with trans-

Rolling resistance when traveling 
in a straight line 
Rolling resistance is produced by deformation
processes which occur where the tire is in
contact with the road. It is the product of
weight and rolling resistance coefficient and
increases with a smaller wheel diameter and
the greater the degree of deformation of the
tire, e.g. if the tire is under-inflated. However,
it also increases as the weight on the wheel
and the velocity increases. Furthermore, it
varies according to type of road  surface – on
asphalt, for example, it is only around 25% of
what it is on a dirt track.

Rolling resistance when cornering 
When cornering, the rolling resistance is
increased by an extra component, cornering
resistance, the coefficient of which is depen-
dent on vehicle speed, the radius of the bend
being negotiated, suspension characteristics,
type of tires, tire pressure and lateral-slip
characteristics.

Aerodynamic drag
The aerodynamic drag FL is calculated from
the air density ρ, the drag coefficient cW
(dependent on the vehicle body shape, Tables
1 and 2), vehicle’s frontal cross-sectional area
A and the driving speed υ (taking account of
the headwind speed).

FL = cW · A · υ2 · ρ/2

Climbing resistance
Climbing resistance, FSt (if positive), or gravi-
tational pull (if negative) is the product of the
weight of the vehicle, G, and the angle of up-
hill or downhill gradient, α.

FSt = G · sin α

Acceleration and deceleration
Steady acceleration or deceleration in a
straight line occurs when the rate of accelera-
tion (or deceleration) is constant. The dis-
tance required for deceleration is of greater
significance than that required for accelera-
tion because braking distance has direct
implications in terms of vehicle and road
safety.

The braking distance is dependent on a num-
ber of factors including
(cid:2) Vehicle speed: at a constant rate of deceler-
ation, braking distance increases quadrati-
cally relative to speed.

(cid:2) Vehicle load: extra weight makes braking

distances longer.

(cid:2) Road conditions: wet roads offer less

adhesion between road surface and tires
and therefore result in longer braking
distances.

(cid:2) Tire condition: insufficient tread depth in-
creases braking distances, particularly on
wet road surfaces.

(cid:2) Condition of brakes: oil on the brake pads/
shoes, for example, reduces the friction be-
tween the pads/shoes and the disk/drum.
The lower braking force thus available
results in longer braking distances.

(cid:2) Fading: The braking power also diminishes
due to the brake components overheating.

The greatest rates of acceleration or decelera-
tion are reached at the point when the motive
or braking force is at the highest level possible
without the tires starting to lose grip (maxi-
mum traction).

The rates actually achievable under real
conditions, however, are always slightly lower
because the vehicle’s wheels are not 
all at the point of maximum adhesion at pre-
cisely the same moment. Electronic traction,
braking and vehicle-handling control systems
(TCS, ABS and ESP) are active around the
point of maximum force transmission.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Dynamics of lateral motion

Dynamics of lateral motion

Response to crosswinds 
Strong crosswinds can move a vehicle off
course, especially if it is traveling at a high
speed and its shape and dimensions present a
large surface area for the wind to catch (Fig.
1). Sudden crosswind gusts such as may be
encountered when exiting a road cutting can
cause substantial sideways movement (yaw)
of high-sided vehicles. This happens too
quickly for the driver 
to react and may provoke incorrect driver re-
sponse.

When a vehicle is driving through a cross-
wind, the wind force, FW, produces a lateral
component in addition to the longitudinal
aerodynamic drag, FL. Although its effect is
distributed across the entire body surface,
it may be thought of as a single force, the lat-
eral wind force, FSW, acting at a single point
of action “D”. The actual location of the point
of action is determined by the vehicle’s body
shape and angle of incidence α of the wind.

The point of action is generally in the 
front half of the vehicle. On conventionally
shaped saloon cars (“three-box” design) it 
is largely static and is closer to the center 
of the vehicle than on vehicles with a more
streamlined body shape (sloping back), where
it can move according to the angle 
of incidence of the wind.

The position of the center of gravity, S, on
the other hand depends on the size and dis-
tribution of the vehicle load. In view of these
variable factors, therefore, in order to arrive
at a general representation of the effect of a
crosswind (that is not affected by the relative
position of the wheels and suspension to the
body), a reference point 0 on the center line
of the vehicle at the front is adopted.

When specifying lateral wind force at a refer-
ence point other than the true point of
action, the turning force of the crosswind
around the point of action, that is the yaw
moment, MZ, must also be considered. The
crosswind force is resisted by the lateral cor-
nering forces at the wheels. The degree of lat-
eral cornering force which a pneumatic tire
can provide depends on various factors in ad-
dition to lateral slip angle and wheel load,
such as tire design and size, tire pressure and
the amount of grip afforded by 
the road surface.

A vehicle will have good directional stability
characteristics in a crosswind if the point of
action is close to the vehicle’s center of grav-
ity. Vehicles that tend to oversteer will deviate
less from their course in a crosswind if the
point of action is forward of the center of
gravity. The best position for the point of ac-
tion on vehicles with a tendency to understeer
is slightly behind the center of gravity.

Understeer and oversteer
Cornering forces between a rubber-tired
wheel and the road can only be generated
when the wheel is rotating at an angle to its
plane. A lateral slip angle must therefore be
present. A vehicle is said to understeer when,
as lateral acceleration increases, the lateral slip
angle at the front axle increases more than it
does at the rear axle. The opposite is true of a
vehicle which oversteers (Fig. 2).

For safety reasons, vehicles are designed to

slightly understeer. As a result of drive slip,
however, a front-wheel drive vehicle can
quickly change to sharply understeer or 
a rear-wheel drive vehicle to oversteer.

Centrifugal force while cornering 
Centrifugal force, Fcf, acts at the center 
of gravity, S, (Fig. 3). Its effect depends 
on a number of factors such as
(cid:2) the radius of the bend,
(cid:2) the speed of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the height of the vehicle’s center of gravity,
(cid:2) the mass of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the track of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the frictional characteristics of the tire and

road surface (tire condition, type 
of surface, weather conditions), and 
(cid:2) the load distribution in the vehicle.

Potentially hazardous situations will occur
when cornering if the centrifugal force
reaches a point where it threatens to over-
come the lateral forces at the wheels and 
the vehicle cannot be held on its intended
course. This effect can be partially counter-
acted by positive camber or banked corners.

If the vehicle slips at the front wheel, it un-
dersteers; if it slips at the wheel axle, it over-
steers. In both cases the Electronic Stability
Program (ESP) detects an undesirable rota-
tion about the vertical axle. By active inter-
vention in the form of selective braking of in-
dividual wheels, it is then able to correct the
imbalance.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Definitions

Definitions

Braking sequence
As defined in ISO 611, the term “braking
sequence” refers to all operations that take
place between the point at which operation of
the (brake) actuation device begins and the
point at which braking ends (when the brake
is released or the vehicle is at a standstill).

Variable braking 
A type of braking system which allows the
driver at any time to increase or reduce the
braking force to a sufficiently precise degree
by operating the actuation device within its
normal effective range.

If operating the actuation device in a par-

ticular manner increases the braking force,
then the opposite action must reverse the ef-
fect and reduce the braking force.

Braking-system hysteresis
Braking system hysteresis is the difference be-
tween the actuating forces when the brake is
applied and released at a constant braking
torque.

Brake hysteresis 
Brake hysteresis is the difference between the
application forces when the brake is actuated
and released at a constant braking torque.

Forces and torques 
Actuating force
The actuating force, FC, is the force that is
applied to the actuation device.

Application force
On a friction brake, the application force is
the total force exerted on the brake-pad
mount, together with attached friction mater-
ial, in order to generate the friction required
for the braking force.

Total braking force
The total braking force, Ff, is the sum total of
braking forces at each of the wheels that are
produced by the effect of the braking system
and which oppose the vehicle’s motion or its
tendency to move.

Braking torque
The braking torque is the product of the fric-
tional forces generated in the brake by the ap-
plication forces and the distance of the point of
action of those forces from the axis of rota-
tion of the wheel.

Braking-force distribution
The braking-force distribution indicates in
terms of percentage share how the total brak-
ing force, Ff, is distributed between the front
and rear wheels, e.g. front wheels 60%, rear
wheels 40%.

External brake coefficient, C
The external brake coefficient, C, is the ratio of
the output torque to the input torque or the
output force to the input force of a brake.

Internal brake coefficient, C*
The internal brake coefficient, C*, is the ratio
of the total tangential force acting at the effec-
tive radius of a brake to the application force,
FS.

Typical values: for drum brakes, values of
up to C* = 10 may be obtained, for disc brakes
C* ≈ 1.

Time periods 
The braking sequence is characterised by a
number of time periods which are defined
with reference to the ideal curves shown in
Figure 1.

Period of movement of actuation device 
The period of movement of the actuation de-
vice is the time from the point at which force
is first applied to the actuation device (t0), to
the point at which it reaches its final position
(t3) as determined by the actuating force or
the actuation travel. The same applies by anal-
ogy to the release of the brakes.(cid:7)

Response time
The response time, ta, is the time that elapses
from the point at which force is first applied
to the actuation device to the point at which
braking force is first produced (pressure gen-
erated in the brake lines) (t1 – t0).

Pressure build-up time
The pressure build-up time, ts, is the time from
the point at which braking force is first pro-
duced to the point at which the pressure in
the brake lines reaches its highest level (t5 – t1).

Total braking time
The braking time, tb, is the time that elapses
from the point at which force is first applied
to the actuation device to the point at which
braking force ceases (t7 – t0). If the vehicle
comes to a halt, then the moment at which
the vehicle is first stationary is the moment at
which the braking time ends.

Effective braking time
The effective braking time, tw, is the time that
elapses from the moment at which braking
force is first produced to the moment at
which braking force ceases (t7 – t2). If the ve-
hicle comes to a halt, then the moment at
which the vehicle is first stationary is the mo-
ment at which the effective braking time
ends.

Distances
Braking distance
The braking distance, s1, is the distance trav-
elled by a vehicle during the period of the 
effective braking time (t7 – t2).

Total braking distance
The total braking distance s0 is the distance
travelled by a vehicle during the period of the
total braking time (t7 – t0). That is the dis-
tance travelled from the point at which the
driver first applies force to the actuation de-
vice to the point at which the vehicle is at a
standstill.

Braking deceleration
Momentary deceleration 
The momentary deceleration, a, is the quotient
of the reduction in speed and the elapsed time.
a = dυ/dt

Average deceleration over the total braking
distance
From the vehicle speed υ0 at the time t0, the
average deceleration, ams, over the stopping
distance, s0, is calculated using the formula
ams = υ0

2/2s0

Mean fully developed deceleration
The figure for mean fully developed decelera-
tion, amft, represents the average deceleration
during the period in which deceleration is at
its fully developed level (t7 – t6).

Braking factor
The braking factor, Z, is the ratio between to-
tal braking force, Ff, and total static weight,
GS, (vehicle weight) acting on the axle or axles
of the vehicle. That is equivalent to the ratio
of braking deceleration, a, to gravitational ac-
celeration, g (g = 9.81 m/s2).

Car braking systems

Overview

Car braking systems

Braking systems are indispensable for the
roadworthiness and safe operation of a
 motor vehicle in road traffic conditions.
They are therefore subject to strict legal
 requirements. The increasing effectiveness
and sophistication demanded of braking 
systems over the course of time has meant
that the mechanical systems have been
 continually improved. With the advent of
microelectronics, the braking system has 
become a complex electronic system.

Overview

Car braking systems must perform the 
following fundamental tasks:
(cid:0) Reduce the speed of the vehicle
(cid:0) Bring the vehicle to a halt
(cid:0) Prevent unwanted acceleration during

downhill driving

(cid:0) Keep the vehicle stationary when it is

stopped

The first three of those tasks are performed
by the service brakes. The driver controls the
service brakes by operating the brake pedal.
The parking brake (“hand brake”) keeps the
vehicle stationary once it is at a standstill.

Conventional braking systems
On conventional braking systems, the braking
sequence is initiated exclusively by means of
force applied to the brake pedal. In the braking
system’s master cylinder, that force is converted
into hydraulic pressure. Brake fluid acts as the
transmission medium between the master
cylinder and the brakes (Figure 1). 

On power-assisted braking systems such as
are most frequently used on cars and light
commercial vehicles, the actuation pressure 
is amplified by a brake servo unit (brake
booster).

Overview

Electronic braking systems
Antilock braking system (ABS)
An electronic braking system was first used
on a volume-production vehicle in 1978. ABS
(Antilock Braking System) prevents the
wheels locking up and the vehicle becoming
uncontrollable under heavy braking. 

As with conventional systems, an ABS system
has a mechanical link between the brake pedal
and the brakes. But it also incorporates an ad-
ditional component, the hydraulic modulator.
Solenoid valves in the hydraulic modulator
are controlled in such a way that if the degree
of wheel slip exceeds a certain amount, the
brake pressure in the individual wheel cylin-
ders is selectively limited to prevent the
wheels locking.

Electronic vehicle-dynamics systems
Continuing development of the ABS system
led to the creation of TCS (Traction Control
System). This system, which was first seen on
volume-production cars in 1987, prevents
wheel spin under acceleration and thus im-
proves vehicle handling. Consequently, it is
not a braking system in the strict sense of the
word. Nevertheless, it makes use of and ac-
tively operates the braking system to prevent
a wheel from spinning.

Another vehicle-dynamics system is the 
ESP (Electronic Stability Program), which
prevents the vehicle entering a skid within
physically determined parameters. It too
makes use of and actively controls the brak-
ing system in order to stabilise the vehicle.

Ancillary functions of electronic systems
Electronic processing of data also makes pos-
sible a number of ancillary functions that can
be integrated in the overall electronic braking
and vehicle-dynamics systems.
(cid:0) Brake Assistant (BA) increases brake pres-
sure if the driver is hesitant in applying the
full force of the brakes in an emergency.
(cid:0) Electronic Braking-force distribution con-
trols the braking force at the rear wheels so
that the best possible balance between front
and rear wheel braking is achieved.

(cid:0) Hill Descent Control (HDC) automatically

brakes the vehicle on steep descents.

ABS has been continually improved and de-
veloped to the extent that it is now standard
equipment on virtually all new vehicles sold
in western Europe.

Electrohydraulic brakes (SBC)
SBC (Sensotronic Brake Control) represents 
a new generation of braking systems. Under
normal operating conditions, it has no me-
chanical link between the brake pedal and the
wheel cylinders. The SBC electrohydraulic sys-
tem detects the brake pedal travel electronically
using duplicated sensor systems and analyses
the sensor signals in an ECU. This method of 
operation is sometimes referred to as“brake by
wire”. The hydraulic modulator controls the
pressure in the individual brakes by means of
solenoid valves. Operation of the brakes is
still effected hydraulically using brake fluid as
the transmission medium.

Electromechanical brakes (EMB)
In the future there will be another electronic
braking system, EMB (Electromechanical
Brakes), which will operate electromechani-
cally rather than employing hydraulics.  Elec -
tric motors will force the brake pads against
the discs in order to provide the braking
 action. The link between the brake pedal and
the brakes will be purely electronic.

Car braking systems

History of the brake

History of the brake

Origin and development
The first use of the wheel is dated to
5,000 B.C. Usually, cattle were used as draft
animals; later, horses and donkeys were also
used. The invention of the wheel made it
necessary to invent the brake. After all, a
horse-drawn carriage traveling downhill had
to be slowed down, not only to keep its
speed within controllable limits, but also to
prevent it running into the back of the
horses. This was likely done using wooden
rods braced against the ground or the wheel
disks. Beginning around 700 B.C., wheels ac-
quired iron tires to prevent premature wear
of the wheel rim. 

Beginning in 1690, coach drivers used a
“chock” to brake their carriages. While
 driving downhill, they used its handle push

it under a wheel, which then was immobi-
lized and slid onto the chock.

In 1817, at the dawn of the industrial age,

Baron Karl Drais rode from Karlsruhe in
southern Germany to Kehl, proving to a
stunned public that it is possible to ride on
two wheels without falling over. As he surely
had difficulty stopping when driving down-
hill, his last, 1820 model featured a friction
brake on the rear wheel (Fig. 1).

Finally, in 1850, the iron axle was intro-
duced in carriage construction, along with
the shoe brake. In this type of brake, brake
shoes were pressed against the metallic run-
ning surface of the iron-coated wooden
wheels. The shoe brake could be operated
from the driver’s seat with the aid of a crank
handle and a gear linkage (Fig. 2).

The low speed and sluggish drive train of
the first automobiles did not place any great
demands on the effectiveness of the brakes.
In the early days, the shoe, band and wedge
brakes, which were manually or foot-oper-
ated using levers, hinges and cables on the
fixed rear axles, were sufficient for this
 purpose. 

At first, the rear wheels were braked; occa-
sionally, an intermediate shaft or only the
cardan shaft was braked. Only about 35 years
after the automobile was invented were the
front wheels equipped with (cable-operated)
brakes. Even more years passed before
 automobiles began to be equipped with
 hydraulically operated brakes, which, at the
time, were only drum brakes. Use of the old
method of cable activation continued in a
few models, such as the VW Beetle, until
 after World War II. Other important mile-
stones were the use of disk brakes and, in the
present era, the introduction and incremen-
tal development of various driving stability
systems.

History of the brake

Shoe and external shoe brakes on the
wheel running surfaces
The first motor vehicles drove on wooden
wheels with steel or rubber tires, or rubber-
tired, spoked steel wheels. For braking, levers
(as for the horse-drawn carriages) pushed
brake shoes or external shoe brakes with
friction linings against the running surfaces
of the rear wheels. An initial example is the
“riding carriage” developed by Gottlieb
Daimler as an experimental vehicle in 1885
(the first motorcycle, with an engine perfor-
mance of 0.5 horsepower and a top speed of
12 km/h). A cable led from the brake actuat-

ing lever, located at the front, close to the
steering arm, to the external shoe brake on
the rear wheel (Figures 3a, b).

In 1886, the first passenger cars with internal
combustion engines were introduced: the
Daimler motor carriage (1.1 hp, 16 km/h),
which was derived from the horse carriage,
and the Benz motorcar, which was newly de-
signed as an automobile. Both of them had
shoe brakes, as did the world’s first truck,
built in 1896. The shoe brake was installed
in front of the rear wheels of each vehicle
(Figures 3c, d, e, f.).

Band and external shoe brakes
As solid rubber tires quickly became estab-
lished for motor vehicles (beginning with
the triangular Benz motorcar in 1886 and
the Daimler steel-wheeled car of 1889) and
were soon replaced by air-filled rubber tires
for a more comfortable ride, the era of the
shoe brake in automobiles had already come
to an end. 

From then on, band brakes (flexible steel
brake bands that braked either directly or
via several brake shoes riveted to the inside)
or external shoe brakes (rigid cast iron or
steel brake shoes with brake linings) began
to be used. These pedal-operated brakes
worked with external brake drums that were
normally installed at the front on the inter-
mediate drive shaft or on the drive axle in
the rear wheel area. 

For example, the Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach
produced the first Wartburg motorcar in
1898. Model 1 featured an exposed trans-
mission and drive pinions. Band brakes
braked both the axle drive and the two rear
wheels.

In 1899, the Daimler steel-wheeled car had
solid rubber tires and steel band brakes on
the rear wheels (Fig. 4). The Daimler
“Phoenix”, also dating from 1899, still had
solid rubber tires, but these were soon re-
placed by air-filled tires. A footbrake acted 
as an external shoe brake on the front drive
shaft (Figures 5 and 6), and the handbrake
acted on the rear wheels. In addition, this
car featured – as did, for example, the Benz
racing car of 1899 (Fig. 7) – a “sprag brake”,
a strong rod mounted on the rear that had
the purpose of being driven into the (usually
relatively soft) road.

 depressing the left foot pedal, which acts as 
a band brake on the brake disks fastened 
to the two rear wheels. Simultaneously, as
 mentioned above, the belt is automatically
moved out. To stop the car immediately,
both the left and the right pedals are de-
pressed at the same time, which causes the
band brake connected to the right pedal to
act on the brake disk and thus brake the
 reduction gear.”

Internal shoe drum brakes with 
mechanical cable activation
Over time, vehicles became faster and heav-
ier. Therefore, they required a more effective
brake system. Thus band and external shoe
brakes soon gave way to the internal shoe
drum brake, for which Louis Renault ap-
plied for a patent in 1902. A spreading
mechanism pushed two crescent-shaped
brake shoes against the inner surface of the
cast iron or steel brake drums, which were
connected to the wheel. Due to its self-rein-
forcing effect, the drum brake features low
operating forces compared to the braking
forces, long maintenance periods and long-
lasting linings.

At first, the braking force was transmitted 
to the two drum brakes of the rear wheels
 using brake cables.

For example, the Mercedes Simplex already
featured additional, cable-operated rear
wheel drum brakes (Fig. 8) in addition to the
cardan shaft band brake. Due to higher en-
gine performance (40 horsepower), a second
footbrake (Fig. 9) was added, which also
acted as a band brake on the intermediate
shaft of the chain drive. By the way, all four
brakes were cooled by a water spray which,
during braking, dripped onto the friction
surfaces from a reservoir.

Beginning in about 1920, vehicles were fitted
with drum brakes on all four wheels. The
braking force was still transmitted using
 mechanical means, i.e. levers, joints and
brake cables.

34

Car braking systems

History of the brake

These cable-operated drum brakes remained
in use for a long time. One example was
the standard VW model of the 1950s
(Fig. 10): 

The primary element of this brake system
was a brake pressure rail (Item 1). The four
brake cables (2) attached to this element 
ran backwards through cable sleeves to the
wheel brakes (drum brakes) of the four
wheels (3). The rear part of the rail was sup-
ported by a short lever that sat on the brake
pedal shaft. When the brake pedal of the
footbrake (4) was depressed, the brake pres-
sure rail was pushed forwards along with the
four cables. The cables transmitted the force
to the wheel brakes. 

The lever for the handbrake (5) was fur-
ther back in the car. However, via a decou-
pled rod, the handbrake ultimately acted on
the same mechanism as the footbrake, and
thus likewise acted on all four wheels.

Hydraulic brake activation
The main problem of the cable brake was
the great maintenance effort and the uneven
braking effect caused by uneven friction
during mechanical transmission. 

This was remedied when Lockheed intro-

duced a hydraulically actuated brake in
1919. A special brake fluid now transmitted
the brake pedal force uniformly to the actu-
ating cylinders of the wheel brakes over
metal lines and hoses, without the need for
levers, joints and cables. 

Hydraulic brake activation also made it pos-
sible to amplify the foot pressure applied by
the driver by using intake manifold depres-
sion as a source of power for a brake servo
system. The principle was patented in 1919
by Hispano-Suiza.

On commercial vehicles and railway rolling
stock, air brakes established themselves as
the system of choice.

In 1926, the “Adler Standard” was the first
car in Europe to be equipped with a hy-
draulic brake system. The first hydraulic
braking force reinforcement in auto racing
were used in the Mercedes-Benz “Silver
 Arrows” in 1954. This ultimately became
standard equipment for many mass-produc-
tion vehicles.

Because a possible failure of the brake cir-
cuit could completely disable the early sin-
gle-circuit brakes, the dual-circuit brake was
later prescribed by law. According to VW
Golf developer Dr. Ernst Fiala, the early
“Beetles” (the standard model VWs) still had
a cable-operated brake for that very reason:
at the time it was feared that a hose in the
hydraulic brakes could explode. Later, how-
ever – if only for competitive reasons – the
VW Export and VW Transporter featured
hydraulic braking systems.

Car braking systems

History of the brake

Disk brake
Although British automaker Lancaster had
patented the disk brake in 1902, it was a long
time until this type of brake was introduced.
Not until some fifty years later, beginning in
1955, did the legendary Citroën DS-19 be-
come the first mass-produced car to be fitted
with disk brakes. The disk brake was derived
from the multi-plate brake and was initially
developed for the aircraft industry. 

In the disk brake, one brake lining presses

the brake disk from the inside and outside.
The brake disk (which is normally made of
cast iron or, less commonly, of steel) is con-
nected to the wheel. Its advantage is its sim-
ple and easy-to-assemble structure. It also
counteracts the reduction in braking effect
caused by overheating and prevents mis-
alignment of the wheels of an axle.

The first German car with disk brakes on the
front wheels was the BMW 502 in 1959. The
first German cars to have disk brakes on all
four wheels were the Mercedes 300 SE, the
Lancia Flavia and the Fiat 2300 in 1961.
 Today, virtually all cars have a disk braking
system, at least on the front wheels. In 1974,
the first Formula 1 racecars with carbon
fiber composite brake disks were introduced.
These disks are considered especially light
and heat resistant and thus have gained
widespread use in motorsports and aviation.

Brake pads and shoes
Suitable brake linings had to be developed
for drum and disk brakes, for which asbestos
proved to be particularly effective. Not until
it became known that asbestos fibers were
harmful to health was the material replaced
by plastic fiber.

Driving stability systems
The age of electronic brake systems dawned
in 1978 with the arrival of the antilock brak-
ing system (ABS) for cars developed by
Bosch. During braking, ABS provides early
detection of the incipient lock of one or
more wheels and prevents wheel locking.
It ensures the steerability of the vehicle and

substantially reduces the danger of skidding.
In 1986, it was followed by the traction
 control system (TCS) with which Bosch
 extended system capability to the control
of wheel spin under acceleration. 
Fig. 11 shows road tests of these systems on
the Bosch proving grounds in Boxberg in
southern Germany.

As a further improvement of driving safety,
Bosch introduced the electronic stability
program (ESP) in 1995, which integrates the
functions of ABS and TCS. It not only pre-
vents the vehicle wheels from locking and
spinning, it also keeps the vehicle from
pulling to the side. Alternative systems, such
as four-wheel steering and rear-axle kine-
matics, which were developed in the 1980s
and 90s and were installed in some mass-
production vehicles, did not catch on be-
cause they weighed too much, cost too much
or were not effective enough.

Meanwhile, the (electrohydraulic) sen-
sotronic brake control has found its place in
automobile construction. It provides all of
the ESP functions and decouples the me-
chanical operation of the brake pedal by
means of an electronic control system. For
safety purposes, a hydraulic fallback system
is automatically available.

Car braking systems

Classification of car braking systems

Classification of 
car braking systems

The entirety of the braking systems on a
 vehicle is referred to as braking equipment.
Car braking systems can be classified on the
basis of
(cid:0) design and
(cid:0) method of operation

Designs
Based on legal requirements, the functions of
the braking equipment are shared among three
braking systems:
(cid:0) the service brakes,
(cid:0) the secondary-brake system, and
(cid:0) the parking brake

On commercial vehicles, the braking equip-
ment also includes a continuous-operation
braking system (e.g. retarder) that allows the
driver to keep the vehicle at a steady speed on
a long descent. The braking equipment of a
commercial vehicle also includes an auto-
matic braking system that operates the brakes
of a trailer if it is detached from its towing ve-
hicle either deliberately or by accident.

Service brakes
The service-brake system (“foot brake”) is used
to slow down the vehicle, to keep its speed
constant on a descent, or to bring it com-
pletely to a halt. 

The driver can infinitely vary the braking
 effect by means of the pressure applied to the
brake pedal. 
The service-brake system applies the brakes on
all four wheels.

Secondary-brake system
The secondary-brake system must be capable
of providing at least some degree of braking if
the service-brake system fails. It must be pos-
sible to infinitely vary the level of braking ap-
plied.

The secondary-brake system does not have to
be an entirely separate third braking system (in
addition to the service brakes and the parking
brake) with its own separate actuation device.
It can consist of the remaining intact circuit
of a dual-circuit service-brake system on
which one circuit has failed, or it can be a
parking-brake that is capable of graduated
application. 

Parking-brake system
The parking brake (hand brake) performs the
third function required of the braking equip-
ment. It must prevent the vehicle from mov-
ing when stopped or parked, even on a gradi-
ent and when the vehicle is unattended. 

According to the legal requirements, the
parking-brake system must also have an un-
broken mechanical link, e.g. a rod linkage or a
cable, between the actuation device and the
brakes that it operates. 

The parking-brake system is generally
 operated by means of a hand-brake lever posi-
tioned near the driver’s seat, or in some cases
by a foot pedal. This means that the service
and parking-brake systems of a motor vehicle
have separate actuation devices and means of
force transmission.

The parking-brake system is capable of grad-
uated application and operates the brakes on
one pair of wheels (front or rear) only.

Methods of operation
Depending on whether they are operated en-
tirely or partially by human effort or by an-
other source of energy, braking systems can
be classed either as 
(cid:0) muscular-energy (unassisted) braking

Power-brake systems
Power-brake systems are generally used on
commercial vehicles but are occasionally fitted
on large cars in conjunction with an integral
ABS facility. This type of braking system is
operated entirely without muscular-energy. 

 systems, 

(cid:0) power-assisted braking systems, or 
(cid:0) power-brake systems, 

Muscular-energy braking systems
On this type of braking system frequently
found on cars and motorcycles, the effort ap-
plied to the brake pedal or hand-brake lever is
transmitted to the brakes either mechanically
(by means of a rod linkage or cable) or hy-
draulically. The energy by which the braking
force is generated is produced entirely by the
physical strength of the driver.

Power-assisted braking systems
The power-assisted braking system is the type
most commonly used on cars and light com-
mercial vehicles. 
It amplifies the force applied by the driver by
means of a brake servo which utilises another
source of energy (vacuum or hydraulic power).
The amplified muscle power is transmitted
hydraulically to the brakes. 

The system is operated by hydraulic power
(which is based on fluid pressure) transmitted
by hydraulic means. The brake fluid is stored
in energy accumulators (hydraulic accumula-
tors) which also contain a compressed gas
(usually nitrogen). The gas and the fluid are
kept apart by a flexible diaphragm (diaphragm
accumulator) or a piston with a rubber seal
(piston accumulator). A hydraulic pump gen-
erates the fluid pressure, which is always in
equilibrium with the gas pressure in the en-
ergy accumulator. A pressure regulator
switches the hydraulic pump to idle as soon
as the maximum pressure is reached. 

Since brake fluid can be regarded as practically
incompressible, small volumes of brake fluid
can transmit large brake-system pressures. 

38

Car braking systems

Components of a car braking system

Components of a car braking
system

Figure 1 shows the schematic layout of a car
braking system. It consists of the following
main component groups: 
(cid:0) Energy supply system,
(cid:0) Actuation device, 
(cid:0) Force transmission system, and
(cid:0) Wheel brakes.

Energy supply system
The energy supply system encompasses those
parts of the braking system that provide, con-
trol and (in some cases) condition the energy
required to operate the brakes. It ends at the
point where the force transmission  system be-
gins, i.e. where the various circuits of the
braking system are isolated from the energy
supply system or from each other. 

Car braking systems are in the main power-
assisted braking systems in which the physical
effort of the driver, amplified by the vacuum
in the brake servo unit, provides the energy
for braking. 

Actuation device
The actuation device encompasses those parts
of a braking system that are used to initiate
and control the action of that braking system.
The control signal may be transmitted within
the actuation device, and the use of an addi-
tional energy source is also possible. 

The actuation device starts at the point at
which the actuation force is directly applied.
It may be operated in the following ways: 
(cid:0) by direct application of force by hand or

foot by the driver, 

(cid:0) by indirect control of force by the driver. 

The actuation device ends at the point where
distribution of the braking-system energy be-
gins or where a portion of that energy is di-
verted for the purpose of controlling braking.
Among the essential components of the actu-
ation device are the vacuum servo unit and
the master cylinder. 

Force transmission system
The force transmission system encompasses
those parts of the braking system that trans mit
the energy introduced by the energy supply sys-
tem(s) and controlled by the actuation de-
vice. It starts at the point where the actuation
device and the energy supply system end. It
ends at the point where it interfaces with
those parts of the braking system that generate
the forces that inhibit or retard vehicle motion.
It may be mechanical or hydromechanical in
design. 

The components of the force transmission

system include the transmission medium,
hoses, pipes and, on some systems, a pressure
regulating valve for limiting the braking force
at the rear wheels. 

Wheelbrakes
The wheelbrakes consist of those parts of the
braking system in which the forces that in-
hibit or retard the movement of the vehicle
are generated. On car braking systems, they
are friction brakes (disc or drum brakes).

Brake-circuit configuration

39

Brake-circuit configuration

Legal requirements demand that braking sys-
tems incorporate a dual-circuit forcetrans-
mission system. 

HI configuration 
This layout involves a front/front-and-rear
split - one brake circuit operates the front and
rear brakes, the other operates only the front
brakes. 

LL configuration 
This arrangement involves a two-front/one-
rear split. Each circuit operates both front
wheels and one rear wheel. 

HH configuration 
The circuits are split front-and-rear/front-
and-rear. Each circuit operates all four wheels.

1

Brake-circuit configuration

According to DIN 74 000, there are five ways
in which the two brake circuits can be split
(Figure 1). It uses the following combinations
of letters to designate the five different con-
figurations: II, X, HI, LL and HH. Those let-
ters are chosen because their shapes roughly
approximate to the layout of the brake lines
connecting the master cylinder and the brakes.
Of those five possibilities, the II and X con-

figurations, which involve the minimum
amount of brake piping, hoses, disconnectable
joints and static or dynamic seals, have become
the most widely established. That characteris-
tic means that the risk of failure of each of
the individual circuits due to fluid leakage is
as low as it is for a single-circuit braking sys-
tem. In the event of brake-circuit failure due
to overheating of one of the brakes, the HI,
LL and HH configurations have a critical
weakness because the connection of individual
brakes to both circuits means that failure of
one brake can result in total failure of the
braking system as a whole. 

In order to satisfy the legal requirements
 regarding secondary-braking effectiveness,
vehicles with a forward weight-distribution
bias are fitted with the X configuration. The II
configuration is particularly suited to use on
cars with a rearward weight-distribution bias. 

II configuration 
This layout involves a front-axle/rear-axle
split – one circuit operates the rear brakes, the
other operates the front brakes. 

X configuration 
This layout involves a diagonal split – each
circuit operates one front brake and its diago-
nally opposed rear brake.

Car braking-system components

Overview

Car braking-system components

into the brake pipes (4) and brake hoses (2),
thereby transmitting hydraulic pressure to the
disk brakes (1) on the front wheels and the
drum brakes (12) on the rear wheels. If one of
the brake circuits fails, the other remains fully
functional so that the effect of a secondary-
brake system is guaranteed. The brake-fluid
reservoir (6) connected to the master cylinder
(5) compensates for volume fluctuations in
the brake circuits.

Increasing deceleration during the braking
process shifts an increasingly larger proportion
of the vehicle’s weight from the rear to the
front wheels (dynamic axle-load shift).
 Accordingly, the pressure regulating valve (11)
lowers the braking pressure at the rear wheels
to prevent them being overbraked. This is a
brake-force balancing process rather than a
brake-force control process such as is effected
by antilock braking systems.

The parking-brake system linked to the rear

brakes (12) is operated by the hand-brake
lever (9) and the hand-brake cable (10).

Along with steering and changing gear, brak-
ing is one of the most frequently performed
operations when driving a car.
The components of the braking system must
take account of that fact by making optimum
use of the force applied to the pedal by the
driver and by ensuring that the force required
remains as constant as possible for the desired
braking effect.

Overview

Figure 1 shows a conventional braking system
of the dual-circuit type with a front/rear con  fig -
uration and without electronic safety systems.
In order to operate the brakes, the driver
applies foot pressure to the brake pedal (8),
thereby moving the connecting rod which joins
it to the piston of the brake servo unit (7).
The brake servo unit amplifies the force ap-
plied by the driver and transmits the amplified
force to the push-rod connected to the master
cylinder (6). The master cylinder converts the
mechanical force from the push-rod into hy -
draulic pressure. The two pistons in the master
cylinder force brake fluid (hydraulic fluid)
out of the master cylinder pressure chambers

Brake pedal

Function
During the braking sequence, the force 
applied by the driver is transmitted to the
braking system through the brake-pedal. 
This requires a sensitive response to the 
force applied.

Design
There are two types of brake-pedal design:
(cid:1) suspended and
(cid:1) floor-mounted (brake-pedal module).

Suspended design
Most cars have suspended-type brake pedals
(Figure1). Thepedal(7)isattachedtothepedal
mount (5) through its spindle (6). A return
spring (3) attached to the front bulkhead (2)
holds the brake pedal in the neutral position
when it is not being operated.

Brake-pedal module
On the brake-pedal module (Figure 2), 
the pedal (3), brake servo unit (2) and master
cylinder (1) are combined to form a single
unit. Design considerations dictate that the
module illustrated is mounted below the
 vehicle floor in the area of the driver’s footwell.
A sealed casing (4) protects the mechanism
from dirt and damp.

Method of operation
During the braking sequence, the driver applies
foot pressure to the pedal (Item 7, Figure 1),
thereby overcoming the retaining force of the
return spring (3) and transmitting force to the
brake servo unit (1) via the connecting rod (4).

Car braking-system components

Brake servo unit

Brake servo unit

The brake servo unit amplifies the force applied
by the driver’s foot when pressing the brake
pedal and thus reduces the effort required. 
It is combined with the master cylinder to
form a single unit and is a component of the
majority of car braking systems.A fundamental
technical requirement demanded of brake
servo units is that they reduce the physical 
effort required of the driver without impairing
the response sensitivity of the braking system
and the feedback on the level of braking. The
two common designs of brake servo unit, the
vacuum servo unit and the hydraulic servo
unit, utilise existing sources of energy in the
vehicle – the vacuum in the intake manifold
or the hydraulic pressure generated by a hy-
draulic pump.

Dual-chamber vacuum servo unit
Most cars are fitted with a brake servo unit of
the vacuum type. There are two versions of
this type of unit which both function in a
similar manner:
(cid:1) the dual-chamber type (Figure 1) and 
(cid:1) the four-chamber tandem type (Figure 2)

for greater power assistance.

Function
Vacuum brake servo units utilise the negative
pressure generated in the intake manifold
during the induction stroke on gasoline en-
gines or the vacuum (0.5 ... 0.9 bar) produced
by a vacuum pump on diesel engines to am-
plify the force applied by the driver’s foot.
The level of power assistance increases pro-
portionally to the foot pressure until the “sat-
uration point” is reached. This is close to the
locking pressure for the front wheels and may
be between 60 and 100 bar depending on the
vehicle. From that point onwards, the level 
of power assistance does not increase any 
further.

Car braking-system components

Brake servo unit

43

Design
A diaphragm (Item 4, Figure 1) separates the
vacuum chamber (3) with its vacuum pipe
connection from the working chamber (12).
The connecting rod (10) transmits the applied
foot pressure to the working piston (5) and
the amplified force is passed to the master
cylinder via the push rod (1).

Method of operation
When the brakes are not being applied, the
vacuum chamber (3) and working chamber
(12) are connected to one another via channels
in the valve body (8). Given that the vacuum
pipe connection (3) is connected to a vacuum
source, this means that there is a vacuum in
both chambers.

As soon as a braking sequence is initiated,
the connecting rod (10) moves in the direction
of the vacuum chamber (3) and presses the
seal of the double valve (7) against the valve
seat (11). Consequently, the vacuum chamber
and working chamber are then isolated from
each other. Since further movement of the
connecting rod lifts the sensing piston (6)
away from the double-valve seal, air at atmos-
pheric pressure is able to flow into the working
chamber. The pressure in the working cham -

2

Four-chamber/tandem vacuum servo unit

ber is then greater than in the vacuum chamber.
The atmospheric pressure acts via the dia -
phragm (4) on the diaphragm disk with which
it is in contact. Because the diaphragm disk 
is attached to the valve body (8), the latter
moves when the disk moves, thereby assisting
the foot pressure transmitted by the connecting
rod. The foot pressure and the assisting force
thus combine to overcome the force of the
compression spring (2) and move the push
rod (1) forwards, thereby transmitting the
output force of the servo unit to the master
cylinder.

When the brake pedal is released and brak-
ing ceases, the vacuum chamber and working
chamber are connected again so that there is
a vacuum in both.

Four-chamber/tandem vacuum servo unit
Function
Like the dual-chamber vacuum servo unit,
the four-chamber/tandem version uses vac-
uum to amplify the foot pressure applied to
the brake pedal by the driver. The four-cham-
ber design allows greater power assistance to be
achieved than with the dual-chamber version.

Car braking-system components

Brake servo unit

Design
There are four chambers – working chamber I
(previous page, Figure 2, Item 15), vacuum
chamber I (5), working chamber II (16) and
vacuum chamber II (3) – arranged in series,
one behind the other. Between vacuum cham-
ber I and working chamber II there is a parti-
tion (6). The connecting rod (13) transmits
the applied foot pressure to the working
 piston (8) and the amplified force is passed to
the master cylinder via the push rod (1).

Method of operation
The method of operation is similar to that of
the dual-chamber vacuum servo unit. When
the brakes are not being applied, there is a
vacuum in all four chambers, given that the
vacuum pipe connection (3) is connected 
to a vacuum source. As soon as a braking se-
quence is initiated, the sensing piston (9) lifts
away from the seal of the double valve (10).
Air at atmospheric pressure is then able to
enter working chambers I (15) and II (16)
thus creating a pressure difference between
the working chambers and the vacuum
chambers. That pressure difference acts as an
assisting force and amplifies the foot pressure
transmitted via the connecting rod.

Vacuum non-return valve

Vacuum non-return valve
All braking systems equipped with a vacuum
servo unit have a non-return valve (Figure 3)
in the vacuum pipe between the vacuum
source (engine intake manifold or vacuum
pump) and the vacuum servo unit. While
there is a vacuum present, the non-return
valve remains open. It closes when the vacuum
source ceases to produce a vacuum (engine is
switched off) so that the vacuum inside the
brake servo unit is retained. On gasoline-en-
gined cars, it also prevents fuel vapours being
drawn into the brake servo unit and damaging
rubber components. The throttle effect of the
valve also attenuates the pulsations generated
by the intake manifold.

Note on fitting
The vacuum non-return valve must be fitted
in the vacuum pipe so that the arrow points
towards thevacuumsource (engineintake man-
ifold or vacuum pump).
If it is fitted the wrong way round it will not
function as intended. It is fitted near to the
engine intake manifold but not so close that
the heat from the engine impairs its function.

Hydraulic brake servo system
A hydraulic brake servo system (Figure 4) is
used on vehicles that are fitted with a means
of generating hydraulic power (e.g. a power
steering system) and have an engine that only
produces a small level of vacuum in the intake
manifold (e.g. diesel or turbocharged engine).
As part of such a system, the hydraulic brake
servo unit (Page 33, Fig. 4, Item 7) occupies
significantly less space and has a higher output
pressure (approx. 160 bar) than a vacuum
servo unit.

Notes on use
(cid:1) Hydraulic oil is used in the brake servo cir-
cuit (A), the intake and return lines (B)
and the power-steering circuit (C). 

(cid:1) Brake fluid is used in the brake circuits (D).

Brake servo unit

Function
Hydraulic brake servo units amplify the force
applied to the brake pedal by the driver when
braking. They use hydraulic power that is 
generated by a hydraulic pump and stored 
in a hydraulic accumulator.

Design
The hydraulic brake servo system consists of
the following components:
(cid:1) Steering pump (1) 
(cid:1) Reservoir (2) with filter 
(cid:1) Pressure-controlled flow regulator (3) with

hydraulic accumulator (4) 

(cid:1) Master cylinder (5) with brake-fluid 

reservoir (6) 

The steering pump supplies the brake servo
unit (7) and the power steering system (8)
with hydraulic pressure.

4

Hydraulic brake servo system

Method of operation of flow regulator and
hydraulic accumulator 
The flow regulator and hydraulic accumulator
are identified by the numbers 3 and 4 in the
diagram of the system (Figure 4).

The steering pump delivers hydraulic fluid
to port C1 of the pressure-controlled flow reg-
ulator (Figure 5 overleaf, Items 1 ... 5). The
flow regulator piston (4) directs the majority
of the flow via port C2 to the power-steering
system, while the smaller proportion is used to
charge the hydraulic accumulator (6 ... 8) to a
pressure of 36 ... 57 bar. When its shut-off pres-
sure is reached, the changeover valve (5) con-
nects the spring chamber of the flow-regulator
piston (4) to the hydraulic reservoir via port B.
The entire hydraulic flow is then available to
the power-steering system.

Non-braking mode 
The control edges (Figure 6, Items 4 ... 6) 
block the inflow of hydraulic oil from the
pressure-controlled flow regulator via port
C2 while allowing unpressurised oil to flow
out of port B to the hydraulic oil reservoir.

Normal braking mode
The foot pressure applied by the driver is
transmitted to the actuating piston (9) which
moves the control piston (7), thereby shifting
its control edges. As a result, pressurised oil
from the pressure-controlled flow regulator 
is allowed to enter the servo via port C2 and
outflow of oil to the reservoir via port B is
blocked. The pressurised hydraulic oil acts on
the transfer piston (3) and the actuating pis-
ton (9) as an assisting force supplementing the
foot pressure applied by the driver until a
state of equilibrium is reached with the output
force from the master cylinder acting on the
push rod (1).

Emergency braking mode
The control edges (5, 6) are in such a position
that they allow totally unrestricted through-
flow of pressurised hydraulic oil. As a result,
the maximum degree of power assistance is
obtained.

Master cylinder

47

Master cylinder

The master cylinder (also called a tandem
master cylinder) converts the mechanical force
applied by the driver to the brake pedal – and
amplified by the brake servo where fitted –
into hydraulic brake force by forcing brake
fluid into the brake circuits in proportion to
the mechanical force applied and controlling
it accordingly.

Statutory regulations require that cars are
fitted with two separate brake circuits. That
requirement is accommodated by using a 
tandem-type master cylinder which consists
in effect of two master cylinders connected 
in series. If one of the brake circuits fails, full
braking pressure can then still be maintained
in the other circuit.

There are a number of possible variations on
the master-cylinder design, as described below.
Other specialised designs such as the gradu-
ated master cylinder, the multistage master
cylinder or the Twintax master cylinder are
only rarely used in motor vehicles.

Master cylinder with captive piston spring
Design
The “captive” piston spring (Figure 1, Item 9),
a compression spring, keeps the push-rod pis-
ton (11) and the float piston (7) – also called
the intermediate piston – the same distance
apart when the cylinder is at rest. This pre-
vents the piston spring (9) moving the float
piston to a position where its primary seal
(13) has passed beyond the balancing port (5)
when the cylinder is at rest. If that were to
happen, pressure equalisation in the sec-
ondary circuit via the balancing port (5) would
not be possible and residual pressure in the
circuit after release of the brakes would pre-
vent the brake shoes/pads from retracting
from the drum/disk. 

Method of operation
When the brakes are operated, the push-rod
piston (11) and the float piston (7) move to
the left, pass over the balancing ports (5) and
force brake fluid into the brake circuits via
the outlet ports (2). As the pressure increases,
the float piston ceases to be moved by the
captive piston spring (9) and is moved instead
by the pressure of the brake fluid.

Car braking-system components

Master cylinder

Method of operation
Theforceappliedtothebrakepedalactsdirectly
against the push-rod piston (14) and pushes it
to the left. This moves it past the balancing
port (11) and the fluid in the pressure cham-
ber (3) is then able to push the float piston (6)
to the left as well. Once the float piston has
moved about 1 mm to the left, the valve pin
(18) is no longer resting against the clamping
sleeve (7) and the valve seal (16) seals off the
pressure chamber (3) from the intermediate
chamber (9) by pressing against the float piston.
As the force applied to the brake pedal in-
creases, so the pressure in both pressure cham-
bers (3) rises. As the foot pressure is released,
the two pistons (14 and 6) move to the right
until the balancing port (11) is open again or
the valve pin (18) presses against the clamping
sleeve (7) and the valve seal (16) lifts away from
the float piston (6). The brake fluid can then
flow back into the fluid reservoir and the brakes
are no longer under pressure.

Master cylinder with central valve
Design
Basically, this type of master cylinder (Figure
2) is  similar to the master cylinder with cap-
tive piston spring described above. It was de-
veloped for vehicles with antilock braking
systems (ABS).

The particular feature of this master cylinder
is a float piston with an integral central valve
that allows the brake fluid to flow back
through the valve-pin channel (18) when the
braking system is not under pressure. The
balancing port in the secondary circuit is thus
dispensed with as the central valve performs
the same function. The intermediate chamber
(9) is permanently connected via a channel to
the brake-fluid reservoir. 
As there is a risk on vehicles fitted with ABS
that when the piston passes over the balanc-
ing port (11), damage to the primary seal
(17) can result at high pressures (leading to
failure of one of the brake circuits), master
cylinders on such vehicles are generally fitted
with two central valves.

Brake-fluid reservoir, pilot-pressure valve

49

Brake-fluid reservoir

Pilot-pressure valve

The brake-fluid reservoir is generally attached
directly to the master cylinder. It acts not only
as a reservoir for the brake fluid, but also as an
expansion vessel which accommodates volume
fluctuations in the brake circuits. These occur
when the brakes are released, or as a result of
brake-lining wear, temperature differences
within the braking system or when the ABS
or ESP systems are active. The brake-fluid
reservoir is connected to the master cylinder
by two outlets (Figure 3, Item 8).

The warning device for indicating when the
fluid level is low operates according to the float
principle. When the fluid level drops below
the minimum level, the float (5) completes
the electrical circuit of the warning device (1)
by means of the float switch (2) so that the
warning lamp (4) lights up.

Pilot-pressure valves maintain a pressure of
0.4 to 1.7 bar in hydraulic brake circuits in
order to ensure that the cup seals in the wheel
cylinders function properly. They are used 
instead of bottom valves and, if there is insuf-
ficient space in the master cylinder or if the
vehicle has both drum and disk brakes, are
fitted external to the master cylinder.

The ball valve shuts off the connection
 between the master cylinder and the wheel-
brake cylinders as soon as the pressure in the
master cylinder drops below the set level 
(Figure 4).

Pilot-pressure valves are superfluous on brak-
ing systems that incorporate the latest tech-
nological advances. That is because the seals
in the wheel cylinders function without having
to be under pressure.

Car braking-system components

Components for braking-force distribution

Components for braking-force
distribution

As a result of dynamic axle-load shift under
braking, more braking force can be applied to
the front wheels of a vehicle than to the rear
wheels. Consequently, the front brakes aremore
generously dimensioned than the rear brakes.
The reduction of the load on the rear axle isnot
alinearprogression,however,but advances at a
faster rate as deceleration increases. Onvehicles
with “invariable braking-force distribution”,
therefore, overbraking of either the front wheels
of the rear wheels will occur at some point de-
pending on the force-distribution setting.

Overbraking of the rear wheels has a nega-

tive effect on vehicle handling and can cause
skidding. By adopting appropriate measures
(fitting a rear-wheel pressure regulating valve),
however, the handling characteristics of the
vehicle can be positively influenced and the
actual braking force made to approximate
more closely to the ideal braking force  
(no wheel lock-up).
A distinction is made between
(cid:1) static or dynamic pressure regulating

valves, and 

(cid:1) pressure limiting valves.

With a pressure regulating valve, the rate of
pressure increase for the rear brakes is less
than that for the front brakes upwards of a
specific pressure (changeover pressure or

changeover point). Upwards of the change -
over point, static pressure regulating valves
regulate the brake pressure according to a
fixed characteristic, while dynamic pressure
regulating valves do so on the basis of a regu-
lating ratio that depends on the vehicle load
or the rate of deceleration.

Pressure regulating valves must be designed
in such a way that under practical conditions,
the braking force is distributed at a level well
below the ideal level. The effect of variations
in the frictional coefficient of the road sur-
face, the engine braking torque and the toler-
ance limits of the pressure regulating valve
must also be taken into account in order to
prevent rear-wheel lock-up.

The pressure limiting valve (described at
the end of this chapter) prevents the brake
pressure to the rear wheels rising any further
once a specific level (shut-off pressure) has
been reached.

Depending on the type of vehicle and the

braking system used by the manufacturer,
there are essentially five versions employed:
(cid:1) Fixed-setting pressure regulating valve,
(cid:1) Load-dependent pressure regulating valve,
(cid:1) Deceleration-dependent pressure regulating

valve,

(cid:1) Integral pressure regulating valve, and
(cid:1) Pressure limiting valve

Load-dependent pressure regulating valve
Vehicles whose payload can alter significantly
from one journey to the next require so-called
load-dependent pressure regulating valves
(Figure 3) so that the braking forces can be
adjusted according to the weight being carried.
This type of pressure regulating valve is at-
tached to the bodywork and connected to 
the vehicle’s rear axle (6) by means of a rod
linkage (5). The relative movement between
suspension and body as the springs are
compressed is transmitted to the graduated 
piston (1). The piston then compresses the
control springs (2) according to the amount
of suspension travel, thereby altering the
changeover point. This achieves an adaptive
response of the rear-axle brake pressure rela-
tive to the weight of the vehicle payload (Fig-
ure 4).

Fixed-setting pressure regulating valve
The pressure regulating valve (Figure 1) is fit-
ted in the rear-axle brake circuit. The valve
body (8) encloses a graduated piston (7) with
an integral valve (9). The output pressure is
reduced relative to the input pressure in pro-
portion to the ratio of the effective areas of
the annular chambers (2, 5).

When the brakes are applied, hydraulic
pressure from the master cylinder passes via
the inlet port (1), the annular chamber (2),
the channel (3) in the graduated piston (7)
and second annular chamber (5) to the outlet
port (4). Shortly before the changeover pres-
sure is reached, the pressure acting on the an-
nular-chamber effective area (2) pushes the
graduated piston to the right as far as the stop
so that the valve (9) closes off the channel to
the outlet port (4). As the pressure continues
to increase, the graduated piston moves
rapidly back and forth, opening and closing
the valve (9) accordingly, thereby regulating
the output pressure in proportion to the ratio
of the effective areas (2, 5). Once the braking
sequence ends, the pressure at the outlet port
(4) pushes the graduated piston (7) against
the compression spring (6) until the excess
pressure in the annular chambers (2, 5) has
reduced. Figure 2 shows the pressure curves.

Car braking-system components

Components for braking-force distribution

Deceleration-dependent pressure
 regulating valve
Installation
This type of pressure regulating valve must 
be fitted in the rear-axle brake circuit and 
set at an angle, α, to the vehicle’s horizontal
axis in such a way that when the vehicle is 
stationary, the ball (4) rests at the back of 
the valve away from the stepped piston 
(2, Figure 5). 

Design and method of operation
The main components of the valve are a
stepped piston (2) and a ball (4). As the brake
pressure required to obtain a given rate of de-
celeration depends on the weight being car-
ried by the vehicle, this type of valve is load-de-
pendent as well as deceleration-dependent.

As soon as the rate of deceleration under braking
reaches a certain level, the inertia of the ball
causes it to roll up the inclined plane – assisted
by the pressure from the inlet port (9) – and
close off the channel (8) through the stepped
piston (2). This point represents the first
changeover point (1 or 3, Figure 6) because
further increase of pressure at the inlet port
(9) cannot initially be passed through to the
rear-axle brake circuit (pressure limiter func-
tion). As the pressure at the inlet port (9) con-
tinues to increase, however, the stepped pis-
ton (2) is pushed forwards against the action
of the leaf spring (7) towards the outlet port
(1) and away from the ball. At that stage, the
second changeover point (2 or 4) has been
reached. The piston channel (8) has been
opened again and the passage of fluid between
the two ports (9 and 1) is possible again.The
pressure in the rear-axle brake circuit can now
rise again at a reduced rate (pressure regulat-
ing function).

Figure 6 shows the changeover points of a
deceleration-dependent pressure regulating
valve for an unladen and a fully laden vehicle.

Integral pressure regulating valve
This device operates in the same way as the
fixed-setting pressure regulating valve described
previously. Because of its light weight and small
dimensions (2), it can be integrated in the
master cylinder (1) by being screwed into the
rear-wheel brake circuit connection (Figure 7).

Braking-force limiter
The braking-force limiter (Figure 8) is fitted in
the rear-axle brake circuit and prevents the
rear-axle brake pressure rising beyond its
shut-off pressure. At that point, the valve pis-
ton (6) compresses the compression spring (5)
and brings the valve cone (4) into contact
with the valve seat (8) so that no further pres-
sure increase at the outlet port (9) is possible.
When the braking sequence comes to an end,
the valve opens and releases the pressure.

Reaction distance and total braking distance

According to ISO 611, the total braking distance is the
distance travelled during the total braking time (see
chapter “Basic principles of vehicle dynamics”, “Defini-
tions” section). Thus, the point at which the driver first
applies force to the actuation device is a decisive factor
in determining the total braking distance. However, as
far as the overall braking sequence is concerned, the
distance travelled from when the driver first identifies a
hazard to when the brakes are first applied is also of
significance. This is the driver’s reaction time and is dif-
ferent for every driver.

The total distance travelled from identification of a
hazard to the point at which the vehicle comes to a halt
is thus made up of a number of components consisting of
(cid:1) the distance travelled during the reaction time and the
brake-system response time at a constant velocity, υ,

(cid:1) the distance travelled during the brake-pressure

build-up time at an increasing rate of deceleration,

(cid:1) the distance travelled under fully developed deceler-

ation at a constant rate of deceleration.

Alternatively, half the period of increasing deceleration
can be taken to be under fully developed deceleration
at the rate a, and the remaining period taken to be under
zero deceleration. This time period is added to the other
periods of zero deceleration (reaction time and brake-
system response time) to form the dead time, tvz. Thus
the distance required for braking is defined by the formula
s = υ · tvz + υ2
–––2a

The maximum rate of deceleration is limited by the friction
between the tires and the road. Minimum rates of decel-
eration are defined by law.

Assuming a dead time of 1s, the table below shows
the combined reaction and total braking distance at var-
ious speeds.

Car braking-system components

Brake pipes and hoses

Brake pipes

Brake hoses

Function
Brake pipes are rigid metal pipes that carry
brake fluid from the master cylinder to the
brakes and normally run underneath the
bodywork. The photograph in Figure 1 shows
the routing of brake pipes and brake hoses in
the area of the front suspension.

Design
Rigid brake pipes are made of steel (normally
with an external diameter of 4.5 mm and an
internal diameter of 2.5) and are often pro-
tected on the outside by a plastic corrosion-
proof coating. Both ends of a length of pipe
are flared and are connected to other compo-
nents by appropriate unions.

Usage
When routing brake pipes, care must be taken
to ensure that, apart from at the intended fix-
ing points, the pipes are not in contact with the
body or any other components.

Function
Brake hoses form a flexible link between the
brake pipes that are rigidly attached to the
bodywork and the brakes, which are attached
to the suspension/wheel hubs and therefore
subject to movement.

Design
Flexible brake hoses consist of an inner layer
of rubber, two rayon reinforcing layers (for
withstanding the fluid pressure), an outer
rubber coating and the fittings (unions).

Usage
The lengths and usages of flexible brake hoses
are set down in specifications that in some
cases are specific to particular vehicles. In
general, the regulations require that the brake
hoses are not permitted to come into contact
with suspension or body components and
that the specified temperature and pressure
ranges are not exceeded.

Brake fluid

55

Viscosity
In order to ensure efficient and reliable oper-
ation of the brakes over a wide range of tem-
peratures (-40 °C...+100 °C), the brake fluid’s
viscosity should have the minimum-possible
degree of dependence on temperature. This is
particularly important on ABS systems.

Warning: 

All brake fluids apart
from DOT5 (silicone-
based) are harmful to the
skin and corrosive to
paint.

Brake fluid

Brake fluid is the hydraulic medium employed
to transmit actuation forces within the braking
system. The applicable quality requirements
are set down in the standards SAE J 1703,
FMVSS 116, ISO 4925, and Table 1 below.

Requirements
Equilibrium boiling point
The equilibrium boiling point provides an 
index of the brake fluid’s resistance to thermal
stress. Thermal stress can be particularly high
in the wheel cylinders (this is where the highest
temperatures in the braking system occur). At
temperatures above the brake fluid’s momen-
tary boiling point, vapour bubbles are pro-
duced. If that occurs, operation of the brakes
is no longer possible.

Wet boiling point
The wet boiling point is the brake fluid’s equi-
librium boiling point after it has absorbed wa-
ter under defined conditions. On hygro-
scopic (glycol-based) fluids in particular, the
effect is a substantial lowering of the boiling
point.

The purpose of testing the wet boiling point
is to determine the properties of used brake
fluid, which can absorb water primarily by
diffusion through the brake hoses. This is the
main reason why it is necessary to replace the
brake fluid in a vehicle every 1 ... 2 years. This
is absolutely essential for the safety of the
braking system, which must always be bled
afterwards.

Compressibility
The compressibility of the fluid must be small
and its temperature-dependence as low as
possible.

Non-corrosiveness
According to FMVSS 116, brake fluid must not
be corrosive to the metals normally used in
braking systems. This can only be achieved by
the use additives.

Elastomer swelling
The elastomers used in a braking system must
be matched to the particular type of brake
fluid employed. A small amount of elastomer
swelling is desirable. However, it must not
under any circumstances exceed 16 %, as 
otherwise the strength of the components 
will be impaired. Even small amounts of con-
tamination of a glycol-based brake fluid with
mineral oils (mineral-oil-based brake fluid,
solvent) can result in damage to rubber com-
ponents (such as seals) and consequently to
brake failure.

Chemical composition
Although alteration of the chemical composi-
tion may improve one of the properties
 referred to above, it normally brings about
changes to others at the same time.

Wheel brakes

Overview

Wheel brakes

There are two types of brake used on cars –
disk brakes and drum brakes. New cars are
now fitted exclusively with disk brakes at the
front, and there is an increasing trend to-
wards disk brakes for the rear wheels as well.
Both types are friction brakes in which the
braking energy transmitted by the braking
system acts by pressing the brake pads or
shoes against the brake disks/drums.

Overview

Requirements
The demands placed on the brakes are
 extremely exacting and include:
(cid:1) short braking distance,
(cid:1) fast response time,
(cid:1) short pressure build-up time
(cid:1) even braking effect,
(cid:1) precise control,
(cid:1) Insusceptibility to dirt 

and corrosion,
(cid:1) high reliability,
(cid:1) durability,
(cid:1) resistance to wear,
(cid:1) ease of maintenance.

In order to be able to meet those requirements
while remaining acceptably economical, in Eu-
rope small cars and some medium-sized cars
are fitted with disk brakes on the front wheels
and drum brakes on the rear (drum brakes 
represent a cost saving). The more expensive
mid-range cars, as well as executive/luxury
and sports cars have disk brakes all round.

This is because of the fact that the heavier
weights and higher speeds of those vehicles
are such that only disk brakes are capable of
coping with the levels of heat generated. Con-
sequently, particular attention has to be paid
to
(cid:1) heat conduction,
(cid:1) brake ventilation and
(cid:1) stable frictional properties of the brake pads.

Assessment of brakes
The brake coefficient C* is used as an assess-
ment criterion for brake performance, and in-
dicates the ratio of braking force to application
force. It takes account of the effect of internal
force transmission (ratio of input to output
force) within the brake and of the frictional
coefficient, which is chiefly dependent on the
parameters speed, braking pressure and tem-
perature. Figure 1 shows the brake coefficient
for various types of brake.

Bosch test center at Boxberg

An important component of the development
process for vehicle systems are the practical
trials performed by the system supplier. Not 
all tests can be carried out on public roads.
Since 1998 Bosch has performed this part 
of the development process at its test center
near Boxberg between Heilbronn and
Würzburg (south Germany). The 92-hectare
site provides facilities for testing all conceiv-
able handling, safety and convenience sys-
tems and components to the limit. Seven
 different sections of test track allow systems
to be tested to their physical limits under all
types of road conditions and driving situations
– and under the safest possible conditions for
the test drivers and vehicles.

The rough-surface sections (1) are designed
for speeds of up to 50 km/h and 100 km/h
 respectively. The following types of surface
are provided:  
(cid:1) pot holes
(cid:1) undulations
(cid:1) high-vibration surface
(cid:1) cobblestones, and
(cid:1) variable-surface sections.

The asphalted gradient sections (2) for  
hill-start and uphill acceleration testing with
gradients of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% include
sprayable, paved sections of various widths. 

There are two ford sections (3) with lengths
of 100 meters and 30 meters respectively and
depths of 0.3 and 1 meter. 
There are special sprayed sections (4) with
the following surfaces: 
(cid:1) “chessboard” (asphalt and paving slabs)
(cid:1) asphalt
(cid:1) paving slabs
(cid:1) blue basalt
(cid:1) concrete
(cid:1) an aquaplaning section and
(cid:1) a trapezium-shaped blue-basalt section

The skid pan (5) for testing cornering charac-
teristics has an asphalt surface 300 meters in
diameter. Parts of it can be watered to simu-
late ice and wet roads. It is surrounded by a
safety barrier made of tires in order to protect
drivers and vehicles. 
The high-speed circuit (6) has three tracks
and can be used by commercial vehicles as
well as cars. This section is designed to allow
speeds of up to 200 km/h.
The handling track (9) incorporates two sec-
tions – one for speeds of up to 50 km/h, and
one for speeds up to 80 km/h. Both sections
have corners of varying severity and degrees
of camber. The handling track is mainly used
for testing handling-stability control systems.

Wheel brakes

Drum brakes

Drum brakes

Principle of operation
Drum brakes for cars generate their braking
force on the inner surface of a brake drum.
This principle is explained below based on
the example of a simplex drum brake with in-
tegral parking-brake mechanism (Figure 1).

A double-acting wheel cylinder (1) operates
the brake shoes of the drum brake. This forces
the friction lining (2) of the leading brake shoe
(12) and the trailing brake shoe (5) against
the inside of the brake drum (6). The other
ends of the brake shoes on the opposite side
to the wheel cylinder are braced by a support
bearing (15) that is attached to the brake an-
chor plate (13)

The drum brake can also be operated as a

parking brake by means of the hand-brake
lever (7) and hand-brake cable (8).

Automatic self-adjusting mechanism
The automatic self-adjusting mechanism (Fig-
ures 1 and 2) maintains a constant clearance
between the brake shoes and the brake drum
(gap between the brake shoe and drum when
the brakes are not applied). 
The adjusting mechanism consists of 
(cid:1) the pressure sleeve (18), 
(cid:1) the adjusting screw (16) and adjuster 

wheel (11), 

(cid:1) the return springs (4), 
(cid:1) the bimetal strip (10), 
(cid:1) the elbow lever (17) and 
(cid:1) the adjusting lever (20). 

The adjusting lever is attached to the pressure
sleeve in such a way that it is able to flex and
its adjusting dog (19) engages with the adjuster
wheel. This Bosch/Bendix patented automatic
adjusting mechanism achieves optimum ad-
justment increments of approximately 0.02 mm
per adjustment cycle.

Non-braking mode
The return springs (3, 14) hold the two brake
shoes (5, 12) and their attached friction linings
(2) away from the brake drum (6). This
presses the brake shoes against the adjusting
screw (16) with its adjuster wheel (11) so that
they are held against the pressure sleeve (18)
with the result that the elbow lever (17) in 
between is prevented from moving.

Braking mode (t < 80 °C)
When the brakes are applied, the pistons in
the wheel cylinder (1) force the brake shoes
(5, 12) and their attached friction linings (2)
against the inside of the brake drum (6). 
At the same time, the return springs (4) pull
the adjusting screw (16) and adjuster wheel
(11) away from the pressure sleeve (18). This
leaves a gap in which the elbow lever (17) can
move.

At temperatures inside the brake drum of 
< 80 °C, the spring-action adjusting lever (20)
pushes the lower arm of the elbow lever (17)
upwards. This allows the angled adjusting dog
(19) to engage in the teeth of the adjuster
wheel (11). If, as a result of brake wear, the
clearance between the brake drum and brake
linings is larger than the design requirement,
the adjusting lever turns the adjuster wheel by
the width of one tooth, thereby unscrewing the
adjusting screw (16) a small amount and in-
creasing the overall length of the adjusting
mechanism. This restores the clearance to the
correct amount.

Braking mode (t > 80 °C)
Temperatures of > 80 °C generated by extended
or frequent braking (for example on long de-
scents) cause the brake drum to expand. The
clearance between the brake shoes and the
drum then becomes larger (expansion clear-
ance) than the design requirement. In such
cases, the bimetal strip (10) prevents auto-
matic adjustment. The bimetal strip bends up-
wards and holds the elbow lever (17) in posi-
tion. Consequently, the adjusting lever (20)
cannot move and no adjustment can take place.

Hand-brake lever
The hand-brake mechanism operates the drum
brake by means of a cable (8) that is attached
to the lower end of the hand-brake lever (7).
The hand-brake lever is pivoted at the top in
the trailing brake shoe (5) and engages in the
adjusting screw (16) of the self-adjusting mech-
anism. When the hand brake is operated, the
cable pulls the hand-brake lever to the right
at the bottom. Its rounded upper right edge
levers against the self-adjusting mechanism
and first of all pushes the trailing shoe (5)
outwards until it contacts the drum (6). It
then pushes the leading shoe (12) against the
brake drum by levering through the adjusting
screw of the self-adjusting mechanism.

Wheel brakes

Drum brakes

Types of drum brake
Two different types of drum brake are distin-
guished according to the way in which the
brake shoes are mounted and pivot:
(cid:1) Drum brakes with fixed-pivot brake shoes

(Figures 3a and 3b)

(cid:1) Drum brakes with sliding shoes with parallel
or sloping anchors (Figures 3c and 3d)

Fixed-pivot brake shoes can wear unevenly as
they are not self-centring like sliding shoes.

In addition they also have a tendency for 
the trailing shoe to be self-inhibiting (i.e. it
diminishes the braking force applied, the 
opposite of self-augmenting). Sliding-shoe
guides are used on simplex, duplex, double-
duplex, servo and double-servo brakes. 
Most drum brakes fitted to modern cars are
of the sliding-shoe type which do not have
self-inhibiting properties.

Simplex brake
A double-acting wheel cylinder (Figure 4,
Item 5) operates the brake shoes (6, 7). The
anchor points (8) of the brake shoes are also
pivot points (2 single pivots or1 double pivot).
When the vehicle is travelling forwards, the
leading shoe (6) has a self-augmenting effect
(2) while the trailing shoe (7) is self-inhibiting
(3); when the vehicle is moving backwards,
those effects are reversed.
Self-augmenting factor: approx. 2 to 4.

Duplex brake
Each brake shoe is operated by a single-acting
wheel cylinder (Figure 5, Item 4). The sliding-
type brake shoes (6) are anchored against the
back of the opposing wheel cylinder in each case.
The duplex brake is a single-acting brake, i.e.
when the vehicle is moving forwards, it has two
leading, self-augmenting (2) brake shoes.
When reversing there is no self-augmenting
effect. Self-augmenting factor: up to approx. 6.

Duo-duplex brake
Two double-acting wheel cylinders (Figure 6,
Item 4) operate the sliding-type brake shoes (6)
that are anchored against the opposing wheel
cylinder in each case. The duo-duplex brake is a
double-acting brake, i.e. it has two leading,self-
augmenting(2)brakeshoeswhentravelling for-
wards or in reverse. Self-augmenting factor: up
to approx. 6.

Servo brake
A double-acting wheel cylinder (Figure 7,
Item 4) operates the two sliding-type brake
shoes (5, 6). Unlike simplex and duplex
brakes, the brake shoes are not anchored
against a fixed point but have floating ends
that bear against a pressure pin (7) that can
move in one direction only. When the vehicle
is travelling forwards, this transmits the 
bracing force of the primary shoe (5) to the
secondary shoe (6), imparting to it an even
greater self-augmenting effect than achieved
by the primary shoe. When the vehicle is re-
versing, the servo brake acts in the same way
as a simplex brake. Self-augmenting factor: 
up to approx. 6.

Drum brakes

Duo-servo brake
A double-acting wheel cylinder (Figure 8,
Item 4) operates the two brake shoes (5, 6). In
contrast with the servo brake, the sliding-type
brake shoes are anchored against a pressure
pin (7) which can move in both  directions.
When the vehicle is travelling forwards or
backwards, this transmits the bracing force of
the primary shoe (6) to the secondary shoe
(5), imparting to it an even greater self-aug-
menting effect than achieved by the primary
shoe. 
Self-augmenting factor: up to approx. 6.

Self-augmenting effect
The extent of the self-augmenting effect is an
important property of drum brakes. Self-aug-
mentation is an effect whereby the effective
braking force is greater than the force that
would result directly from the application
force generated by the master cylinder. It is
brought about by the fact that the friction be-
tween the leading brake shoe and the drum
creates a turning force around the brake-shoe
pivot which forces the shoe against the drum,
thereby supplementing the application force 
of the braking system. Only on the simplex
brake does the trailing brake shoe also create
a turning force around the shoe pivot that di-
minishes the force applied by the hydraulic
system, in other words a self-inhibiting or self-
diminishing effect.

Adjusting mechanisms
As brake friction linings are subject to wear,
and wear enlarges the clearance between the
brake linings and the drum, drum brakes are
fitted with adjusting mechanisms for adjust-
ing the shoes. There are several types of ad-
justing mechanism:
(cid:1) manually operated adjusting mechanisms

on the wheel cylinder

(cid:1) manually operated adjusting mechanisms

on the anchor bearings

(cid:1) automatic adjusting mechanisms 

(see above, Figures 1 and 2)

Wheel cylinder
On drum brakes, the brake pressure generated
in the master cylinder is transmitted by the
wheel cylinder via its cup seal (Figure 11,
Item 4), piston (5) and the pressure pins (1, 7)
to the brake shoes and forces them against the
brake drum. The piston spring (2) ensures that
the pressure pins are always held against the
brake shoe. A rubber dust cap (6) protects the
cylinder against dirt and damp.

There are single-acting and double-acting
wheel cylinders, as well as designs with an in-
tegral pressure regulating valve (patented by
Bosch/Bendix).

Figure 9 shows the method of operation of
the adjusting mechanism on a double- acting
wheel cylinder (4) for simplex, duplex and
servo brakes. The combined cylinder cap and
adjuster wheel (3) is tapped in the centre for
the threaded adjuster pin (2) which has a
slotted head into which the brake shoe (1) lo-
cates. By passing a screwdriver through a hole
in the brake backplate, the adjuster wheel (3)
can be turned to adjust the brake-shoe clear-
ance.

Figure 10 shows the method of operation
of an adjusting mechanism integrated in the
anchor bearing of a servo brake. In order to
adjust the brake-shoe clearance, two adjusting
screws (5) with slotted heads into which the
brake shoes (1) locate, are screwed in or out
by turning the adjuster wheels (2, 4). These
are integral with the adjusting nuts (6).

The desire on the part of vehicle manufac-
turers for an automatic self-adjusting mecha-
nism has produced the following designs:
(cid:1) friction adjustment on the brake shoe
(cid:1)  adjustment incorporated in the wheel

cylinder

(cid:1) incremental adjustment

The incremental system is the only one which
is of any significance and has been described
previously in the section dealing with the basic
principle of a drum brake (Figures 1 and 2).

Wheel brakes

Disk brakes

Disk brakes

Principle of operation
Disk brakes generate the braking forces on the
surface of a brake disk that rotates with the
wheel. The U-shaped brake caliper is attached
to non-rotating suspension components.

Designs (Summary)
There are three types of disk brake that can
be distinguished. Their basic principles are
briefly explained below and described in more
detail on the following pages.

Fixed-caliper brake
Two pistons in a rigidly mounted caliper press
the brake pads against the disk from both sides
(Figure 1a).

Floating-caliper brake
A rigidly mounted caliper bracket holds a
movable (“floating”) caliper (Figure 1b). 
The single piston forces the inner brake pad
against the brake disk while the cylinder body
is simultaneously forced in the opposite di-
rection, thereby moving the sliding caliper,
and indirectly pressing the outer brake pad
against the disk.

Sliding-caliper brake
The sliding-caliper brake is a variation of the
floating-caliper brake (Figure 1c). The single
piston inside the sliding caliper presses the 
inner brake pad directly against the brake disk.
The resulting reaction force simultaneously
shifts the caliper body in the opposite direc-
tion, thereby indirectly pressing the outer pad
against the disk.

Components of a disk brake
Piston seal
A rubber seal with a rectangular cross section
sits in a groove aroundtheinsideof thecylinder
and forms a seal around the piston while also
automatically adjusting the clearance between
brake pad and disk (Figure 2). The internal di-
ameter of the seal is slightly smaller than the
piston diameter, so that the sealisundertension
and grips the piston. When the brakes are ap-
plied, the piston moves towards the brake disk
and in so doing stretches the seal, which is de-
signed so that its static friction prevents it from
sliding over the piston until (as a result of pad
wear) the distance travelled by the piston in
order to close the gap between itself and the
disk is greater than the design clearance.
 Because the seal is elastic, it stores energy that
returns it to its original shape and position so
that it pulls the piston back when the brake is

released, i.e. when the hydraulic pressure is re-
moved. This is only possible when the pressure
in the brake pipes feeding the disk brake has
completely dissipated. The pad clearance on a
disk brake is around 0.15 mm and is therefore in
thevicinityof themaximumpermissible static
disk runout.

As the brake pad wears and the piston travel
increases, the seal slides over it, thus allowing
it to protrude further and thereby effecting
automatic infinitely variable adjustment of
the brake-pad clearance. Consequently, the
pad clearance is kept constant and the disk
can rotate freely when the pad is not under
pressure.

Expander spring
The expander spring used on fixed-caliper
brakes is in the shape of a cross and has the
job of pressing the brake pads against the 
pistons and assisting release of the brakes
(Figure 3).

Brake piston (positioning)
If the pistons of fixed-caliper and floating-
caliper disk brakes have heels (Figure 4, 
Item 4) with a depth of approx. 3 mm on the
pad leading-edge side, those heels must be set
an angle of 20° to the horizontal using a pis-
ton gauge (3). The piston heel acting on the
brake pad  reduces the pressure of the brake
pad against the disk on the pad leading edge
and therefore helps to produce more even
pad wear. A similar effect is produced by pis-
ton offset, whereby the piston does not act
centrally on the brake pad but is offset between
2 and 6 mm towards the trailing edge of the
pad. The more evenly distributed pad pres-
sure that this produces leads to more even pad
wear. As an additional bonus, this feature also
has a noise-reducing effect.

Wheel brakes

Disk brakes

Fixed-caliper brake
Function
The hydraulic pressure from the master cylin-
der is transmitted to the fixed-caliper brake,
in which it produces the application force for
the brake pads. The fixed caliper holds the
brake pads, braces the brake forces and auto-
matically adjusts the brake-pad clearance.

Design
The caliper is made of two halves (Figure 5,
Items 1 and 9) that are held together by the
caliper tie bolt (2). In each half of the caliper
there may be one or two pistons (8) for pressing
the brake shoes (5) against the brake disk (6).
The brake fluid enters the caliper and passes
into the piston chambers via the inlet port
(10) and the connecting channel (4). Each
piston is sealed against the caliper by a ring
seal (3) and protected against the ingress of
dirt, damp and friction-pad dust by a dust seal
(7). The fixed-caliper brake is attached to the
hub carrier through its mounting flange (11).

Method of operation
When the brakes are applied, hydraulic pres-
sure from the master cylinder acts via the inlet
port (10) on both pistons (8), thereby pro-
ducing the actuating force by which the brake
pads (5) are pressed against the friction sur-
faces of the brake disk (6). The size of that
controllable actuating force is determined by
the foot pressure applied to the brake pedal.
When the brake is released, i.e. when the foot
is taken off the brake pedal, the master-cylinder
piston is returned to its original position by
the force of its compression spring and the
pressure transmitted to the brake caliper
through the brake pipe is released. The pistons
(8) are then drawn back to their original po-
sitions by the elastic piston seals (3). Having
been released by the brake pads, the brake disk
(6) is then free to rotate again.If the piston travel
is greater than the design clearance between
brake pad and disk due to pad wear, the piston
slides through the seal when the brakes are
applied and the clearance is reset to its correct
amount.

Disk brakes

67

Method of operation
When the brakes are applied, hydraulic pres-
sure from the master cylinder acts via the inlet
port (6) on the piston (7) which moves out of
the cylinder, closing the clearance gap and
pressing the inner brake pad (5) against the
brake disk (1). The hydraulic pressure simul-
taneously acts against the cylinder body (8),
moving the floating caliper (2) in the opposite
direction to the piston, and indirectly pressing
the outer brake pad (4) against the disk after
closing the clearance gap on that side. When
the brake pedal is released,the hydraulic pressure
at the inlet port (6) is removed.As on the fixed-
caliper brake, the elastic piston seal (9) draws
the piston (7) back by an amount equivalent
to the clearance gap and the disk is then free
to rotate again.

Notes
Like the fixed-caliper brake, the floating-caliper
design does not require adjustment or re  ad just -
ment. Becauseitis more compact, this brake is
particularly suited to use on vehicles where
space is restricted or which have a negative
kingpin offset. Because air can circulate freely
around the hydraulic components, the hydraulic
fluidiseffectivelycooled.Floating-caliper brakes
can incorporate a parking-brake mechanism.

6

Floating-caliper brake

Notes
Adjustment or readjustment of the fixed-
caliper brake is unnecessary due to the self-
adjusting effect of the elastic piston seals. 
Because of their high mechanical strength,
fixed-caliper brakes are used on heavy and
high-speed cars. Their disadvantage is their
sensitivity to heat under extended periods of
braking (e.g. on long descents). That sensitiv-
ity is re duced on high-performance brakes by
replacing the internal hydraulic channel between
the two halves of the caliper with an external
brake pipe. Fixed-caliper brakes require more
space inside the wheel rim so that on vehicles
with a negative kingpin offset floating-caliper
or sliding caliper brakes are generally preferred.

Floating-caliper brake
Function
The floating-caliper brake generates the
 actuating force for the brake pads from the
hydraulic pressure created in the master
cylinder, holds the brake pads, braces the
brake forces and automatically adjusts the
brake-pad clearance.

Design
The floating-caliper brake consists of two
main components (Figure 6):
(cid:1) the caliper bracket (3), which holds the

cylinder (8) and piston (7) assembly and
the brake pads (4, 5), and is rigidly attached
to the hub carrier, and

(cid:1) the floating caliper (2) which slides in the
curved guideways of the caliper bracket.

A guide spring helps the caliper bracket and
floating caliper to slide smoothly and quietly
over each other. The brake fluid enters the
chamber between the cylinder body and the
piston via the inlet port (6).

Sliding-caliper brake
Function
The sliding-caliper brake (Figure 7) produces
the application force for the brake pads by 
using the hydraulic pressure from the master
cylinder. The sliding caliper holds the brake
pads, braces the brake forces and automati-
cally adjusts the brake-pad clearance.

Comparison with floating-caliper brake
The sliding-caliper brake is easier to service
than the floating-caliper brake from which it
was developed. Like the floating-caliper brake,
it too has a movable caliper (3, 10) and a 
single piston (9). Similar too is the way in
which the hydraulic pressure moves the pis-
ton against the inner pad while simultaneously
pushing the caliper body (3) in the opposite
direction so as to indirectly press the outer
pad (4) against the disk (5). The caliper, how-
ever, slides on two guide pins (2) instead of
on a caliper bracket. 

7

Sliding-caliper brake

Design
The sliding caliper (3, 10) is mounted on two
guide pins (2) on which it is able to slide in
and out. A bracket (1) attached to the hub
carrier holds the two guide pins. The piston
(9) acts directly on the inner brake pad (6) and
indirectly on the outer brake pad (4). 
The inlet port (8) connects the caliper to the
master cylinder.

Method of operation
When the brakes are applied, hydraulic pres-
sure from the master cylinder acts via the inlet
port (8) on the piston (9) which moves out of
the caliper and directly presses the inner brake
pad (6) against the brake disk (5). As the
brake fluid pressure acts with equal force
against the piston and the caliper (10), the
sliding caliper is pushed in the opposite direc-
tion to the piston. The caliper then slides on
the guide pins (2) and draws the outer brake
pad (4) against the disk. Both brake pads are
then pressed against the disk with equal force.
When the brake is released,
the elastic piston seal (7)
pulls the piston back to its
original position.

then free to rotate again. When the parking
brake is applied, a cable pulls the hand-brake
lever (17) so that the cam (15) turns and
presses the tappet (16) and the push-rod (12)
against the piston, which then directly presses
the inner brake pad against the disk. The
outer brake pad is pressed against the other
side of the disk by the reactive force.

In addition to the parking-brake mechanism

illustrated in Figure 8, there is also the BIR
(Ball in Ramp) mechanism. In that case, the
inner brake pad is not moved by means of a
tappet, but by balls instead. When the parking
brake is applied, the parking-brake mechanism
is caused to rotate, thereby moving three balls,
each of which runs in a ramp-shaped groove.
Those ramps convert the rotation into a linear
movement by means of which the piston
presses the brake pads against the disk.

Sliding-caliper brake with integral parking-
brake mechanism
Function
This sliding-caliper brake functions both as a
service brake and a parking brake. It produces
the application force for the brake pads from
the hydraulic pressure from the master cylin-
der or the tension applied by the handbrake
lever. The sliding caliper holds the brake pads,
braces the brake forces and automatically ad-
justs the brake-pad clearance.

Design
The sliding-caliper body (Figure 8, Item 8) is
mounted on two guide pins (2) on which it is
able to slide in and out. A bracket attached to
the hub carrier holds the two guide pins. The
piston (6) presses the inner brake pad (5) and
the outer brake pad (3) against the disk (4)
directly and indirectly respectively. The piston
is hydraulically operated by the brake fluid
entering the inlet port (11). 
A metal casing (10) and a sealing disk (13)
isolate the hydraulic system from the parking-
brake mechanism which is operated by the
hand-brake lever (17).

54

Method of operation
When the service brakes are applied, hydraulic
pressure from the master cylinder acts via the
inlet port (11) on the piston (6) which moves
out of the caliper and directly presses the inner
brake pad (5) against the
brake disk (4).At the same
time, the hydraulic pres-
sure acts with equal force
against the sliding caliper-
 body base. The caliper
body (8) then slides on
the guide pins (2) and
draws the outer brake pad
(3) against the disk. The
brake-pad pressure is thus
equal on both sides of the
disk.When the brake is re-
leased, the elastic piston
seal (18) draws the pis-
ton back to its original
position and the disk is

Wheel brakes

Brake pads, shoes and disks

Brake pads, shoes and disks

Braking sequence
During braking, the brake pads or shoes are
pressed against a surface which is rotating
with the wheel. This friction pairing generates
a frictional or braking force that converts the
kinetic energy of the vehicle into heat. On disk
brakes, the braking force is generated by the
friction pairing of brake-pad friction material
and disk, and on drum brakes by the friction
pairing of brake-shoe friction lining and drum.
The kinetic friction coefficient between brake-
pad/shoe friction material/lining and disk/
drum determines, among other things, the
amount of force that has to be applied to the
brake pedal to achieve a given braking effect.
It also has a fundamental effect on brake bal-
ance and vehicle handling stability under
braking. 

Brake-shoe friction linings are riveted or
glued to the brake shoe. The brake shoes have
a T-shaped cross-section which gives them
the required rigidity. To make them easier 
to fit, brake shoes can be supplied as a pre-
 assembled drum-brake kit comprising shoes,
wheel cylinder and accessories.

material and an intermediate layer that are
glued to the metal backing plate.

Brake-type usage
Nowadays, all cars are fitted with disk brakes
on the front wheels. Drum brakes are fitted to
the rear wheels of smaller/medium-sized cars.

Composition of brake friction material
The friction material from which brake linings/
pads are made is basically made up of four raw
materials. The relative proportions of those
materials depends on the specifics of the ap-
plication and the required frictional coefficient
(static and kinetic). Thus, the friction material
used on the disk-brake pads for a large execu-
tive saloon is different from that used in the
brake-shoe linings for a small “runabout”. The
precise details of the friction material compo-
sitions are well-guarded secrets known only to
the manufacturers (Table1lists examples of the
main constituents).

Replacement intervals for brake
shoes/pads
As a rule drum-brake shoes have to be re-
placed twice as frequently as the drums, while
disk-brake pads normally need to be renewed
five times as often as the disks. 
For the spare-parts trade, this obviously
means that brake pads for disk brakes are sold
in much larger numbers than brake shoes for
drum brakes.

On some vehicles, a wear sensor integrated
in the brake pad comes into contact with the
disk when the friction material has been worn
down to a thickness of 3.5 mm. In so doing, it
completes an electrical circuit connected to an
indicator lamp on the dashboard, thus warn-
ing the driver that the pads need replacing.

Note
If the brake pads/shoes or the disk/drum on
one wheel require replacement, the pads/
shoes or disk/drum on the opposite wheel
should always be replaced at the same time in
order to ensure that even braking efficiency is
maintained on both (front or rear) wheels.
When replacing brake shoes, pads, drums or
disks, it is important to use only those com-
ponents approved by the brake manufacturer.

Brake pads, shoes and disks

Approval of disk-brake pads
A requirements profile detailing vehicle speci-
fications, operating conditions and specific
customer requirements forms the basis for 
selection of a suitable base material. A bench
test checks the brake friction material for per-
formance, noise/vibration characteristics and
wear. Once that test has been passed, the road
test follows.

The road test encompasses a performance
test, an endurance test to check for wear, an
extreme-load test including a drive over a
mountain pass, and a test for perceptible vi-
brations and noise. If all the tests are success-
fully completed, the friction material is ap-
proved. If only the noise characteristics are
unsatisfactory, secondary modifications are
made to the friction pad such as application
of a rubber coating or attachment of damper
plates. On completion of those modifications,
the brake pads are put through the bench test
and road test again.

Approved disk-brake pads are identified by

a number on the pad surface (Figure 3).

Braking noises produced by disk-brake
pads
Uneven frictional processes between the brake
pad and the disk generate vibrations, whose
sound waves can be discernible inside the 
vehicle to the driver, depending on their fre-
quency. The major determinants of brake
noise are brake pressure, brake-disk tempera-
ture, vehicle speed and climatic conditions.

3

Disk-brake pad numbering

Brake noises that occur during the braking 
sequence are distinguished according to whether
they are produced at the point when the brakes
are applied, continuously while the brakes are
on, or when they are released. Low-frequency
noises between 0 and 500 Hz are imperceptible
from inside the car. Noises with a frequency
of 500 ... 1,500 Hz are not distinguishable by
the driver as brake noises. High-frequency
noises of between 1,500 and 15,000 Hz are
recognisable by the driver as brake noises.

Table 2 contains a trouble-shooting chart 

for noisy brakes detailing fault causes and
remedies.

73

Brake disks
Like brake drums, brake disks are attached to
the wheel hubs and for most applications are
made of cast iron or steel. Compared with 
the shoes in drum brakes, the pressure with
which the pads are applied to a disk is greater
as their surface area is smaller. This results in
the generation of more heat and a faster rate
of pad wear as compared with drum-brake
shoes. A brake disk is exposed to the air and
therefore effectively cooled by the air flow
when the vehicle is in motion.

Disks can be of three types: unventilated,
ventilated from the inside, or ventilated from
the outside (Figure 4). Due to their greater
mass, ventilated disks have a greater heat-
storage capacity and also cool down more
quickly as a result of their radial ventilation
channels that have a fan effect. Consequently,
ventilated disks are usually preferred for the
front wheels.

Outlook
For a number of years, research has been con-
ducted into the use of carbon fibre as a mate-
rial for brake disks in order to reduce vehicle
weight, particularly on racing cars. Ventilated
disks made entirely of carbon  fibre have been
tested under race conditions.

The latest developments have made it pos-
sible to produce composite brake disks made
of ceramic materials. In combination with new
friction-pad materials, these new disks are 
expected to last as long as the vehicle itself.
Since ceramic disks are only half the weight 
of conventional cast-iron disks, the overall
weight of the vehicle can be reduced and
greater fuel economy achieved. At the same
time, the response characteristics of the shock
absorbers are improved due to the lower un-
sprung mass.

Antilock braking system

System overview

Antilock braking system (ABS)

In hazardous driving conditions, it is possible
for the wheels of a vehicle to lock up under
braking. The possible causes include wet or
slippery road surfaces, and abrupt reaction
on the part of the driver (unexpected hazard).
The vehicle can become uncontrollable as a
result, and may go into a slip and/or leave the
road. The antilock braking system (ABS) de-
tects if one or more wheels are about to lock
up under braking and if so makes sure that
the brake pressure remains constant or is 
reduced. By so doing, it prevents the wheels
from locking up and the  vehicle remains
steerable. As a consequence the vehicle can 
be braked or stopped quickly and safely.  

System overview

The ABS braking system is based on the com-
ponents of the conventional system. Those
are 
(cid:0) the brake pedal (Fig. 1, 1),
(cid:0) the brake booster (2), 
(cid:0) the master cylinder (3),
(cid:0) the reservoir (4),
(cid:0) the brake lines (5) and hoses (6), and
(cid:0) the brakes and wheel-brake cylinders (7).

In addition there are also the following
 components: 
(cid:0) the wheel-speed sensors (8),
(cid:0) the hydraulic modulator (9), and
(cid:0) the ABS control unit (10).

The warning lamp (11) lights up if the ABS is
switched off.

Wheel-speed sensors
The speed of rotation of the wheels is an im-
portant input variable for the ABS control
system. Wheel-speed sensors detect the speed
of rotation of the wheels and pass the electri-
cal signals to the control unit. 

A car may have three or four wheel-speed
sensors depending on which version of the
ABS system is fitted (ABS system versions).
The speed signals are used to calculate the de-
gree of slip between the wheels and the road
surface and therefore detect whether any of
the wheels is about to lock up.

Electronic control unit (ECU)
The ECU processes the information received
from the sensors according to defined mathe-
matical procedures (control algorithms). The
results of those calculations form the basis for
the control signals sent to the  hydraulic mod-
ulator. 

Hydraulic modulator
The hydraulic modulator incorporates a se-
ries of solenoid valves that can open or close
the hydraulic circuits between the master
cylinder (Fig. 2, 1) and the brakes (4). In
 addition, it can connect the brakes to the
 return pump (6). Solenoid valves with two
hydraulic connections and two valve posi-
tions are used (2/2 solenoid valves). The  inlet
valve (7) between the master cylinder and 
the brake controls pressure application, while
the outlet valve (8) between the brake and the
return pump controls pressure release. There
is one such pair of solenoid valves for each
brake.

Under normal conditions, the solenoid valves
in the hydraulic modulator are at the “pres-
sure application” setting. That means the inlet
valve is open. The hydraulic modulator then
forms a straight-through connection between
the master cylinder and the brakes. Conse-
quently, the brake pressure generated in the
master cylinder when the brakes are applied 
is transmitted directly to the brakes at each
wheel. 

As the degree of brake slip increases due 
to braking on a slippery surface or heavy
braking, the risk of the wheels locking up 
also  increases. The solenoid valves are then
switched to the “maintain pressure” setting.
The connection between the master cylinder
and the brakes is shut off (inlet valve is
closed) so that any increase of pressure in the
master cylinder does not lead to a pressure
increase at the brakes.

If the degree of slip of any of the wheels in-

creases further despite this action, the pres-
sure in the brake(s) concerned must be re-
duced. To achieve this, the solenoid valves are
switched to the “pressure release” setting. The
inlet valve is still closed, and in addition, the
outlet valve opens to allow the return pump
integrated in the hydraulic modulator to
draw brake fluid from the brake(s) concerned
in a controlled manner. The pressure in the
relevant brake(s) is thus reduced so that
wheel lock-up does not occur.

Requirements placed on ABS

speed at which a vehicle can successfully
negotiate a bend of a given  radius with the
drive disengaged).

(cid:0) The system should also be able to ensure
that handling stability and steerability are
maintained and the best possible braking
effect obtained on a bumpy or uneven road
surface, regardless of the force with which
the driver applies the brakes.

(cid:0) Finally, the braking control system should
be able to detect aquaplaning (when the
wheels “float” on a film of water) and re-
spond appropriately to it. In so doing it
must be able to maintain vehicle controlla-
bility and course.

Effective range
(cid:0) The braking control system must be

 effective across the entire speed range of
the vehicle right down to crawling speed
(minimum speed limit approximately
2.5 km/h). If the wheels lock up below 
the minimum limit, the distance traveled
 before the vehicle comes to a halt is not
critical. 

Timing characteristics
(cid:0) Adjustments to take account of braking-
system hysteresis (delayed reaction to
 release of brakes) and the effects of the 
engine (when braking with the drive en-
gaged) must take as little time as possible. 
(cid:0) Pitching of the vehicle in response to sus-
pension vibration must be prevented. 

Reliability
(cid:0) There must be a monitoring circuit which
continuously checks that the ABS is func-
tioning correctly. If it detects a fault which
could impair braking characteristics, the
ABS should be switched off. A warning
lamp must then indicate to the driver that
the ABS is not functioning and only the 
basic braking system is available.

Requirements placed on ABS 

An ABS system must meet a comprehensive
range of requirements, in particular all the
safety requirements associated with dynamic
braking response and the braking-system
technology.

Handling stability and steerability
(cid:0) The braking control system should be

 capable of ensuring that the car retains 
its handling stability and steerability on 
all types of road surface (from dry roads
with good adhesion to black ice).

(cid:0) An ABS system should utilize the available
adhesion between the tires and the road
surface under braking to the maximum
possible degree, giving handling stability
and steerability precedence over minimiz-
ing braking distance. It should not make
any difference to the system whether the
driver applies the brakes violently or grad-
ually increases the braking force to the
point at which the wheels would lock.
(cid:0) The control system should be capable 

of adapting rapidly to changes in road-sur-
face grip, e.g. on a dry road with occasional
patches of ice, wheel lock-up on the ice
must be restricted to such short time spans
that handling stability and steerability are
not impaired. At the same time, it should
allow maximum utilization of adhesion
where the road is dry.

(cid:0) When braking under conditions where the
amount of available grip differs between
wheels (e.g. wheels on one side on ice, on
dry tarmac on the other – referred to as “
µ-split” conditions), the unavoidable yaw
forces (turning forces around the vehicle’s
vertical axis which attempt to turn the
 vehicle sideways) should only be allowed to
develop at a rate slow enough for the “aver-
age driver” to easily counteract them by
steering in the opposite direction.

(cid:0) When cornering, the vehicle should retain
its handling stability and steerability  under
braking and be capable of being braked to
a standstill as quickly as possible provided
its speed is sufficiently below the corner’s
limit speed (that is the absolute maximum

Figs. 1 and 2 show the physical interdepen-
dencies during a braking sequence with ABS.
The areas in which the ABS is active are
shaded blue.

Curves 1, 2 and 4 in Fig. 1 relate to road
conditions in which the level of adhesion and
therefore the braking force increases up to a
maximum limit as the brake pressure rises.
Increasing the brake pressure above that
maximum adhesion limit on a car without
ABS would constitute overbraking. When that
happens, the “sliding” proportion of the tire
footprint (the area of the tire in contact with
the road) increases so much as the tire de-
forms that the static friction diminishes and
the kinetic friction increases. 

The brake slip λ is a measure of the
 proportion of kinetic friction, whereby 
λ = 100% is the level at which the wheel locks
and only kinetic friction is present. 

λ =

(υF – υR)
υF

· 100%

indicates the degree to which the wheel’s
 circumferential speed, υR, lags behind the 
vehicle’s linear speed (road speed), υF.

From the progression shown in Fig. 1 of
curves 1 (dry conditions), 2 (wet conditions)
and 4 (black ice), it is evident that shorter
braking distances are achieved with ABS than
if the wheels are overbraked and lock up
(brake slip λ = 100%). Curve 3 (snow) shows
a different pattern whereby a wedge of snow
forms in front of the wheels when they lock
up and helps to slow the vehicle down; in 
this scenario, the advantage of ABS is in its
ability to maintain handling stability and
steerability.

As the two curves for coefficient of friction,
µHF, and lateral-force coefficient, µS, in Fig. 2
illustrate, the active range of the ABS has to
be extended for the large lateral slip angle of
α = 10° (i.e. high lateral force due to rapid

lateral acceleration of the vehicle) as com-
pared with the smaller lateral slip angle of 
α = 2°, that is to say, if the vehicle is braked
hard in a corner when the lateral acceleration
is high, the ABS cuts in sooner and  allows 
an initial level of brake slip of, say, 10%. At 
α = 10°, an initial coefficient of  friction of
only µHF = 0.35 is obtained, while the lateral-
force coefficient is almost at its maximum at
µS = 0.80. 

As the vehicle’s speed and therefore its
 lateral acceleration are reduced by braking
through the corner, the ABS is able to allow
increasingly higher levels of brake slip so that
the deceleration increases, while the  lateral-
force coefficient diminishes as the lateral 
acceleration reduces. 

Braking while cornering causes the braking
forces to rise so quickly that the overall brak-
ing distance is only marginally longer than
when braking in a straight line under identi-
cal conditions.

Controlled system
The data-processing operations performed by
the ABS control unit are based on the
 following simplified controlled system: 
(cid:0) a non-driven wheel, 
(cid:0) a quarter of the vehicle’s mass apportioned

to that wheel, 

(cid:0) the brake on that wheel and, representing

the friction pairing of tire and road surface,

(cid:0) a theoretical curve for coefficient of fric-

tion versus brake slip (Fig. 2). 

That curve is divided into a stable zone with 
a linear gradient and an unstable zone with 
a constant progression (µHFmax). As an addi-
tional simplification, there is also an assumed
initial straight-line braking response that is
equivalent to a panic braking reaction.

Fig. 3 shows the relationships between
 braking torque, MB (the torque that can be
generated by the brake through the tire), or
road-surface frictional torque, MR (torque
that acts against the wheel through the fric-
tion pairing of tire and road surface), and
time, t, as well as the relationships between
the wheel deceleration (a) and time, t,
whereby the braking torque increases in lin-
ear fashion over time. The road-surface fric-
tional torque lags slightly behind the braking
torque by the time delay, T, as long as the
braking sequence is within the stable zone of
the curve for friction coefficient versus brake
slip. After about 130 ms, the maximum level
(µHFmax) – and therefore the unstable zone –
of the curve for friction coefficient versus
brake slip is reached. From that point on, 
the curve for friction coefficient versus brake
slip states that while the braking torque, MB,
continues to rise at an undiminished rate, the
road-surface frictional torque, MR, cannot in-
crease any further and remains constant. In
the period between 130 and 240 ms (this is
when the wheel locks up), the minimal
torque difference, MB – MR, that was present
in the stable zone rises rapidly to a high fig-
ure. That torque difference is a precise mea-
sure of the wheel deceleration (–a) of the
braked wheel (Fig. 3, bottom). In the stable

small rate, whereas in the unstable zone it in-
creases rapidly. As a consequence, the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip re-
veals opposite characteristics in the stable

opposing characteristics.

Antilock braking system

ABS control loop

Controlled variables for non-driven wheels
The wheel acceleration and deceleration are
generally suitable as controlled variables for
driven and non-driven wheels provided the
driver brakes with the clutch disengaged. The
reason can be found in the opposing charac-
teristics of the controlled system in the stable
and unstable zones of the curve for friction
coefficient versus brake slip. 

In the stable zone, the wheel deceleration is
limited to relatively low rates so that when the
driver presses harder on the brake pedal, the
car brakes harder without the wheels locking
up. 

In the unstable zone, on the other hand, 
the driver only needs to apply slightly more
pressure to the brake pedal to induce instanta-
neous wheel lock-up. This characteristic
means that very often the wheel deceleration
and acceleration can be used to determine the
degree of brake slip for optimum braking. 
A fixed wheel deceleration threshold 
for initiation of the ABS control sequence
should only be fractionally above the maxi-
mum possible vehicle linear deceleration.
This is particularly important if the driver
initially only applies the brakes lightly but
then increasingly applies more pressure to 
the pedal. If the threshold is set too high, 
the wheels could then progress too far along
the curve for friction coefficient versus slip
into the unstable zone before the ABS detects
the imminent loss of control.

When the fixed threshold is initially
reached under heavy braking, the brake 
pressure at the wheel(s) concerned should
not automatically be reduced, because with
modern tires, valuable braking distance
would be lost on a surface with good grip, 
especially in cases where the initial speed is
high. 

Controlled variables
An essential factor in determining the effec-
tiveness of an ABS control system is the
choice of controlled variables. The basis 
for that choice are the wheel-speed sensor sig-
nals from which the ECU calculates the decel-
eration/acceleration of the wheel, brake slip,
the reference speed and the vehicle decelera-
tion. On their own, neither the wheel deceler-
ation/acceleration nor the brake slip are suit-
able as controlled variables because, under
braking, a driven wheel behaves  entirely dif-
ferently to a non-driven wheel. However, by
combining those variables on the basis of ap-
propriate logical relationships, good results
can be obtained.

As brake slip is not directly measurable, the
ECU calculates a quantity that approximates
to it. The basis for the calculation is the refer-
ence speed, which represents the speed under
ideal braking conditions (optimum degree of
brake slip). So that speed can be determined,
the wheel-speed sensors continuously trans-
mit signals to the ECU for calculating the
speed of the wheels. The ECU takes the signals
from a pair of diagonally opposed wheels (e. g.
right front and left rear) and calculates the ref-
erence speed from them. Under partial brak-
ing, the faster of the two diagonally opposite
wheels generally determines the reference
speed. If the ABS cuts in under emergency
braking, the wheel speeds will be different
from the vehicle’s  linear speed and can thus
not be used for calculating the reference speed
without adjustment. During the ABS control
sequence, the ECU provides the reference
speed based on the speed at the start of the
control sequence and reduces it at a linear
rate. The gradient of the reference-speed
graph is determined by analyzing logical
 signals and relationships.

If, in addition to the wheel acceleration/ de-
celeration and the brake slip, the vehicle’s lin-
ear deceleration is brought into the equation
as an additional quantity, and if the logical
circuit in the ECU is modulated by computa-
tion results, then ideal brake control can be
achieved. That concept has been realized in
the Bosch Antilock Braking System (ABS).

Effectiveness of control
An efficient antilock braking system must
meet the criteria listed below for the standard
of control.
(cid:0) Maintenance of handling stability by

 provision of adequate lateral forces at 
the rear wheels

(cid:0) Maintenance of steerability by provision of
adequate lateral forces at the front wheels

(cid:0) Reduction of braking distances as com-

pared with locked-wheel braking by opti-
mum utilization of the available adhesion
between tires and road surface

(cid:0) Rapid adjustment of braking force to dif-
ferent friction coefficients, for instance
when driving through puddles or over
patches of ice or compacted snow.
(cid:0) Ensuring application of low braking-
torque control amplitudes to prevent
 suspension vibration

(cid:0) High degree of user-friendliness due to

minimal pedal feedback (“pedal judder”)
and low levels of noise from the actuators
(solenoid valves and return pump in the
hydraulic modulator).

The criteria listed can only be optimized
 collectively rather than individually. Never-
theless, vehicle handling stability and steer-
ability are always among the top priorities.

Initial braking phase for a non-driven wheel and 
a driving wheel connected to the drivetrain

Controlled variables for driven wheels
If first or second gear is engaged when the
brakes are applied, the engine acts on the dri-
ven wheels and substantially increases their
effective mass moment of inertia ΘR, i. e. the
wheels behave as if they were considerably
heavier. The sensitivity with which the wheel
deceleration responds to changes in the 
braking torque in the unstable zone of the
curve for friction coefficient versus brake slip
diminishes to an equal extent. 

The starkly opposing characteristics dis-
played by non-driven wheels in the stable and
unstable zone of the curve for friction coeffi-
cient versus brake slip are evened out to a
substantial degree, so that in this situation the
wheel deceleration is often insufficient as a
controlled variable for identifying the degree
of brake slip offering the greatest possible
friction. It is necessary instead to introduce as
an additional controlled variable a quantity
that approximates to brake slip and to com-
bine it in a suitable manner with the wheel
deceleration.

Fig. 4 compares an initial braking sequence
on a non-driven wheel and on a driving
wheel that is connected to the drivetrain. 
In this example, the engine’s inertia increases
the effective wheel inertia by a factor of four.
On the non-driven wheel, a specific threshold
for deceleration (–a)1 is exceeded very soon
after leaving the stable zone of the curve for
friction coefficient versus brake slip. Because
it has a moment of inertia that is four times
greater, the driven wheel requires a torque
difference four times as big

∆M2 = 4 · ∆M1

to exceed the threshold (–a)2. Consequently,
the driven wheel may by then have progressed
a long way into the unstable zone of the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip, re-
sulting in impaired vehicle  handling stability.

Control cycle on surfaces with good grip
(High coefficient of friction) 
If the ABS sequence is activated on a road
surface with good grip (high coefficient of
friction), the subsequent pressure rise must
be 5 to 10 times slower than in the initial
braking phase in order to prevent undesirable
suspension vibration. That requirement pro-
duces the control-cycle progression for high
coefficients of friction illustrated in Fig. 1. 

As a result, the relevant solenoid valve
switches to the “maintain pressure” setting. 
At this point the brake pressure must not be
reduced, because the threshold (–a) might be
exceeded within the stable zone of the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip and
then potential braking distance would be
“wasted”. At the same time, the  reference
speed, υRef, reduces according to a defined
linear gradient. The reference speed is used as
the basis for determining the slip switching
threshold, λ1. 

During the initial phase of braking, the brake
pressure at the wheel and the rate of wheel
deceleration (negative acceleration) rise. At
the end of phase 1, the wheel deceleration
passes the set threshold level (–a). 

At the end of phase 2, the wheel speed, υR,
drops below the λ1 threshold. At that point, 
the solenoid valves switch to the “reduce 
pressure” setting so that the pressure drops, 
and they remain at that setting as long as

the wheel deceleration is above the threshold
(–a). 

At the end of phase 3, the deceleration rate
falls below the threshold (–a) again and a
pressure-maintenance phase of a certain
length follows. During that period, the wheel
acceleration has increased so much that the
threshold (+a) is passed. The pressure contin-
ues to be maintained at a constant level. 

At the end of phase 4, the wheel acceleration
exceeds the relatively high threshold level
(+A). The brake pressure then increases for as
long as the acceleration remains above the
threshold (+A).

In phase 6, the brake pressure is once again
held constant because the acceleration is
above the threshold (+a). At the end of this
phase, the wheel acceleration falls below the
threshold (+a). This is an indication that the
wheel has returned to the stable zone of the
curve for friction coefficient versus brake slip
and is now slightly underbraked. 

The brake pressure is now increased in 
stages (phase 7) until the wheel deceleration
passes the threshold (–a) (end of phase 7).
This time, the brake pressure is reduced
 immediately without a λ1 signal being
 generated.

threshold, the brake pressure is reduced over
a short, fixed period. 

A further short pressure-maintenance
phase follows. Then, once again, the wheel
speed is compared to the slip switching
threshold λ1 and, as a consequence, the
 pressure reduced over a short, fixed period.
In the following pressure-maintenance
phase, the wheel starts to accelerate again
and its  acceleration exceeds the threshold
(+a). This results in another pressure-main-
tenance phase which lasts until the accelera-
tion drops below the threshold (+a) again
(end of phase 5). In phase 6, the incremental
pressure-increase pattern seen in the preced-
ing section takes place again until, in phase 7,
pressure is released and a new control cycle
starts.

Control cycle on slippery surfaces 
(low coefficient of friction) 
In contrast with good grip conditions, on 
a slippery road surface even very light pres-
sure on the brake pedal is frequently enough
to make the wheels lock up. They then re-
quire much longer to emerge from a high-
slip phase and accelerate again. The process-
ing logic of the ECU detects the prevailing
road conditions and adapts the ABS re-
sponse characteristics to suit. Fig. 3 shows 
a typical control cycle for road conditions
with low levels of adhesion.

In phases 1 to 3, the control sequence is
the same as for high-adhesion conditions. 

Phase 4 starts with a short pressure-main-

tenance phase. Then, within a very short
space of time, the wheel speed is compared
with the slip switching threshold λ1. As the
wheel speed is lower than the slip switching

In the cycle described above, the control logic
detected that following pressure release –
triggered by the signal (–a) – two more 
pressure-reduction stages were necessary 
to induce the wheel to accelerate again. 
The wheel remains in the higher-slip zone for
a relatively long period, which is not ideal for
handling stability and steerability.

In order to improve those two characteris-

tics, this next control cycle and those that 
follow incorporate continual comparison of
wheel speed with the slip switching threshold
λ1. As a consequence, the brake pressure is
continuously reduced in phase 6 until, in
phase 7, the wheel acceleration exceeds the
threshold (+a). Because of that continuous
pressure release, the wheel retains a high level
of slip for only a short period so that vehicle
handling and steerability are improved in
comparison with the first control cycle.

Control cycle with yaw-moment 
buildup delay
When the brakes are applied in situations
where the grip conditions differ significantly
between individual wheels (“µ-split” condi-
tions) – for example, if the wheels on one side
of the car are on dry tarmac while those on
the other side are on ice – vastly different
braking forces will be produced at the front
wheels (Fig. 4). That difference in braking
force creates a turning force (yaw moment)
around the vehicle’s vertical axis. It also gener-
ates steering feedback effects of varying types
dependent on the vehicle’s kingpin offset.
With a positive kingpin offset, corrective
steering is made more difficult, while a nega-
tive kingpin offset has a stabilizing effect.

Heavy cars tend to have a relatively long
wheelbase and a high level of inertia around
the vertical axis. With vehicles of this type,
the yaw effect develops slowly enough for the
driver to react and take corrective steering ac-
tion during ABS braking. Smaller cars with
short wheelbases and lower levels of  inertia,
on the other hand, require an ABS system
supplemented by a yaw-moment buildup de-
lay (GMA system) to make them equally con-
trollable under emergency braking in condi-
tions where there are wide differences in grip
between individual wheels. Development of
the yaw moment can be inhibited by delayed
pressure increase in the brake on the front
wheel that is on the part of the road offering
the higher level of adhesion (the “high”
wheel).

Fig. 5 (overleaf) illustrates the principle of the
yaw-moment buildup delay: 
Curve 1 shows the brake pressure, p, in the
master cylinder. Without yaw-moment
buildup delay, the wheel on the tarmac
quickly reaches the pressure phigh (curve 2)
and the wheel on the ice, the pressure plow
(curve 5). Each wheel is braked with the
 specific maximum possible deceleration
 (individually controlled).

GMA 1 system
On vehicles with less extreme handling charac-
teristics, the GMA 1 system is used. With this
system, during the initial phases of braking
(curve 3), as soon as the pressure is reduced 
for the first time at the “low” wheel  because
this shows a tendency to lock up, the brake
pressure at the “high” wheel is increased in
stages. Once the brake pressure at the “high”
wheel reaches its lock-up point, it is no longer
affected by the signals from the “low” wheel,
and is individually controlled so that it is able
to utilize the maximum possible braking 
force. This method gives the type of vehicle 
referred to satisfactory steering characteristics
under emergency braking on surfaces offering
unequal grip to individual wheels. As the 
maximum brake pressure at the “high” wheel 
is reached within a relatively short time 
(750 ms), the braking distance is only margin-
ally longer than for vehicles without a yaw-
moment buildup delay facility.

GMA 2 system
The GMA 2 system is used on vehicles with
more extreme handling characteristics. With
this system, as soon as the brake pressure at
the “low” wheel is reduced, the ABS solenoid
valves for the “high” wheel are directed to
maintain and then reduce the pressure for 
a specific period (Fig. 5, curve 4). Renewed
pressure increase at the “low” wheel then trig-
gers incremental increase of pressure at the
“high” wheel, though with pressure-increase
periods a certain amount longer than for the
“low” wheel. This pressure metering takes
place not only in the first control cycle but
throughout the braking sequence.

The effect of the yaw moment on steering
characteristics is all the more exaggerated the
greater the speed of the vehicle when the
brakes are first applied. The GMA 2 system
divides the vehicle speed into four ranges. 
In each of those ranges, the yaw moment 
is inhibited to differing degrees. In the high
speed ranges, the pressure-increase periods at
the “high” wheel are progressively shortened,
while the pressure-decrease periods at the
“low” wheel are progressively lengthened in
order to achieve effective inhibition of yaw-
moment generation at high vehicle speeds.
Fig. 5 below compares the steering angle pro-
gression necessary for maintaining a straight
course under braking without GMA (curve 6)
and with GMA (curve 7). 

Another important aspect with regard 
to GMA usage is the vehicle’s response to
braking in a corner. If the driver brakes when
cornering at a high speed, the GMA increases
the dynamic load on the front wheels while
reducing it at the rear. As a  result, the lateral
forces acting on the front wheels become
stronger while those acting on the rear wheels
diminish. This generates a turning moment
towards the inside of the bend as a result of
which the vehicle slews off its line towards the
inside of its intended course and is very diffi-
cult to bring back  under control (Fig. 6a). 

Antilock braking system

Typical control cycles

87

The ideal method of inhibiting yaw-moment
buildup involves a compromise between good
steering characteristics and suitably short
braking distance and is developed by Bosch
individually for a specific vehicle model
through consultation with the manufacturer. 

In order to avoid this critical response to
braking, the GMA also takes the lateral accel-
eration into account. The GMA is deactivated
at high lateral acceleration rates. As a result, a
high braking force is generated at the outside
front wheel during the initial phase of brak-
ing in a corner and creates a turning moment
towards the outside of the bend. That turning
moment balances out the turning moment
acting in the opposite direction that is pro-
duced by the lateral forces, so that the vehicle
slightly understeers and thus remains easily
controllable (Fig. 6).

Control cycle for four-wheel-drive
 vehicles
The most important criteria for assessing the
various types of four-wheel-drive configura-
tion (Fig. 7) are traction, dynamic handling,
and braking characteristics. As soon as differ-
ential locks are engaged, conditions are cre-
ated that demand a different  response from
the ABS system. 

When a rear-axle differential is locked, the
rear wheels are rigidly interconnected, i.e.
they always rotate at the same speed and re-
spond to the braking forces (at each wheel)
and friction levels (between each tire and the
road surface) as if they were a single rigid
body. The “select low” mode that would
 otherwise be adopted for the rear wheels

7

Four-wheel-drive configurations

(whereby the wheel with the lower degree of
adhesion, µHF, determines the brake pressure
for both rear wheels) is thus canceled, and
both rear wheels utilize the maximum brak-
ing force. As soon as the inter-axle lock is en-
gaged, the system forces the front wheels to
assume the same average speed as the rear
wheels. All four wheels are then dynamically
interlinked and the engine drag (engine brak-
ing effect when backing off the throttle) and
inertia act on all four wheels. 

In order to ensure optimum ABS effectiveness
under those conditions, additional features
have to be incorporated according to the type
of four-wheel-drive system (Fig. 7) in use.

Four-wheel-drive system 1
On four-wheel-drive system 1 with manual
locks or permanently active viscous locks in
the propeller shaft and the rear-axle differen-
tial, the rear wheels are rigidly interconnected
and the average speed of the front wheels is
the same as that of the rear wheels. As already
mentioned, the rear differential lock results in
deactivation of the “select low” mode for the
rear wheels and utilization of the maximum
braking force at each rear wheel. When brak-
ing on road surfaces with unequal levels of
grip at the two rear wheels, this can generate a
yaw moment with a potentially critical effect
on vehicle handling stability. If the maximum
braking force difference were also applied
very quickly at the front wheels, it would not 
be possible to keep the vehicle on a stable
course. 

This type of four-wheel-drive arrangement
therefore requires a GMA system for the front
wheels in order to ensure handling stability
and steerability are maintained in road condi-
tions where there is a significant divergence
between the levels of grip at the left and right
wheels. In order to maintain ABS effective-
ness on slippery surfaces, the engine drag ef-
fect – which of course acts on all four wheels
on a four-wheel-drive vehicle – has to be 
reduced. This is done by using an engine
drag-torque control system that applies just
enough throttle to counteract the unwanted
engine braking effect.

Another factor that demands refinement of

the ABS control cycle in order to prevent
wheel lock-up is the reduced sensitivity of the
wheels to changes in road-surface adhesion
on slippery surfaces that is caused by the ef-
fect of the engine inertia. The fact that all
four wheels are dynamically linked to the en-
gine’s inertial mass therefore requires addi-
tional analysis and processing operations on
the part of the ABS control unit. The vehicle
longitudinal deceleration is calculated to de-
tect smooth or slippery road surfaces where
µHF is less than 0.3. 

When analyzing braking on such surfaces, the
response threshold (–a) for wheel decelera-
tion is halved and the diminishing rise in the
reference speed is limited to specific,  relatively
low levels. As a result, imminent wheel lock-
up can be detected early and “sensitively”.
On four-wheel-drive vehicles, heavy
 application of the throttle on slippery road
surfaces can cause all four wheels to spin. 
In such situations, special signal-processing
methods ensure that the reference speed can
only increase in response to the spinning
wheels within the limits of the maximum
possible vehicle acceleration. In a subsequent
braking sequence, the initial ABS pressure 
reduction is triggered by a signal (–a) and a
specific, minimal difference in wheel speed.

Four-wheel-drive system 2
Because of the possibility of all four wheels
spinning with four-wheel-drive system 2 
(viscous lock with freewheel in the propeller
shaft, proportional rear-axle differential
lock), the same special procedures must 
be adopted for signal processing. 

Other modifications for ensuring ABS ef-
fectiveness are not necessary as the freewheel
disengages the wheels under braking. How-
ever, the system can be improved by the use
of an engine drag-torque control system. 

Four-wheel-drive system 3 
As with the first two systems, four-wheel-
drive system 3 (automatic differential/inter-
axle locks) requires adoption of the signal
processing procedures described above in 
the event of wheel-spin at all four wheels. 
In addition, automatic release of the differen-
tial locks whenever the brakes are applied is
necessary. Other modifications for ensuring
ABS effectiveness are not necessary.

Antilock braking system Wheel-speed sensors

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors
A passive (inductive) speed sensor consists of
a permanent magnet (Fig. 2, 1) with a soft-
magnetic pole pin (3) connected to it, which
is inserted into a coil (2) with several thou-
sand windings. This setup generates a con-
stant magnetic field.

The pole pin is installed directly above 
the pulse wheel (4), a gear wheel attached to
the wheel hub. As the pulse wheel turns, the
continuously alternating sequence of teeth
and gaps induces corresponding fluctuations
in the constant magnetic field. This changes
the magnetic flux through the pole pin and
therefore also through the coil winding.
These fluctuations induce an alternating cur-
rent in the coil suitable for monitoring at the
ends of its winding. 

The frequency and amplitude of this alter-

nating current are proportional to wheel
speed (Fig. 3) and when the wheel is not
 rotating, the induced voltage is zero.

Tooth shape, air gap, rate of voltage rise,

and the ECU input sensitivity define the
smallest still measurable vehicle speed and
thus, for ABS applications, the minimum
 response sensitivity and switching speed. 

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors

Wheel-speed sensors

Application
Wheel-speed sensors are used to measure the
rotational speed of the vehicle wheels (wheel
speed). The speed signals are transmitted via
cables to the ABS, TCS or ESP control unit of
the vehicle which controls the braking force
individually at each wheel. This control loop
prevents the wheels from locking up (with
ABS) or from spinning (with TCS or ESP) so
that the vehicle’s  stability and steerability are
maintained.

Navigation systems also use the wheel

speed signals to calculate the distance traveled
(e. g. in tunnels or if satellite signals are un-
available).

Design and method of operation
The signals for the wheel-speed sensor are
generated by a steel pulse generator that is
fixed to the wheel hub (for passive sensors) 
or by a multipole magnetic pulse generator
(for active sensors). This pulse generator has
the same rotational speed as the wheel and
moves past the sensitive area of the sensor
head without touching it. The sensor “reads”
without direct contact via an air gap of up to
2 mm (Fig. 2).

The air gap (with strict tolerances) ensures

interference-free signal acquisition. Possible
interference caused for instance by oscillation
patterns in the vicinity of the brakes, vibra-
tions, temperature, moisture, installation
conditions at the wheel, etc. is therefore 
eliminated.

Since 1998 active wheel-speed sensors have
been used almost exclusively with new 
developments instead of passive (inductive)
wheel-speed sensors.

Various pole-pin configurations and installa-
tion options are available to adapt the system
to the different installation conditions en-
countered with various wheels. The most
common variants are the chisel-type pole pin
(Fig. 1a, also called a flat pole pin) and the
rhombus-type pole pin (Fig. 1b, also called 
a lozenge-shaped pole pin). Both pole-pin 
designs necessitate precise alignment to the
pulse wheel during installation. 

Active wheel-speed sensors
Sensor elements
Active wheel-speed sensors are used almost
exclusively in today’s modern brake systems
(Fig. 4). These sensors usually consist of 
a hermetic, plastic-cast silicon IC that sits 
in the sensor head. 

In addition to magnetoresistive ICs (the
electrical resistance changes as the magnetic
field changes) Bosch now uses Hall sensor el-
ements almost exclusively. These sensors react
to the smallest changes in the magnetic field
and therefore allow greater air gaps compared
to passive wheel-speed sensors.

Antilock braking system Wheel-speed sensors

Pulse wheels
A multipole ring is used as a pulse wheel for
active wheel-speed sensors. The multipole
ring consists of alternately magnetized plastic
elements that are arranged in the shape of a
ring on a nonmagnetic metal carrier (Fig. 6
and Fig. 7a). These north and south poles
adopt the function formerly performed by
the teeth of the pulse wheel. 
The IC of the sensor is located in the continu-
ously changing fields generated by these mag-
nets (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7a). The magnetic flux
through the IC therefore changes continu-
ously as the multipole ring turns.

A steel pulse wheel can also be used instead 
of the multipole ring. In this case a magnet 
is mounted on the Hall IC that generates 
a constant magnetic field (Fig. 7b). As the
pulse wheel turns, the continuously alter -
nating sequence of teeth and gaps induces
corresponding fluctuations in the constant
magnetic field. The measuring principle,
 signal processing and IC are otherwise
 identical to the sensor without a magnet.

Characteristics
A typical feature of the active wheel-speed
sensor is the integration of a Hall measuring
element, signal amplifier and signal condi-
tioning in an IC (Fig. 8). The wheel-speed
data is transferred as an impressed current 
in the form of square-wave pulses (Fig. 9).
The frequency of the pulses is proportional 
to the wheel speed and the speed can be
 detected until the wheel is practically
 stationary (0.1 km/h).

The supply voltage is between 4.5 and
20 volts. The square-wave output signal level
is 7 mA (low) and 14 mA (high).

This type of data-transmission using digital
signals is less sensitive to interference than the
signals from passive inductive sensors. The
sensor is connected to the ECU by a two-con-

Compact dimensions combine with low
weight to make the active wheel-speed  sensor
suitable for installation on and even within
the vehicle’s wheel-bearing assemblies (Fig.
10). Various standard sensor head shapes are
suitable for this.

Digital signal conditioning makes it possible
to transfer coded additional information us-
ing a pulse-width-modulated output signal
(Fig. 11):  
(cid:0) Direction of wheel rotation recognition:
This is especially significant for the “hill
hold control” feature, which relies on selec-
tive braking to prevent the vehicle from
rolling backwards when starting off on a
hill. The direction of rotation recognition
is also used in vehicle navigation systems. 

(cid:0) Standstill recognition: 

This information can also be evaluated 
by the “hill hold control” function. The in-
formation is also used for self-diagnosis.

(cid:0) Signal quality of the sensor: 

Information about the signal quality of the
sensor can be relayed in the signal. 
If a fault occurs the driver can be advised
that service is required.

Traction control system

Tasks, function description

Traction control system (TCS)

Critical driving situations can occur not only
while braking, but also whenever strong lon-
gitudinal forces should be transferred at the
contact area between the tire and the ground.
This is because the transferable lateral forces
are reduced by this process. Critical situa-
tions can also occur when starting off and 
accelerating, particularly on a slippery road
surface, on hills, and when cornering. These
kinds of situations can overtax the driver not
only causing him/her to react incorrectly but
also causing the vehicle to become unstable. 
The traction control system (TCS) solves
these problems, providing the vehicle
 remains within the physical limits.

Tasks 

The antilock braking system (ABS) prevents
the wheels from locking up when the brakes
are applied by lowering the wheel brake pres-
sures. The traction control system (TCS) pre-
vents the wheels from spinning by reducing
the drive torque at each driven wheel. TCS
therefore provides a logical extension of ABS
during acceleration. 

In addition to this safety-relevant task 
of ensuring the stability and steerability 
of the vehicle when accelerating, TCS also 
improves the traction of the vehicle by regu-

1

Drive concept of a single-axle driven vehicle with TCS

lating the optimum slip (see µ-slip curve in
“Basic principles of vehicle dynamics”). The
upper limit here is, of course, set by the trac-
tion requirement stipulated by the driver.

Function description

Unless otherwise stated, all the following de-
scriptions refer to single-axle driven vehicles
(Fig. 1). It makes no difference whether the
vehicle is rear-wheel or front-wheel drive.

Drive slip and what causes it 
If the driver presses the accelerator when the
clutch is engaged, the engine torque will rise.
The drive axle torque MKar also increases. This
torque is distributed to both driven wheels in a
ratio of 50 : 50 via the transversal differential
(Fig. 1). If this increased torque can be trans-
ferred completely to the road surface, the vehi-
cle will accelerate unhindered. However, if the
drive torque MKar/2 at one driven wheel ex-
ceeds the maximum drive torque that can be
transferred, the wheel will spin. The transfer-
able motive force is therefore  reduced and the
vehicle becomes unstable due to the loss of 
lateral stability.

The TCS regulates the slip of the driven
wheels as quickly as possible to the optimum
level. To do this the system first determines 
a reference value for the slip. This value
 depends on a number of factors which are 
intended to represent the current driving 
situation as closely as possible. These factors
include:
(cid:0) the basic characteristic for TCS reference

slip (based on the slip requirement of a tire
during acceleration),

(cid:0) effective coefficient of friction,
(cid:0) external tractive resistance (deep snow,

rough road, etc.),

(cid:0) yaw velocity, lateral acceleration, and steer-

ing angle of the vehicle.

TCS interventions
The measured wheel speeds and the respective
drive slip can be influenced by changing the
torque balance MGes at each driven wheel. 
The torque balance MGes at each wheel results
from the drive torque MKar/2 at this wheel, the
respective braking torque MBr and the road
torque MStr (Fig. 1).

MGes = MKar/2 + MBr + MStr
(MBr and MStr are negative here.)

This balance can obviously by influenced by
the drive torque MKar provided by the engine
as well as by the braking torque MBr. Both
these parameters are therefore correcting
variables of the TCS which can be used to
regulate the slip at each wheel to the reference
slip level. 

In gasoline-engine vehicles, the drive
torque MKar can be controlled using the
 following engine interventions:
(cid:0) Throttle valve (throttle valve adjustment),
(cid:0) Ignition system (ignition-timing advance),
(cid:0) Fuel-injection system (phasing out

 individual injection pulses).

Traction control system

Function description

95

The last two interventions are rapid 
interventions, the first a slower means of 
intervention (Fig. 2). The availability of 
these  interventions depends on the vehicle
manufacturer and engine version. 

In diesel-engine vehicles, the drive torque
MKar is influenced by the electronic diesel
control system (EDC) (reduction of the
quantity of fuel injected).

The braking torque MBr can be regulated 
for each wheel via the braking system. 
The TCS function requires the original ABS
 hydraulic system to be expanded because 
of the need for active pressure build-up 
(see also “Hydraulic modulator”). 

Fig. 2 compares the response times with
 various TCS interventions. The figure 
shows that exclusive drive torque regulation
by means of the throttle valve can be unsatis-
factory due to the relatively long response
time.

Traction control system

Structure of traction control system

Structure of traction control
system (TCS)

The expanded ABS hydraulic system allows
both symmetrical brake application (i. e.
brake application at both driven wheels) 
as well as individual brake application. This is
the key to further structuring of the TCS, i.e.
structuring according to controlled variable
rather than according to the actuator (en-
gine/brake).

Drive axle speed controller
The drive axle speed υKar or the drive torque
MKar can be influenced by means of engine
interventions. Symmetric brake applications
also influence the drive axle speed υKar and 
effect torque balance between the individual
wheels in the same way as reducing the drive
torque MKar. The drive axle speed controller
is used to regulate the drive axle speed in this
way.

Transversal differential lock controller
Asymmetric brake application (brake applica-
tion at just one driven wheel) is used primar-
ily to regulate the differential speed at the dri-
ven axle υDif = υL – υR. This task is carried out
by the differential speed controller. Asymmetric
brake application at just one driven wheel is

only noticeable at first in the torque balance of
this wheel. The brake application has basically
the same effect as an asymmetric distribution
ratio of the transversal differential (but ap-
plied to a drive torque MKar that is reduced by
the asymmetric braking torque). The differen-
tial speed controller is also referred to as the
transversal differential lock controller because it
can be used to influence to a certain extent the
distribution ratio of the transversal differen-
tial, i. e. to mimic the effect of a differential
lock.

Together the drive axle speed controller and
transversal differential lock controller form
the TCS system (Fig. 3). The drive axle speed
controller uses the drive axle speed υKar to
regulate the drive torque MKar provided by the
engine. The transversal differential lock con-
troller functions primarily like a controller
that uses the differential speed υDif to regulate
the distribution ratio ML to MR of the trans-
versal differential and therefore the distribu-
tion of the drive torque MKar to the driven
wheels.

Typical control situations

-Split: Transversal differential lock
 controller
Fig. 4 shows a typical situation (“µ-split”)
whereby the transversal differential lock con-
troller of the TCS becomes active when the
vehicle pulls away after being stationary. The
left side of the vehicle is on a slippery road
surface with a low coefficient of friction µl
(“l” for low) and the right side of the vehicle
is on dry asphalt with a considerably higher
coefficient of friction µh (“h” for high). 

Without brake application by the trans-
versal differential lock controller only the
drive force Fl could be transferred on both
sides since the differential distributes the
drive torque equally on both sides. A greater
drive torque MKar causes the wheel on the
side with µl to spin and leads to a differential
speed of υDif > 0 (see also Fig. 5). In this
case, the excess drive torque is lost as lost
torque in the differential, engine, and trans-
mission. 

To prevent the wheel on the side of the
 vehicle with µl from spinning if the drive
torque is too high, the braking force FBr
is applied (Fig. 4, see also Fig. 5). The differ-
ential can then transfer the force FBr + Fl to
this side (or a torque corresponding to this
force), whereby FBr is diffused by the brake
action. The drive force Fl remains as before.
On the side of the vehicle with µh the force

FBr + Fl is also transferred (characteristic 
of the differential). Since the brakes are not
applied on this side, the entire force can be
used as drive force FBr* + Fl (FBr* results
from FBr taking the different effective radii
into account). Overall the drive force trans-
ferred is increased by FBr* (the drive torque
MKar must of course also be increased ac-
cordingly). This ability of the transversal
 differential lock controller to increase the
traction is part of the traction control sys-
tem (TCS).

The drive torque can be regulated to a
maximum possible drive force. The value 
of µh represents a physical upper limit.

When both driven wheels run synchro-

nously again (υDif = 0), the single-sided
braking force FBr or the corresponding brak-
ing torque MBr is reduced again (Fig. 5).

The exact buildup and reduction of MBr de-
pends on the internal implementation of the
transversal differential lock controller (the
controller functions like a PI-controller).

Low : Drive axle speed controller
If both driven wheels are on a slippery road
surface with a low coefficient of friction 
(e.g. the vehicle is standing on ice) when 
the vehicle pulls away, the drive axle speed
controller of the TCS becomes active.

Traction control system

Typical control situations, traction control system for four wheel drive vehicles

If the driver increases the driver-specified
torque MFahVorga, the drive torque MKar in-
creases almost simultaneously. Both driven
wheels then spin at almost the same speed.
The differential speed υDif = υL – υR is ap-
proximately 0, while the drive axle speed 
υKar = (υL + υR)/2 = υL = υR is considerably
greater than a reasonable reference value
υSoKar determined by the TCS due to the 
spinning driven wheels. The drive axle 
speed controller reacts by reducing the drive
torque MKar to a level below the torque speci-
fied by the driver MFahVorga and by initiating
brief, symmetric brake application MBr, Sym
(Fig. 6). As a result the drive axle speed υKar is
reduced and thus the speed of the spinning
wheels. The vehicle begins to accelerate. Since
the optimum point of the µ-slip curve (see
also “Basic principles of vehicle dynamics”)
would not be achieved without these TCS in-
terventions, the acceleration would be slower
while the wheels were  spinning and consider-
ably less lateral  stability would be present.
The exact characteristic of MKar and
MBr, Sym depends in turn on the internal
 implementation of the drive axle speed
 controller (the controller functions like 
a PID-controller).

Traction control system (TCS)
for four wheel drive  vehicles

In recent years four wheel drive vehicles have
continued to increase in popularity. Amongst
these types of vehicles, Sport Utility Vehicles,
or SUVs, are the most popular of all. These
are road vehicles with off-road characteristics.
If all four wheels of a vehicle are to be dri-
ven, both a second transversal differential and
an additional longitudinal differential (also
called a central differential) are required 
(Fig. 7). The first task of the longitudinal dif-
ferential is to compensate for the differences
between the drive axle speed of the front and
rear axle υKar, VA and υKar, HA, respectively. 
A rigid connection would result in tension
between the front and rear axle. The second
task is to achieve optimum distribution of 
the drive torque MKar to the two axles MKar, VA
and MKar, HA, respectively.

Less expensive SUVs are often equipped with
a longitudinal differential with a preset distrib-
ution ratio. Unlike with a transversal differen-
tial, fixed distribution ratios other than 50:50
are useful – e.g. 60:40 for a design with em-
phasis on the rear-wheel drive of the vehicle.
Brake application by the traction control sys-
tem (TCS) can be used to mimic the behavior
of a longitudinal differential lock. 

By applying the brakes to eliminate part 
of MKar, VA, the distribution ratio MKar, HA to
MKar, VA can be increased, or can be decreased
by applying the brakes to eliminate part of
MKar, HA. The principle is the same as previ-
ously described for the transversal differential
lock or transversal differential. The only dif-
ference is that the braking torque of the TCS
does not have to be asymmetric, (i. e. at one
wheel of the driven axle) but can occur sym-
metrically at both wheels of a driven axle.
Moreover, the longitudinal differential lock
controller regards the two drive axle speeds
υKar, VA and υKar, HA as input parameters rather
than the speed difference of the left and right
wheel of the driven axle (transversal differen-
tial lock controller, see above).

Fig. 8 shows the expansion of the TCS
 concept from Fig. 3 for an all-wheel drive
 vehicle. As with a single-axle driven vehicle,
the drive axle speed controller uses the drive
axle speed υKar to regulate the drive torque
MKar provided by the engine. As already de-
scribed, the longitudinal differential lock
controller distributes this torque to the front
and rear axle (MKar, VA and MKar, HA, respec-
tively). The transversal
differential lock con-
troller uses the differ-
ential speed υDif, XA to
regulate the distribu-
tion of the drive
torque MKar, XA per axle

Traction control system

when the brakes overheat. Vehicles for these
conditions are therefore often fitted with 
mechanical locks (examples can be seen in
Figs. 9 and 10). The lock controllers of the
TCS software are then only used as a backup
system and they do not intervene during 
normal operation.

Basic principles of automotive control engineering

Many subsystems of a driving safety system
(e. g. ESP) influence the driving dynamics of 
a vehicle by means of a controller i. e., they
form a control loop together with the relevant
components of the vehicle. 

Control loop
A simple standard control loop consists 
of controllers and a controlled system. The
 objective is to influence the characteristic of
the parameter yactual (controlled variable) of 
the controlled system using the controller
such that the parameter follows a reference
characteristic yref as closely as possible. To do
this the controlled variable is measured and
passed to the controller. The actual value of
the controlled variable is constantly compared
with the current reference value by generating
the control variance e = yref – yactual. 

The main task of the controller is to deter-
mine a suitable value for the correcting vari-
able u for every control variance e so that the

control variance is decreased, i. e., yactual = yref
at least approximately.

This task may be made more difficult by
 unknown natural dynamics of the controlled
system and other external factors z, which also
influence the controlled system. 

Example: TCS transversal differential 
lock controller
The principle of a control loop can be ex-
plained using the transversal differential lock
controller of the TCS system as an example.
The controlled variable yactual = υDif is the differ-
ential speed of the two wheels of a driven axle.
The reference value υSoDif is determined by the
TCS and adapted to the current driving situa-
tion. When driving straight ahead, this value is
typically 0. The asymmetric braking torque is
used as a correcting variable to influence the
controlled variable. The controlled system is
the vehicle itself which is affected by external
influences such as changing road surfaces.

Time integration u(t) = KI · ∫e(t)dt

Time derivative u(t) = KD · de(t)/dt

The degree of counter-reaction of these
 controllers increases the greater the control
variance (P-controller), the longer the control
variance lasts (I-controller) or the greater the
tendency of the control variance to change 
(D-controller). Combining these basic con-
trollers gives PI, PD and PID-controllers.

The transversal differential lock controller of
the traction control system (TCS) is designed
as a PI-controller that contains additional non-
linear elements.

Electronic stability program

Requirements

Electronic stability program (ESP)

Human error is the cause for a large portion
of road accidents. Due to external circum-
stances, such as an obstacle suddenly appear-
ing on the road or driving at inappropriately
high speeds, the vehicle can reach its critical
limits and it becomes uncontrollable. The lat-
eral acceleration forces acting on the vehicle
reach values that overtax the driver. Elec-
tronic systems can make a major contribu-
tion towards increasing driving safety.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is 
a closed-loop system designed to improve ve-
hicle handling and braking response through
programmed intervention in the braking sys-
tem and/or drivetrain. The integrated func-
tionality of the ABS prevents the wheels from
locking when the brakes are applied, while
TCS inhibits wheel spin during acceleration.
In its role as an overall system, ESP applies a
unified, synergistic concept to control the ve-
hicle’s tendency to “plow” instead of obeying
the helm during attempted steering correc-
tions; and at the same time it maintains sta-
bility to prevent the vehicle breaking away to
the side, provided the  vehicle remains within
its physical limits.

Lateral dynamic response on passenger car without ESP 

Requirements

ESP enhances driving safety by providing the
following assets:
(cid:1) Enhanced vehicle stability; the system

keeps the vehicle on track and improves 
directional stability under all operating
conditions, including emergency stops,
standard braking maneuvers, coasting,
 acceleration, trailing throttle (overrun),
and load shift

(cid:1) Increased vehicle stability at the limits 

of traction, such as during sharp steering
maneuvers (panic response), to reduce the
danger of skidding or breakaway.

(cid:1) In a variety of different situations, further
improvements in the exploitation of trac-
tion potential when ABS and TCS come
into action, and when engine drag torque
control is active, by automatically increas-
ing engine speed to inhibit excessive engine
braking. The ultimate effects are shorter
braking distances and greater  traction
along with enhanced stability and higher
levels of steering response.

Tasks and method of operation

103

Tasks and method 
of operation 

The electronic stability program is a system
that relies on the vehicle’s braking system as a
tool for “steering” the vehicle. When the sta-
bility-control function assumes operation it
shifts the priorities that govern the brake sys-
tem. The basic function of the wheel brakes –
to decelerate and/or stop the vehicle – as-
sumes secondary importance as ESP inter-
venes to keep the vehicle stable and on
course, regardless of the conditions.

Specific braking intervention is directed 
at individual wheels, such as the inner rear
wheel to counter understeer, or the outer
front wheel during oversteer, as shown in 
Fig. 2. For optimal implementation of stabil-
ity objectives, ESP not only initiates braking
intervention, but it can also intervene on the
engine side to accelerate the  driven wheels. 

Because this “discriminatory” control concept
relies on two individual intervention strate-
gies, the system has two options for steering
the vehicle: it can brake selected wheels 
(selective braking) or accelerate the driven
wheels. Within the invariable limits imposed
by the laws of physics, ESP keeps the vehicle
on the road and reduces the risk of accident
and overturning. The system enhances road
safety by furnishing the driver with effective
support.

Below are four examples comparing vehicles
with and without ESP during operation “on
the limit”. Each of the portrayed driving ma-
neuvers reflects actual operating conditions,
and is based on simulation programs de-
signed using data from vehicle testing. The
results have been confirmed in subsequent
road tests.

Maneuvers

Rapid steering and countersteering
This maneuver is similar to lane changes 
or abrupt steering inputs such as might be
expected for instance
(cid:1) when a vehicle is moving too fast when 
it enters a series of consecutive S-bends,
(cid:1) or which have to be initiated when, with
oncoming traffic, an obstacle suddenly
appears on a country road, or

(cid:1) which are necessary when an overtaking
maneuver on the highway or freeway
 suddenly has to be aborted.

sponse of two vehicles (with and without
ESP) negotiating a series of S-bends with

(cid:1) on a high-traction road-surface
 (coefficient of friction µHF = 1),

(cid:1) without the driver braking,
(cid:1) with an initial speed of 144 km/h.

Initially, as they approach the S-bend, the
conditions for both vehicles, and their reac-
tions, are identical. Then come the first
steering inputs from the drivers (phase 1).

Vehicle without ESP
As can be seen, in the period following the
initial, abrupt steering input the vehicle
without ESP is already threatening to be-
come unstable (Fig. 4 on left, phase 2).
Whereas the steering input has quickly gen-
erated substantial lateral forces at the front
wheels, there is a delay before the rear
wheels start to generate similar forces. The
vehicle reacts with a clockwise movement
around its vertical axis (inward yaw). The
next stage is phase 3 with the second steer-
ing input. The vehicle without ESP fails to
respond to the driver’s attempt to counter-
steer and goes out of control. The yaw veloc-
ity and the side-slip angle rise radically, and
the vehicle breaks into a skid (phase 4).

Vehicle with ESP
On this vehicle ESP brakes the left front
wheel to counter the threat of instability
(Fig. 4 on right, phase 2) that follows the ini-
tial steering input. Within the ESP context
this is referred to as active braking, and it
proceeds without any intervention on the
driver’s part. This action reduces the ten-
dency to yaw toward the inside of the corner
(inward yaw). The yaw velocity is reduced
and the side-slip angle is limited. Following
the countersteer input, first the yaw moment
and then the yaw velocity reverse their direc-
tions (phase 3). In phase 4 a second brief
brake application – this time at the right
front wheel – restores complete stability. 
The vehicle remains on the course defined
by the steering-wheel angle.

When the last vehicle in a line of stopped

invisible to traffic approaching from behind,
drivers closing on the traffic jam cannot reg-

last second. Stopping the vehicle without col-

lane change as well as braking.

the complexity of the steering process and
lowers the demands placed on the driver. 
Yet another asset is that the ESP vehicle stops
in less distance than the vehicle equipped
with ABS alone.

Oversteering and understeering when cornering

1

Vehicle with ABS but without ESP
Immediately after the initial steering input
both the side-slip angle and the yaw velocity
have increased to the point where driver in-
tervention – in the form of countersteer – has
become imperative (Fig. 6, on
left). This driver action then
generates a side-slip angle in the
opposite direction (technically:
with the opposite operational
sign). This side-slip angle in-
creases rapidly, and the driver
must countersteer for a second
time. Here the driver is able –
but only just – to restabilize the
vehicle and bring it to a safe halt.

9

Vehicle with ESP
Because ESP reduces yaw veloc-
ity and side-slip angle to easily
controllable levels, this vehicle
remains stable at all times. The
driver is not confronted with
unanticipated instability and can
thus continue to devote full at-
tention to keeping the vehicle on
course. ESP substantially reduces

Extended steering and countersteering
sequence with progressively greater
 input angles
A vehicle traversing a series of S-curves (for
instance, on a snaking secondary road) is in 
a situation similar to that encountered on a
slalom course. The way the ESP works can be

10

Curves for dynamic response parameters for rapid
steering and countersteering inputs with increasing

clearly seen during this kind of dynamic 
maneuver when the steering wheel has to 
be turned to progressively greater angles to
negotiate each turn.

Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate the handling
 response of two vehicles (one with and 
one without ESP) under these conditions
(cid:1) on a snow-covered road (µHF = 0.45),
(cid:1) without the driver braking, and
(cid:1) at a constant velocity of 72 km/h.

Vehicle without ESP
Engine output will have to be increased con-
tinually in order to maintain a constant road
speed. This, in turn, will generate progressively
greater slip at the driven wheels. A sequence of
steering and countersteering maneuvers with a
40° steering-wheel angle can quickly increase
drive slip to such levels that a vehicle without
ESP becomes unstable. At some point in this
alternating sequence the vehicle suddenly
ceases to respond to steering inputs and breaks
into a slide. While lateral acceleration remains
virtually constant, both side-slip angle and yaw
velocity rise radically.

Vehicle with ESP
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) inter-
venes at an early stage in this sequence of
steering and countersteering maneuvers to
counter the instability that threatens right
from the outset. ESP relies on engine inter-
vention as well as individually controlled
braking of all four wheels to maintain the ve-
hicle’s stability and steering response. Side-
slip angle and yaw velocity are controlled so
that the driver’s steering demands can be
complied with as far as possible considering
the prevailing physical conditions.

Acceleration/deceleration during  cornering
A decreasing-radius curve becomes progres-
sively tighter as one proceeds. If a vehicle
maintains a constant velocity through such 
a curve (as frequently encountered on free-
way/highway exit ramps) the outward, or cen-
trifugal force, will increase at the same time
(Fig. 12). This also applies when the driver 
accelerates too soon while exiting a curve. 
In terms of the physics of vehicle operation, 
it produces the same effects as the situation de-
scribed above (Fig. 13). Excessive braking in
such a curve is yet another potential source of
radial and tangential forces capable of induc-
ing instability during cornering. 

A vehicle’s handling response during
 simultaneous acceleration and cornering 
is determined by testing on the skid pad
(semi-steady-state circulation). In this test the
driver gradually accelerates 
(cid:1) on a high-traction surface (µHF = 1.0) and
(cid:1) attempts to stay on a skid pad with a

100 meter radius while circulating at pro-
gressively faster rates; this continues until
the vehicle reaches its cornering limits.

Vehicle without ESP
During testing on the skid pad at approxi-
mately 95 km/h the vehicle responds to the im-
pending approach of its physical operating
limits by starting to understeer. The demand

for steering input starts to rise rapidly, while at
the same time the side-slip angle increases dra-
matically. This is the upper limit at which the
driver can still manage to keep the car  inside
the skid pad. A vehicle without ESP  enters its
unstable range at roughly 98 km/h. The rear
end breaks away and the driver must counter-
steer and leave the skid pad.

Vehicle with ESP
Up to a speed of roughly 95 km/h, vehicles
with and without ESP display identical re-
sponse patterns. Because this speed coincides
with the vehicle’s stability limit, the ESP refuses
to implement continued driver demand for
further acceleration to beyond this point. ESP
uses engine intervention to limit the drive
torque. Active engine and braking intervention
work against the tendency of the vehicle to un-
dersteer. This results in minor deviations from
the initially projected course, which the driver
can then correct with appropriate steering ac-
tion. At this point, the driver has assumed an
active role as an element within the control
loop. Subsequent fluctuations in steering-
wheel and side-slip angle will now be a func-
tion of the driver’s reactions, as will the final
speed of between 95 and 98 km/h as stipulated
for the test. The  vital factor is that ESP consis-
tently maintains these fluctuations within the
stable range.

Closed-loop control system

Electronic stability program concept
Application of the ESP closed-loop stability
control in the vehicle’s limit situation as de-
fined by the dynamics of vehicle motion is 
intended to prevent the
(cid:1) linear (longitudinal) velocity, the
(cid:1) lateral velocity and the
(cid:1) rotational speed around the vertical axis

(yaw velocity),

exceeding the ultimate control limits. Assum-
ing appropriate operator inputs, driver de-
mand is translated into dynamic vehicular re-
sponse that is adapted to the characteristics of
the road in an optimization process designed
to ensure maximum safety. As shown in Fig.
1, the first step is to determine how the vehi-
cle should respond to driver  demand during
operation in the limit range (ideal response),
and also how it actually does respond (actual
response). Actuators are then applied to mini-
mize the difference between the ideal and the
actual response (control deviation) by indi-
rectly influencing the forces acting at the
tires.

System and control structure
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP)
 embraces capabilities extending far beyond
those of either ABS or ABS and TCS com-
bined. Based on advanced versions of ABS
and ABS/TCS system components, it allows
active braking at all four wheels with a high
level of dynamic sensitivity. Vehicle response
is adopted as an element within the control
loop. The system controls braking, propulsive
and lateral forces so that the actual response
converges with the ideal response under the
given circumstances.

An engine-management system with CAN
interface can vary engine output torque in or-
der to adjust the driven-wheel slip rates. The
advanced ESP system provides highly precise
performance for selective adjustment of the
dynamic longitudinal and lateral forces acting
on each individual wheel.

Task
The ESP controller is responsible for
(cid:2) determining the current vehicle status

based on the yaw velocity signal and the
side-slip angle estimated by the “monitor”
and then

(cid:2) achieving maximum possible convergence
between vehicle response in the limit range
and its characteristics in the normal oper-
ating range (ideal response).

The following components register driver de-
mand and the system processes their signals
as the basis for defining ideal response:
(cid:2) engine-management system (e. g. pressure

on accelerator pedal),

(cid:2) primary-pressure sensor (e. g. activation of

(cid:2) steering-wheel sensor (steering-wheel

brakes), or 

 angle).

At this point the specified response is  defined
as driver demand. The coefficient of friction

2

ESP control loop in vehicle

and the vehicle speed are also  included in 
the processing calculations as  supplementary 
parameters. The “monitor” estimates these
factors based on signals transmitted by the
sensors for
(cid:2) wheel speed,
(cid:2) lateral acceleration,
(cid:2) braking pressures, and
(cid:2) yaw velocity.

The desired vehicle response is brought about
by generating a yaw moment acting on the
vehicle. In order to generate the desired yaw
moment, the controller intervenes in the tire-
slip rates to indirectly influence the longitudi-
nal and lateral forces. The system influences
the tire slip by varying the specifications for
slip rate, which must then be executed by the
subordinated ABS and TCS controllers.

The intervention process is designed to
maintain the handling characteristics that the
manufacturer intended the vehicle to have
and to serve as the basis for ensuring consis-
tently reliable control.

The ESP controller generates the specified

The specifications for side-slip angle and yaw
velocity are determined on the basis of the 
following parameters, which may be either 
directly or indirectly defined by driver input:
(cid:2) steering-wheel angle,
(cid:2) estimated vehicle speed,
(cid:2) coefficient of friction, which is determined
on the basis of the longitudinal acceleration
(estimated parameter) and lateral
 acceleration (measured parameter), and 
(cid:2) accelerator-pedal travel (engine torque) 
or brake-circuit pressure (force on brake
pedal).

These processes also take into account the
special characteristics related to vehicle dy-
namics, as well as unusual situations, such 
as a crowned road or µ-split surface (e.g. high
traction on left of lane with right side slip-
pery).

Method of Operation
The ESP controller governs the two status pa-
rameters “yaw velocity” and “side-slip  angle”
while calculating the yaw moment required to
make the actual and desired-state parameters
converge. As the side-slip angle increases, so
does its significance for the controller.

The control program is based upon data
concerning the maximum potential lateral 
acceleration and other data selected to reflect
the vehicle’s dynamic response patterns.
These are determined for each vehicle in
steady-state skid-pad testing. In subsequent
steady-state vehicle operation, as well as 
during braking and acceleration, this data –
defining how the steering angle and vehicle
speed relate to the yaw velocity – serves as the
basis for defining the desired vehicle  motion.
The required data (nominal yaw  velocity) is
stored in the program in the form of a single-
track model.

The nominal yaw velocity must be limited 
in line with the friction coefficient so as to
keep the vehicle on the predefined physically
feasible track.

For example, if a vehicle breaks into over-

steer while coasting into a right-handed

(cid:1)

Single-track model

Ranges of lateral acceleration

Passenger cars can achieve lateral accelera-
tions up to 10 m/s2. Lateral acceleration in the
small signal range (0...0.5 m/s2) can be caused
by road conditions such as ruts or by cross-
winds. 

The linear range extends from 0.5...4 m/s2.

Typical lateral maneuvers include changing 
lane or load-change reactions when cornering.
The response of the vehicle in these situations
can be described using the linear single-track
model. 

In the transition range (4...6 m/s2) some vehi-

cles still respond linearly while others do not. 

The critical range above 6 m/s2 is only

reached in extreme situations such as situations
that almost result in an accident. In this case
the vehicle response is highly non-linear.

Assumptions with the single-track model

The linear single-track model can be used to
obtain important information about the lateral
behavior of a vehicle. In the single-track model
the lateral properties of an axle and its wheels
are summarized into one effective wheel. In 
the simplest version, the properties taken into
account are modeled using linear equations;
thus the model is referred to as a linear single-
track model.

The most important model assumptions are:

(cid:2) Kinematics and elastokinematics of the axle

are only modeled linearly.

(cid:2) The lateral force buildup of the tire is linear

and the aligning torque is ignored.

(cid:2) The center of gravity is assumed to be at
road level. The only rotational degree of
 freedom of the vehicle is therefore the yaw
motion. Rolling, pitching and lifting (transla-
tional movements in z-axis) are not taken 
into account.

116

Electronic stability program

Closed-loop control system and controlled variables

curve, and the specified yaw velocity is ex-
ceeded (the vehicle evinces a tendency to
 rotate too quickly around its vertical axis),
ESP responds by braking the left front wheel
to generate a defined brake slip which shifts
the yaw moment toward greater counter-
clockwise rotation thus suppressing the
 vehicle’s tendency to break away.

If a vehicle breaks into understeer while
coasting into a right-handed curve, and the
yaw velocity is below the specified yaw rate
(the vehicle evinces a tendency to rotate too
slowly around its vertical axis), ESP responds
by braking the right rear wheel to generate 
a defined brake slip which shifts the yaw
 moment toward greater clockwise rotation
thus suppressing the vehicle’s tendency to
push over the front axle.

ESP controller functions during ABS and 
TCS operation
The entire spectrum of monitored and
 estimated data is relayed to the subordinate
controllers for continuous processing. This
guarantees maximum exploitation of the
traction available between tire and road sur-
face for the basic ABS and TCS functions 
under all operating conditions.

During active ABS operation (with wheels
tending to lock) the ESP controller provides
the subordinate ABS controller with the fol-
lowing data:
(cid:2) lateral vehicle velocity,
(cid:2) yaw velocity,
(cid:2) steering-wheel angle, and
(cid:2) wheel speeds as the foundation for
 providing the desired ABS slip.

When TCS is active (wheels threatening to
break into uncontrolled spin when moving
off or during rolling acceleration) the ESP
controller transmits the following offset
 values to the subordinate TCS controller:
(cid:2) change in the specified value for the 

(cid:2) change in the slip tolerance range, and
(cid:2) change in a value to influence the torque

drive-slip,

reduction.

Level 2 ABS controller
Task
The hierarchically subordinated ABS con-
troller goes into operation whenever the
 desired slip rate is exceeded during braking,
and it becomes necessary for ABS to inter-
vene. During both ABS and “active” braking,
the closed-loop control of wheel-slip rates 
as applied for various dynamic-intervention
functions must be as precise as possible. 
The system needs precise data on slip as a
precondition for dialing in the specified slip
rates. It must be pointed out that the system
does not measure the vehicle’s longitudinal
speed directly. Instead, this parameter is de-
rived from the rotation rates of the wheels.

Design and method of operation
By briefly “underbraking” one wheel, the ABS
controller performs an indirect measurement
of vehicle speed. It interrupts the slip control
to lower the current braking torque by a
 defined increment. The torque is then main-
tained at this level for a given period. Assum-
ing that the wheel has stabilized and is turn-
ing freely with no slip at the end of this pe-
riod, it can serve as a  suitable source for
 determining (no-slip) wheel speed.

The calculated velocity at the center of
gravity can be used to determine the effective
(free-rolling) wheel speeds at all four wheels.
These data, in turn, form the foundation for
calculating the actual slip rates at the remain-
ing three – controlled – wheels.

Level 2 engine drag-torque controller
(EDTC)
Task
Following downshifts and when the accelera-
tor is suddenly released, inertia in the engine’s
moving parts always exerts a degree of brak-
ing force at the drive wheels. Once this force
and the corresponding reactive torque rise
beyond a certain level, the tires will lose their
ability to transfer the resulting loads to the
road. Engine drag-torque control intervenes
under these conditions (by “gently” accelerat-
ing the engine).

Electronic stability program

Closed-loop control system and controlled variables

117

Design and method of operation
Factors such as variations in the character of
the road surface can lead to conditions under
which the engine-braking torque is suddenly
too high. The result is a tendency for the
wheels to lock. One available countermeasure
is judicious throttle application. Here, the
ECU transmits signals to trigger the corre-
sponding actuators in the engine-manage-
ment system (with ETC function) for an 
increase in drive torque. Intervention at the
engine-management level is employed to 
regulate the driven wheel within the pre-
scribed limits.

Level 2 TCS controller
Task
The hierarchically subordinated TCS con-
troller is triggered in case of excessive slip
during (for example) standing-start and dur-
ing rolling acceleration when it becomes nec-
essary for TCS to intervene. TCS is intended
to prevent the driven wheels from breaking
into a free spin. It functions by limiting en-
gine torque to a level corresponding to the
drive torque that the wheels can transfer to
the road surface.

Intervention at the driven wheels is carried

out by means of brake application or by in-
cluding the engine management system in the
process. In diesel-engine vehicles, the elec-
tronic diesel control system (EDC) reduces
the engine torque by modifying the quantity
of fuel injected. With gasoline-engines, the
engine torque can be reduced by varying the
throttle valve aperture (ETC), modifying the
ignition timing, or suppressing individual 
injection pulses. 

Active braking at non-driven wheels is gov-

erned directly by the ABS controller.  Unlike
with ABS, TCS receives values from the ESP
controller for changing the specified slip 
and permissible slip difference of the driven
axle(s). These changes take effect in the form
of an offset applied to the basic values defined
in the TCS.

Design
The specified propshaft speed and wheel-
speed differential data are calculated from the
specified slip values and speeds for the “coast-
ing” wheels. The propshaft speed and wheel-
speed differential controlled variables are 
derived from the driven wheel speeds.

Method of Operation
The TCS module calculates the desired brak-
ing torque for both driven wheels and the 
desired value for engine torque reduction to
be implemented by the engine-management
system.

Because the propshaft speed is affected 

by inertial forces originating from the
 drivetrain as a whole (engine, transmission,
 driven wheels, and the propshaft itself), a 
relatively large time constant is employed 
to  describe its corresponding leisurely rate 
of dynamic response. In contrast, the time
 constant for the wheel-speed differential is
relatively small, reflecting the fact that the
wheels’ own inertial forces are virtually the
sole determining factor for their dynamic
 response. Another relevant factor is that the
wheel-speed differential – unlike propshaft
speed – is not affected by the engine.

The torques prescribed for the propshaft
and wheel-speed differential are taken as the
basis for defining the actuators’ positioning
forces. The system achieves the specified dif-
ference in braking torque between the left and
right-side driven wheels by transmitting the
appropriate control signals to valves in the
hydraulic modulator.

Propshaft torques are regulated to the
 desired level using symmetrical braking as
well as engine intervention. With a gasoline-
engine, adjustments undertaken through the
throttle valve are relatively slow to take effect
(lag and the engine’s transition response). Re-
tarding the ignition timing and, as a  further
option, selective suppression of  injection
pulses are employed for rapid engine-based
intervention, while symmetrical braking can
be applied for brief transitional support of
engine torque reduction.

Applications
In vehicles with Electronic Stability Program
(ESP), the rotation of the vehicle about its
vertical axis is registered by micromechanical
yaw-rate (or yaw-speed) sensors (also known
as gyrometers) and applied for vehicle-dy-
namics control. This takes place during nor-
mal cornering, but also when the  vehicle
breaks away or goes into a skid.

These sensors are reasonably priced as well

as being very compact. They are in the
process of forcing out the conventional high-
precision mechanical sensors.

Structure of the MM1 yaw-rate sensor

200   m

Design and construction
MM1 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
A mixed form of technology is applied in
 order to achieve the high accuracies needed
for vehicle-dynamics systems. That is, two
somewhat thicker oscillating elements (mass
plates) which have been machined from a
wafer using bulk micromechanics oscillate in
counter-phase to their resonant frequency
which is defined by their mass and their 
coupling springs (>2 kHz). On each of these
oscillating elements, there is a miniature, 
surface-type micromechanical capacitive
 acceleration sensor. When the sensor chip 
rotates about its vertical axis at yaw rate Ω,
these register the Coriolis acceleration in the
wafer plane vertical to the direction of oscilla-
tion (Figs. 1 and 2). These accelerations are
proportional to the product of yaw rate and
and the oscillatory velocity which is main-
tained electronically at a constant value. 

To drive the sensor, all that is required is a
simple, current-carrying printed conductor
on each oscillating element. In the perma-
nent-magnet field B vertical to the chip sur-
face, this oscillating element is subjected to an
electrodynamic (Lorentz) force. Using a fur-
ther, simple printed conductor (which saves
on chip surface), the same magnetic field is
used to directly measure the oscillation veloc-
ity by inductive means. The different physical

To avoid excessive damping of this move-
ment, the sensor must be operated in a vac-
uum. Although the chip’s small size and the
somewhat simpler production process  result
in considerable cost reductions, this minia-
turisation is at the expense of reductions in
the measuring effect, which in any case is not
very pronounced, and therefore of the achiev-
able precision. It also places more severe de-
mands on the electronics. The system’s high
flexural stability, and mounting in the axis of
gravity, serve to mechanically suppress the ef-
fects of unwanted acceleration from the side.

tem serves to avoid undesirable coupling be-
tween the two sections. In order to suppress
unwanted external acceleration effects, the
opposing sensor signals are subtracted from
each other. The external acceleration effects
can be measured by applying summation.
The high-precision micromechanical con-
struction helps to suppress the effects of high
oscillatory acceleration which is several fac-
tors of 10 higher than the low-level Coriolis
acceleration (cross sensitivity far below 
40 dB). Here, the drive and measurement 
systems are rigorously decoupled from each
other. 

MM2 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
Whereas this silicon yaw-rate sensor is pro-
duced completely using surface-microme-
chanic techniques, and the magnetic drive
and control system have been superseded by
an electrostatic system, absolute decoupling
of the power/drive system and measuring 
system is impossible. Comb-like structures
(Figs. 3 and 4) electrostatically force a cen-
trally mounted rotary oscillator to oscillate.
The amplitude of these oscillations is held
constant by means of a similar capacitive
pick-off. Coriolis forces result at the same
time in an out-of-plane tilting movement, 
the amplitude of which is proportional to the
yaw rate Ω, and which is detected capacitively
by the electrodes underneath the  oscillator.

Electronic stability program

Steering-wheel-angle sensors

Steering-wheel-angle  sensors

Application
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) ap-
plies the brakes selectively to the individual
wheels in order to keep the vehicle on the
 desired track selected by the driver. Here, the
steering-wheel angle and the applied braking
pressure are compared with the vehicle’s ac-
tual rotary motion (around its vertical axis)
and its road speed. If necessary, the brakes are
applied at individual wheels. These measures
serve to keep the float angle (deviation be-
tween the vehicle axis and the actual vehicle
movement) down to a minimum and, until
the physical limits are reached, prevent the
vehicle breaking away. 

Basically speaking, practically all types of
angle-of-rotation sensors are suitable for reg-
istering the steering-wheel angle. Safety con-
siderations, though, dictate that only those
types are used which can be easily checked for
plausibility, or which in the ideal case auto-
matically check themselves. Potentiometer
principles are used, as well as optical code-
registration and magnetic principles. Whereas
a passenger-car steering wheel turns through
±720° (a total of 4 complete turns), conven-
tional angle-of-rotation sensors can only
measure maximum 360°. This means that
with the majority of the sensors actually used
for this purpose it is necessary to continually
register and store the data on the steering
wheel’s actual setting. 

Design and operating concept
There are two absolute-measuring (in con-
trast to incremental-measuring) magnetic 
angle-of-rotation sensors available which are
matched to the Bosch ECUs. At any instant in
time, these sensors can output the steering-
wheel angle throughout the complete angular
range. 

Hall-effect steering-wheel-angle sensor
(LWS1)
The LWS1 uses 14 Hall-effect vane switches 
to register the angle and the rotations of the
steering wheel. The Hall-effect vane switch is

similar in operation to a light barrier. A Hall-
effect element measures the magnetic field of
an adjacent magnet. A magnetic code disc ro-
tates with the steering shaft and strongly re-
duces the magnet’s field or screens it off com-
pletely. In this manner, with nine Hall ICs it is
possible to obtain the steering wheel’s angular
position in digital form. The remaining five
Hall-effect sensors register the particular
steering-wheel revolution which is trans-
formed to the final 360° range by 4:1 step-
down gearing. 

The first item from the top in the exploded
view of the LWS 1 steering-wheel-angle sensor
(Fig. 1) shows the nine permanent magnets.
These are screened individually by the magneti-
cally-soft code disc beneath them when this ro-
tates along with the steering shaft, and depend-
ing upon steering-wheel movement. The PCB

which plausibility tests are performed and 
information on angular position decoded 
and conditioned ready for the CAN-Bus. 
The bottom half of the assembly contains 
the step-down gearing and the remaining five
Hall-effect vane switches.

The LWS1 was superseded by the LWS3
due to the large number of sensor elements
required, together with the necessity for the
magnets to be aligned with the Hall-IC.

Magnetoresistive steering-wheel-angle  sensor
LWS3
The LWS 3 also depends upon AMR (aniso -
tropic magnetoresistive sensors) for its opera-
tion. The AMR’s electrical resistance changes
according to the direction of an external mag-
netic field. In the LWS3, the information on
angle across a range of four complete rota-
tions is provided by measuring the angles of
two gearwheels which are rotated by a third
gearwheel on the steering-column shaft. The
first two gearwheels differ by one tooth which
means that a definite pair of  angular variables
is associated with every possible steering-
wheel position. 

By applying a mathematical algorithm (a
computing process which follows a defined
step-by-step procedure) referred to here as a
modified vernier principle, it is possible to
use the above AMR method for calculating
the steering-wheel angle in a microcomputer.
Here, even the measuring inaccuracy of the
two AMR sensors can be compensated for. 
In addition, a self-check can also be imple-
mented so that a highly plausible measured
value can be sent to the ECU. 

Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation 
of the LWS3 steering-wheel-angle sensor. The
two gearwheels, with magnets inserted, can

togther with the evaluation electronics. With
this design too, price pressure forces the devel-

ing concepts. In this respect, investigation is
proceeding on whether, since it only measures
up to 360°, a single AMR angle-of-rotation 
sensor (LWS4) on the end of the steering shaft
would be accurate enough for ESP (Fig. 4).

Applications
Vehicles equipped with the Antilock Braking
System ABS, the Traction Control System
TCS, all-wheel drive, and/or Electronic Stabil-
ity Program ESP, also have a Hall-effect accel-
eration sensor in addition to the wheel-speed
sensors. This measures the vehicle’s longitudi-
nal and transverse accelerations (depending
upon installation position  referred to the 
direction of travel). 

1

Hall-effect acceleration sensor (opened)

Design and construction
A resiliently mounted spring-mass system is
used in the Hall-effect acceleration sensors
(Figs. 1 and 2).

It comprises an edgewise-mounted strip
spring (3) tightly clamped at one end. At-
tached to its other end is a permanent magnet
(2) which acts as the seismic mass. The actual
Hall-effect sensor (1) is located above the
permanent magnet together with the evalua-
tion electronics. There is a small  copper
damping plate (4) underneath the magnet.

Operating concept
When the sensor is subjected to acceleration
which is lateral to the spring, the spring-mass
system changes its neutral position accord-
ingly. Its deflection is a measure for the accel-
eration. The magnetic flux F from the mov-
ing magnet generates a Hall voltage UH in 
the Hall-effect sensor. The output voltage UA
from the evaluation circuit is derived from
this Hall voltage and climbs linearly along
with acceleration (Fig. 3, measuring range 
approx. 1 g). 

This sensor is designed for a narrow band-
width of several Hz and is electrodynamically
damped.

Miniaturization

Thanks to micromechanics it has become possi-
ble to locate sensor functions in the smallest
possible space. Typically, the mechanical dimen-
sions are in the micrometer range. Silicon, with
its characteristics has proved to be a highly suit-
able material for the production of the very small,
and often very intricate mechanical structures.
With its elasticity and electrical properties,
 silicon is practically ideal for the production of
sensors. Using processes derived from the field
of semiconductor engineering, mechanical and
electronic functions can be integrated with each
other on a single chip or using other methods.

Micromechanical acceleration sensor

Bosch was the first to introduce a product
with a micromechanical measuring element 
for automotive applications. 

This was an intake-pressure sensor for mea-
suring load, and went into series production 
in 1994. Micromechanical acceleration and
yaw-rate sensors are more recent develop-
ments in the field of miniaturisation, and are
used in driving-safety systems for occupant
protection and vehicle dynamics control
 (Electronic Stability Program ESP). The
 illustrations below show quite clearly just 
how small such components really are.

Automatic brake functions

Overview

Automatic brake functions

The possibilities of today’s electronic brake
systems go far beyond the tasks for which
they were originally designed. Originally the
antilock braking system (ABS) was only used
to prevent the wheels of a vehicle from lock-
ing up and therefore to ensure the steerabil-
ity of the vehicle even during emergency
braking. Today, the brake system also con-
trols the distribution of the braking-force.
The electronic stability program (ESP), with
its ability to build up brake pressure inde-
pendently of the position of the brake pedal,
offers a whole series of possibilities for active
brake intervention. The ESP is intended to
assist the driver by applying the brakes auto-
matically and to therefore provide the driver
with a higher level of comfort and conve-
nience. Some functions, however, enhance
the vehicle safety since automatic brake 
application during an emergency results in
shorter braking distances. 

Overview

The main function of the electronic brake
system is the Electronic Braking-force Distri-
bution (EBD) function which replaces the
mechanical components for braking-force
distribution between the front and rear axles.
This function not only cuts costs, but also
makes the electronic distribution of the 
braking force extremely flexible.

Additional functions are gradually being

integrated into electronic brake systems. 
The following additional functions are
 currently available:
(cid:1) Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA):

HBA detects emergency braking situations
and shortens the braking distance by build-
ing up the brake pressure up to the wheel-
lock limit.

(cid:1) Controlled Deceleration for Parking Brake

(CDP):
CDP brakes the vehicle until it is stationary
when requested by the driver.

(cid:1) Hill Hold Control (HHC):

(cid:1) Brake Disk Wiping (BDW):

BDW removes splash water from the brake
disks by briefly applying the brakes. This
brake application is not noticed by the 
driver.

These functions work together with the 
Electronic Stability Program (ESP). Some 
of these functions may also be available 
with the Antilock Braking System (ABS) 
or the Traction Control System (TCS).

Most of the additional functions operate

with the sensor technology of the existing
electronic brake systems. Some functions,
however, require additional sensors.

HHC intervenes in the brake system when
pulling away on a hill and prevents the
 vehicle from rolling backwards.

(cid:1) Hill Descent Control (HDC):

HDC assists the driver when driving down-
hill on steep terrain by automatically 
applying the brakes.

(cid:1) Controlled Deceleration for Driver  Assistance

Systems (CDD):
CDD brakes the vehicle if required in 
combination with automatic vehicle- 
to-vehicle ranging.

(cid:1) Hydraulic Fading Compensation (HFC):

HFC intervenes if the maximum possible
vehicle deceleration is not achieved even
though the driver is forcefully pressing the
brake pedal, e. g. due to high brake disk
temperatures.

(cid:1) Hydraulic Rear Wheel Boost (HRB):

HRB also increases the brake pressure in
the rear wheels up to the wheel-lock limit
during ABS brake application.

Electronic Braking-force Distribution
(EBD)
Requirements
Legal requirements demand that the braking
systems of road vehicles are designed in such
a way that they ensure a deceleration up to of
0.83g 1) and provide stable driving behavior
during all types of maneuvers so that the ve-
hicle does not exhibit unstable handling char-
acteristics (i. e. a tendency to skid). 

Conventional Braking-force Distribution
On vehicles without ABS, this is achieved by a
fixed braking-force distribution between the
front and rear brakes or by the use of propor-
tioning valves for the rear brakes (Fig. 1). 
Curve 2 shows the pattern for a vehicle
with a fixed braking-force distribution which,
within the range 0...0.83g is below the ideal
braking-force distribution curve (1l) for an
unladen vehicle and fails to utilize the poten-
tial for higher rear-wheel braking forces. With
a fully laden vehicle, (curve 1b), the utiliza-
tion of potential is even lower. Curve 3 illus-
trates the characteristic obtained by using a
proportioning valve, whereby a significant
gain in rear-wheel braking force is obtained
in an unladen vehicle. With the vehicle fully
laden, however, the im-
provement is relatively
small. 

1

This latter character-

istic can be improved
by the use of load-de-
pendent or decelera-
tion-dependent propor-
tioning valves, but at
the cost of complex me-
chanics and hydraulics.

Electronic distribution
Electronic Braking-force Distribution (EBD)
allows the distribution between front and rear
brakes to be adjusted according to conditions.
Handling response is continuously monitored
and a greater proportion of the overall brak-
ing force can be applied to the rear brakes
when conditions allow because the propor-
tioning valve is dispensed with or else larger
dimensioned rear wheel brakes are fitted.
This releases additional braking potential for
the front wheels which can be utilized on 
vehicles with a high forward weight bias in
particular. 

Design
The vehicle is designed in such a way that
without a proportioning valve, the fixed brak-
ing-force distribution curve intersects the
ideal braking-force distribution curve (curve
1) at a point P (Fig. 2) at a lower overall brak-
ing force, e.g. 0.5g. The use of the existing
ABS system’s hydraulics, sensors and elec-
tronics, but with modified valves and soft-
ware, allows the braking force at the rear
wheels to be reduced at higher overall braking
levels.

Method of operation 
The ECU continuously calculates the slip dif-
ference between the front and rear wheels in
all driving situations. If the ratio of front to
rear wheel slip exceeds a defined stable-han-
dling threshold when braking, the ABS pres-
sure inlet valve for the appropriate rear wheel
is closed. This prevents further increase of
brake pressure at that wheel.

If the driver then further increases the force

applied to the brake pedal, and therefore the
brake pressure, the degree of slip at the front
wheels also increases. The difference between
front and rear wheel slip  diminishes and the
pressure inlet valve is opened again so that the
pressure at the rear wheel rises once more. This
process may then be repeated a number of
times depending on the brake pedal force and
the maneuver being performed. The electronic
braking-force distribution curve then takes on
a staircase appearance (curve 3) which approx-
imates to the ideal braking-force distribution
curve.

For the Electronic Braking-force Distribution
(EBD) function, only the rear-brake valves of

the ABS system are activated, the return
pump motor in the hydraulic modulator unit
remains de-energized.  

Advantages
The characteristics of the EBD system
 outlined above provide the following

(cid:1) Optimized vehicle handling stability under
all payload conditions, in all cornering 
situations, on uphill or downhill gradients,
and in any drivetrain status (clutch engaged/
disengaged, automatic transmission),
(cid:1) No need for conventional proportioning

valves or limiting valves,

Automatic brake functions

Additional functions

Additional functions

Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA)
The main task of the hydraulic brake assist 
is to detect an emergency braking situation
and as a result to automatically increase the
vehicle deceleration. The vehicle deceleration
is only limited by the intervention of ABS
control and is therefore close to the optimum
level possible within physical limits. A normal
driver is therefore able to achieve the short
braking distances that could previously only
be achieved by specially trained drivers. If the
driver reduces the desired level of braking,
the vehicle deceleration is reduced in accor-
dance with the force applied to the brake
pedal. The driver can therefore precisely
modulate the vehicle deceleration when the
emergency braking situation has passed.
The driver’s desired level of braking is
 determined by the force or pressure he/she
applies to the brake pedal. The pedal pressure
is derived from the measured master cylinder
pressure taking into account the current hy-
draulic control.

The driver can intervene in the brake applica-
tion at any time and can therefore directly in-
fluence the vehicle’s response. The HBA can
only increase the brake pressure. The primary
pressure applied by the driver is therefore the
minimum pressure used by the system. If a
system error occurs, the HBA is shutoff and
the driver is informed that an error has 
occurred.

Controlled Deceleration for Parking
Brake CDP
The Electromechanical Parking Brake (EPB)
is an automated parking brake system. It
 replaces the conventional hand brake lever 
or foot-operated parking brake lever with 
an electric motor. The disadvantage of the
parking brake is that it only affects the rear
axle and its braking force is limited in the
event of emergency braking. The CDP func-
tion increases braking deceleration and si-
multaneously enables an ESP system con-
troller to be used to ensure vehicle stability.  

The CDP function is an additional function
to actively increase the brake pressure in vehi-
cles fitted with an hydraulic braking system
and ESP system. On the driver’s request, the
CDP function automatically decelerates the
vehicle until it is stationary. Once the  vehicle
has come to a standstill, the ESP  hydraulics
system briefly adopts all static parking brake
processes.

Hill Hold Control HHC
The Hill Hold Control (HHC) starting-off
assistant is a comfort and convenience func-
tion that prevents the vehicle from rolling
backwards when pulling away on hills and 
inclines. The gradient of the hill or slope 
is measured by a tilt sensor (longitudinal
 acceleration sensor). To operate, the starting-
off assistant requires the brake pressure avail-
able when the vehicle is stationary that was
built up when the driver pressed the foot
brake.

The brake pressure specified by the driver
when stopping the vehicle is maintained in
the brake system when the system detects that
the vehicle is stationary, even if the driver re-
leases the brake pedal. The brake pressure is
reduced after a pressure holding time of up 
to a maximum of two seconds. During this
time the driver can press the accelerator pedal
and pull away. The brake pressure is reduced
when the system detects the driver’s intention
to pull away.

The system detects that the driver wishes to
pull away if the engine torque is sufficient for
the vehicle to move in the desired direction.
This state can be triggered by the driver press-
ing the accelerator pedal and/or clutch as well

Activation
• Stop on an incline (> approx. 2%)

• Engage 1st gear
  (if front of vehicle is facing uphill)
• Engage reverse gear
  (if rear of vehicle is facing uphill)

as by the transmission outputting an engine
torque (e. g. automatic/continuously variable
transmission). 

The brake pressure is not maintained in the
brake system if there is already sufficient 
engine torque when the vehicle is stationary
(e.g. due to the accelerative force of the
 automatic transmission).

If the driver presses the accelerator pedal

during the vehicle-specific holding time, 
the holding time is extended until sufficient
engine torque is available for the vehicle to
pull away.

If the driver does not press the accelerator
or the brake pedal, the function is deactivated
at the latest after two seconds. The  vehicle
then starts rolling.

The HHC function is also designed as an
 additional function for the ESP system and 
it uses parts of this system. The function is
activated automatically.

Automatic brake functions

Additional functions

Hill Descent Control HDC
The Hill Descent Control (HDC) is a comfort
and convenience function that assists the dri-
ver when driving down hill (on gradients of
up to 50%) by automatically applying the
brakes. Once this function is activated a pre-
determined, low desired-speed is introduced
and regulated without any necessary inter-
vention from the driver.

The driver must activate and deactivate the

HDC function by pressing the HDC push-
button.

If required the driver can vary the predeter-
mined speed by pressing the brake and accel-
erator pedal or using the control buttons of a
speed control system.

If the brake slip of the wheels is too high dur-
ing HDC control, the ABS system intervenes
automatically. If the wheels are on different
road surfaces, the braking torque of the slip-
ping wheels is automatically distributed to
the wheels with a higher coefficient of fric-
tion.

If engine braking torque is available it is
used automatically. Compared to the exclu-
sive use of engine braking torque in order to
maintain the vehicle speed, the HDC func-
tion has the advantages that if the wheels
leave the surface of the road (loss of engine
braking torque) the vehicle speed is main-
tained and sudden acceleration phases do not
occur.

Another advantage of the HDC function is
the variable distribution of the braking force
which is coupled to the automatic driving di-
rection recognition function. When reversing
the rear axle is braked more forcefully to en-
sure optimum steerability even if the front
axle is relieved of the load.

The level ground detection function inte-
grated in the HDC only permits brake appli-
cation by the HDC when driving downhill. 
If the vehicle is on the flat or driving uphill,
the HDC switches to a standby mode and 
is reactivated automatically as soon as the 
system detects that the vehicle is traveling
downhill.

To prevent the driver misusing this func-

tion, the HDC also switches to its standby
mode if the accelerator pedal is pressed
passed a certain threshold or if the vehicle 
exceeds a maximum control speed. The 
HDC function is deactivated if the vehicle 
accelerates beyond a preset cutoff-speed.

The status of the HDC function is indicated
by the HDC indicator lamp. The brake lamp
indicates when the HDC function applies the
brakes.

Controlled Deceleration for Driver
 Assistance Systems CDD
The basic CDD function is an additional
function for active brake application with the
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), i. e. for auto-
matic vehicle-to-vehicle ranging. The brakes
are applied automatically without the driver
pressing the brake pedal as soon as the dis-
tance to the vehicle in front falls below a pre-
determined distance. CDD is based on a hy-
draulic braking system and an ESP system.

The CDD function receives a request to
 decelerate the vehicle by a desired amount
(input). CDD then sends the actual amount
of deceleration (output) which is achieved by
controlling the pressure using hydraulics. The
requested amount of deceleration is specified
by the cruise control system which is con-
nected upstream. 

Hydraulic Fading Compensation HFC
The Hydraulic Fading Compensation (HFC)
function offers the driver additional brake
servo assistance. The function is activated if
the maximum possible vehicle deceleration 
is not achieved even if the driver forcefully
presses the brake pedal to the point that
would normally cause the lockup pressure to
be reached (primary pressure over approx. 
80 bar). This is the case, for example at high
brake disk temperatures or if the brake pads
have a considerably reduced coefficient of
friction. 

When the HFC is activated, the wheel pres-

sures are increased until all wheels have
reached the lockup pressure level and ABS
control is initiated. The brake application is
therefore at the physical optimum. The pres-
sure in the wheel-brake cylinders can then 
exceed the pressure in the master cylinder,
also during ABS control.

If the driver reduces the desired level of brak-

ing to a value below a particular threshold
value, the vehicle deceleration is reduced in ac-
cordance with the force applied to the brake
pedal. The driver can therefore precisely modu-
late the vehicle deceleration when the braking
situation has passed. The HFC cuts off if the
primary pressure or vehicle speed falls below
the respective cutoff threshold.

Automatic brake functions

Additional functions

Hydraulic Rear Wheel Boost HRB
The Hydraulic Rear wheel Boost (HRB) pro-
vides the driver with additional brake servo
assistance for the rear wheels if the front
wheels are controlled by the ABS system. 
This function was introduced because many
drivers do not increase the pedal force at 
the start of ABS control even though the 
situation would require this. When the HRB
function is active, the wheel pressures are
 increased at the rear wheels until they also
reach the lockup pressure and ABS control is
initiated. The brake application is therefore 
at the physical optimum. The pressure in 
the rear axle wheel-brake cylinders can then
exceed the pressure in the master cylinder,
also during ABS control. 

The HRB cuts off when the wheels at the
front axle are no longer under ABS control or
when the primary pressure falls below the
cutoff threshold.

Brake Disk Wiping BDW
The Brake Disk Wiping (BDW) function de-
tects rain or a wet road by evaluating wind-
shield wiper or rain sensor signals and then
actively increases the brake pressure in the
service brake. The brake pressure buildup is
used to remove splash water from the disk
brake to ensure minimum brake response
times when driving in wet conditions. The
pressure level when dry-braking is adjusted 
so that the vehicle deceleration cannot be
perceived by the driver.

Dry-braking is repeated at a defined inter-

val for as long as the system detects rain or 
a wet road. If required just the disks at the
front axle can be wiped.

The BDW function interrupts the wiping
procedure as soon as the driver applies the
brakes.

Directional stability

133

(cid:0)

Directional stability

Satisfactory handling is defined according to
whether a vehicle maintains a path that accu-
rately reflects the steering angle while at the
same time remaining stable. To meet this sta-
bility criterion, the vehicle must remain consis-
tently secure and sure-footed, without “plow-
ing” or breaking away.

Dynamic lateral response is a critical factor
in the overall equation. The response pattern
is defined based on the vehicle’s lateral mo-
tion (characterized by the side-slip angle) and
its tendency to rotate around its vertical axis
(yaw velocity) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 2 illustrates the dynamic lateral response
of a vehicle being driven with a fixed steering
angle (skid-pad circulation). Position 1 repre-
sents the instant when steering input is ap-
plied. Curve 2 is the vehicle’s subsequent
course on a high-grip road surface; this track
is an accurate reflection of the steering angle.
This is the case when the coefficient of friction
is sufficient to transfer the lateral acceleration
forces to the road surface. If the coefficient of
friction is lower e.g. due to a slippery road sur-

1

face, the side-slip angle becomes excessive
(curve 3). Although with a controlled yaw ve-
locity the vehicle will rotate just as far around
its vertical axis as in curve 2, the larger side-
slip angle is now a potential source of instabil-
ity. For this reason the electronic stability pro-
gram controls the yaw velocity and limits the
side-slip angle (cid:0) (curve 4).

Hydraulic modulator

Development history

Hydraulic modulator

The hydraulic modulator forms the hy-
draulic connection between the master cylin-
der and the wheel-brake cylinders and is
therefore the central component of elec-
tronic brake systems. It converts the control
commands of the electronic control unit and
uses solenoid valves to control the  pressures
in the wheel brakes. 

A distinction is made between systems that
modulate the brake pressure applied by the
driver (Antilock Braking System, (ABS)) and
systems that can build-up pressure automati-
cally (Traction Control System (TCS) and
Electronic Stability Program (ESP)). 
All systems are only available as dual-circuit
versions for legal reasons.

Development history

The transition from 3/3 to 2/2 solenoid valve
was a milestone in the development of ABS.
With 3/3 valves, which were used in genera-
tion 2, the control functions for building up,
maintaining and reducing pressure could be
carried out using just one valve. The valves
had three hydraulic connections to carry out
these functions. The disadvantages of this
valve design were extremely expensive electri-
cal control and great mechanical complexity.
Control with the 2/2 valves of the current
generations offers a less expensive solution.
The following section describes how these
valves work.

Generation 8, which was introduced onto

the market in 2001, is designed as a fully
modular system. The hydraulic system can
therefore be tailored to meet the require-
ments of the respective vehicle manufacturer
such as with regard to value added functions,
comfort and convenience, vehicle segment
(up to lightweight commercial vehicles), etc.
Generation 8 is immersion-proof which
means that the hydraulic modulator can
withstand brief immersion in water.

greater slip determines the controllable pres-
sure of the axle.

With a 4-channel ABS system (for dual 
or X-braking-force distribution), one inlet
and one outlet valve is used for each wheel re-
sulting in a total of eight valves. This system
allows each wheel to be controlled individu-
ally.

Moreover, the system features one pump ele-
ment (return pump) and one low-pressure
reservoir for each brake circuit. Both pump 
elements are operated by a shared DC motor.

Design

Mechanical system
A hydraulic modulator for ABS/TCS/ESP
consists of an aluminum block into which the
hydraulic layout is drilled (Fig. 2). This block
also houses the necessary hydraulic function
elements (Fig. 1) presented below. 

ABS hydraulic modulator
With a 3-channel ABS system, this block fea-
tures one inlet valve and one outlet valve for
each front wheel and one inlet valve and one
outlet valve for the rear axle – a total of six
valves. This system can only be used in vehi-
cles featuring a dual brake-circuit configura-
tion. The two wheels at the rear axle are not
controlled individually, rather both wheels
are controlled according to the select-low
principle. This means that the wheel with the

Hydraulic modulator

Design

TCS hydraulic modulator
Unlike an ABS unit, a TCS system with 
II-brake-circuit configuration also has a
switchover valve and an inlet valve at the 
rear axle (driven wheels) resulting in a total 
of 10 valves.

In TCS systems with X-brake-circuit con-
figuration an additional switchover valve and
inlet valve are required for each circuit (a to-
tal of 12 valves).

ESP hydraulic modulator
ESP systems require 12 valves irrespective of
the brake-circuit configuration (Fig. 3). In
these systems, the two inlet valves, as used in
the TCS hydraulic modulator, are replaced by
two high-pressure switching valves. The dif-
ference between the two types of valves is 
that the high-pressure switching valve can
switch against higher differential pressures 
(> 0.1 MPa). With ESP it may be necessary to
increase the brake pressure specified by the

driver in order to stabilize the vehicle. During
such a maneuver (partially-active maneuver),
the suction path of the pump must be opened
despite the high primary pressure.

An integrated pressure sensor is used exclu-

sively in ESP systems. The sensor detects the
brake pressure in the master cylinder i.e. the
driver command. This is also required for a
partially-active ESP control maneuver since it
is important to know the primary pressure
applied by the driver pressing the brake pedal.

Since TCS/ESP systems are required to
 generate pressure automatically, the return
pump is replaced by a self-priming pump 
in both these systems. An additional non-
 return valve with a specific closing pressure is
required to prevent the pump from drawing
unwanted media from the wheels.

Evolution of the ABS system
Technological advances in the areas of 
(cid:1) solenoid-valve design and manufacturing,
(cid:1) assembly and component integration,
(cid:1) electronic circuitry (discrete components
replaced by hybrid and integrated circuits
with microcontrollers),

(cid:1) testing methods and equipment (separate
testing of electronic and hydraulic systems
before combination in the hydraulic modula-
tor), and

(cid:1) sensor and relay technology

have enabled the weight and dimensions of
ABS systems to be more than halved since
the first-generation ABS2 in 1978. As a re-
sult, modern systems can now be accom-
modated even in vehicles with the tightest
space restrictions. Those advances have
also lowered the cost of ABS systems to
the extent that it has now become standard
equipment on all types of vehicle.

Hydraulic modulator

Pressure modulation

Pressure modulation

Modulation with ABS control
The pressure of an ABS/TCS/ESP system 
is modulated using solenoid valves. The out-
let valves and the inlet and high-pressure
switching valves (for TCS and ESP systems)
are switching valves that are closed at zero
current and can adopt two positions – closed
or open. 

In contrast, the inlet valves and switchover
valves are both open at zero current and are
used as control valves for the first time in
generation 8. This is advantageous not only
for instantaneous braking power and braking
comfort but also for noise emissions. Pres-
sures of up to 200 bar can be modulated us-
ing the standard valve set. Special systems for
even higher pressures and also for greater
throughput, usually required in the commer-
cial vehicle sector, can be designed based on
further developments of the generation 8
modular system. 

All valves are controlled using coils which
are controlled via the add-on control unit. 

Pressure modulation with ABS hydraulic
modulator
In the event of ABS brake application, the
driver first generates the brake pressure at 
the wheel by pressing the brake pedal. This
can be done without switching the valves
since the inlet valve is open at zero current
and the outlet valve is closed at zero current
(Fig. 1a).

The pressure maintenance state is generated

when the inlet valve is closed (Fig. 1b).

If a wheel locks up, the pressure from this

wheel is released by opening the relevant 
outlet valve (Fig. 1c). The brake fluid can 
also escape from the wheel-brake cylinder 
to the relevant low-pressure reservoir. 
This chamber performs the role of a buffer. 
It can receive the brake fluid quickly and
 efficiently. The return pump in the circuit,
which is driven by a shared motor via an
 eccentric element, reduces the pressure speci-
fied by the driver. The motor is actuated
based on demand i.e. the motor is actuated

according to the rotational speed. The ABS
system can of course control several wheels 
if they lock up simultaneously.

switching valve that is closed at zero current.
These two valves are required for active/par-
tially-active brake intervention (Fig. 2). 

Pressure generation with ESP
The pressure generation chain consists 
of two self-priming pumps and a motor.
Plunger pumps are used, as for ABS, but these
pumps can generate pressure without requir-
ing the primary pressure applied when the
driver presses the brake pedal. These pumps
are driven by a DC motor based on demand.
The motor drives an eccentric bearing located
on the shaft of the motor.

TCS/ESP pumps can build up pressure inde-
pendently of the driver or increase the brak-
ing pressure already generated by the driver.
These systems are therefore able to initiate
brake application. To do this, the switchover
valve is closed and the inlet valve or high-
pressure switching valve is opened. Fluid 
can then be drawn from the brake fluid 
reservoir via the master cylinder and pressure
can be built up in the wheel-brake cylinders
(Fig. 2c). This is required not only for
TCS/ESP functions, but also for many addi-
tional convenience functions (value added
functions such as the brake assist (HBA)).

Demand-based control of the pump motor
reduces noise emission during pressure gen-
eration and regulation. The pumps can be
equipped with damping elements to satisfy
vehicle manufacturer’s strict low noise emis-
sion requirements. 

Pressure modulation with ESP hydraulic
modulators
Pressure is modulated with ESP control  using
ESP hydraulics in the same way as described
for ABS. Unlike with ABS, however, the
wheel-brake cylinder and master cylinder are
also connected via a switchover valve that is
open at zero current and a high-pressure

Pressure modulation

Fully-active control
If the ESP controller detects an unstable
 vehicle state, the switchover valves are closed.
This prevents the pumps from being hy-
draulically short-circuited via the switchover/
high-pressure switching valve which would
prevent pressure generation. The high-pres-
sure switching valves are  simultaneously
opened. The self-priming pump now pumps
brake fluid to the relevant wheel or wheels in
order to build up pressure. If pressure genera-
tion is only required in one wheel, (for yaw
rate compensation), the inlet valves of the
other wheels are closed. To reduce the pres-
sure, the outlet valves are opened and the
high-pressure switching valves and switch-
over valves return to their original position.
The brake fluid flows from the wheels to 
the reservoirs. The pumps then empty the
reservoirs. 

With ESP, there are basically three different
applications: 
(cid:1) Passive – as previously described for ABS

control.

(cid:1) Partially-active – when the pressure speci-
fied by the driver is insufficient to stabilize
the vehicle.

(cid:1) Fully-active – when pressure is generated 
to stabilize the vehicle without the driver
pressing the brake pedal.

Both pressure generation cases above, in ad-
dition to ESP control, are used for a whole se-
ries of additional functions such as adaptive
cruise control and the brake assist.

Partially-active control
For partially-active control, the high-pressure
switching valve must be able to open the suc-
tion path of the pump against high pressures.
This is required since the driver has already
generated a high pressure, but this pressure is
insufficient to stabilize the vehicle.

The high-pressure switching valve is

 designed with two stages so that the valve can
open against the high pressure. The first stage
of the valve is opened via the magnetic force
of the energized coil; the second stage via the
hydraulic area difference.

If the ESP controller detects an unstable 
vehicle state, the switchover valves (open at
zero current) are closed and the high-pres-
sure switching valve (closed at zero current) 
is opened. The two pumps then generate
 additional pressure in order to stabilize the
vehicle.

Once the vehicle is stabilized, the outlet
valve is opened and the excess pressure in the
controlled wheel escapes to the reservoir. As
soon as the driver releases the brake pedal, the
fluid is pumped from the reservoir back to
the brake fluid reservoir.

Development of hydraulic modulators

Control of hydraulic modulators
An electronic control unit processes the infor-
mation received from the sensors and gener-
ates the control signals for the hydraulic mod-
ulator. The hydraulic modulator incorporates 
a series of solenoid valves that can open or
close the hydraulic circuits between the mas-
ter cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinders.

Hydraulic modulators with 3/3 solenoid valves
In 1978 version ABS2S was the first antilock
braking system to go into series production. 
In this ABS system the electronic control unit
switches the 3/3 solenoid valves of the hy-
draulic modulator to three different valve posi-
tions. There is a solenoid valve for each wheel-
brake cylinder (Fig. 1a).
– The first (zero-current) position connects
the master cylinder and the wheel-brake
cylinder; the wheel brake pressure can rise.

– The second position (excitation at half the
maximum current) separates the wheel
brake from the master cylinder and return
line so that the wheel brake pressure
 remains constant.

– The third position (excitation at the maxi-

mum current) separates the master cylinder
and simultaneously connects the wheel
brake and return line so that the wheel
brake pressure decreases. 

By applying these settings in the appropriate
sequences, the brake pressure can thus be

1

Comparison of ABS systems

 increased and reduced either continuously or
incrementally (and therefore gradually).

Hydraulic modulators with 2/2 solenoid valves
While version ABS2S operates with 3/3 sole-
noid valves, the successor systems ABS5 and
ABS8 feature 2/2 solenoid valves with two hy-
draulic connections and two valve positions.
The inlet valve between the master cylinder and
the wheel-brake cylinder controls pressure
build-up, while the outlet valve between the
wheel-brake cylinder and the return pump con-
trols pressure release. There is a solenoid valve
pair for each wheel-brake cylinder (Fig. 1b).
– In the “pressure build-up” position, the inlet
valve connects the master cylinder to the
wheel-brake cylinder so that the brake pres-
sure built up in the master cylinder can be
applied to the wheel-brake cylinder when
the brakes are applied.

– In the “pressure maintenance” position, the
inlet valve blocks the connection between
the master cylinder and wheel-brake cylin-
der during rapid wheel deceleration (risk 
of locking up) and thus prevents the brake
pressure from rising any higher. The outlet
valve is also closed.

– If the wheel deceleration continues to in-

crease, the inlet valve continues to block in
the “decrease pressure” position. In addition
the return pump pumps out the brake fluid
via the open outlet valve so that the brake
pressure in the wheel-brake cylinder drops.

Sensors for Brake Control

Automotive applications

Sensors for Brake Control

Sensors register operating states (e. g.  engine
speed) and setpoint/desired values (e. g. ac-
celerator-pedal position). They  convert phys-
ical quantities (e. g. pressure) or chemical
quantities (e. g. exhaust-gas concentration)
into electric signals.

Automotive applications

Sensors and actuators represent the interfaces
between the ECU’s, as the processing units,
and the vehicle with its complex drive, brak-
ing, chassis, and bodywork functions (for 
instance, the engine management, the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP), and the air
conditioner). As a rule, a matching circuit in
the sensor converts the signals so that they
can be processed by the ECU.

The field of mechatronics, where mechanical,
electronic and data-processing components
operate closely together, is also becoming in-
creasingly important for sensors. Sensors are
integrated in modules (e.g. in the crankshaft
CSWS (Composite Seal with Sensor) module
complete with rpm sensor). 

Sensors are becoming smaller and smaller. 
At the same time they are also required to 
become faster and more precise since their
output signals directly affect not only the en-
gine’s power output, torque, and emissions,
but also vehicle handling and safety. These
stipulations can be complied with thanks to
mechatronics.

Depending upon the level of integration, sig-
nal conditioning, analog/digital conversion,
and self-calibration functions can all be inte-
grated in the sensor (Fig. 1), and in future a
small microcomputer for further signal pro-
cessing will be added. The advantages are as
follows:
(cid:0) less computing power is required by the

electronic control unit,

(cid:0) one uniform, flexible and bus-compatible

interface for all sensors,

(cid:0) direct multi-purpose use of a sensor via the

data bus,

(cid:0) smaller effects can be measured, and 
(cid:0) easy sensor calibration.

Despite the assistance provided by electronic control systems, 
the latest generation of passenger car chassis still relies heavily on 
conventional chassis elements. This book examines these conven-
tional elements and their interactions with mechatronic systems 
within the context of driving dynamics. Chassis fundamentals and 
design are described in the initial chapters, followed by a practical 
examination of driving dynamics and detailed descriptions and 
explanations of modern chassis components. A separate section is 
devoted to axles and the processes used during axle development. 
This fi rst English edition features a number of improvements over 
the latest German edition, including revised illustrations and several

Sensors for Brake Control Wheel-speed sensors

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors
A passive (inductive) speed sensor consists of
a permanent magnet (Fig. 2, 1) with a soft-
magnetic pole pin (3) connected to it, which
is inserted into a coil (2) with several thou-
sand windings. This setup generates a con-
stant magnetic field.

The pole pin is installed directly above 
the pulse wheel (4), a gear wheel attached to
the wheel hub. As the pulse wheel turns, the
continuously alternating sequence of teeth
and gaps induces corresponding fluctuations
in the constant magnetic field. This changes
the magnetic flux through the pole pin and
therefore also through the coil winding.
These fluctuations induce an alternating cur-
rent in the coil suitable for monitoring at the
ends of its winding. 

The frequency and amplitude of this alter-

nating current are proportional to wheel
speed (Fig. 3) and when the wheel is not
 rotating, the induced voltage is zero.

Tooth shape, air gap, rate of voltage rise,

and the ECU input sensitivity define the
smallest still measurable vehicle speed and
thus, for ABS applications, the minimum
 response sensitivity and switching speed. 

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors

Wheel-speed sensors

Application
Wheel-speed sensors are used to measure the
rotational speed of the vehicle wheels (wheel
speed). The speed signals are transmitted via
cables to the ABS, TCS or ESP control unit of
the vehicle which controls the braking force
individually at each wheel. This control loop
prevents the wheels from locking up (with
ABS) or from spinning (with TCS or ESP) so
that the vehicle’s  stability and steerability are
maintained.

Navigation systems also use the wheel

speed signals to calculate the distance traveled
(e. g. in tunnels or if satellite signals are un-
available).

Design and method of operation
The signals for the wheel-speed sensor are
generated by a steel pulse generator that is
fixed to the wheel hub (for passive sensors) 
or by a multipole magnetic pulse generator
(for active sensors). This pulse generator has
the same rotational speed as the wheel and
moves past the sensitive area of the sensor
head without touching it. The sensor “reads”
without direct contact via an air gap of up to
2 mm (Fig. 2).

The air gap (with strict tolerances) ensures

interference-free signal acquisition. Possible
interference caused for instance by oscillation
patterns in the vicinity of the brakes, vibra-
tions, temperature, moisture, installation
conditions at the wheel, etc. is therefore 
eliminated.

Since 1998 active wheel-speed sensors have
been used almost exclusively with new devel-
opments instead of passive (inductive) wheel-
speed sensors.

Various pole-pin configurations and installa-
tion options are available to adapt the system
to the different installation conditions en-
countered with various wheels. The most
common variants are the chisel-type pole pin
(Fig. 1a, also called a flat pole pin) and the
rhombus-type pole pin (Fig. 1b, also called a
lozenge-shaped pole pin). Both pole-pin de-
signs necessitate precise alignment to the
pulse wheel during installation. 

Active wheel-speed sensors
Sensor elements
Active wheel-speed sensors are used almost
exclusively in today’s modern brake systems
(Fig. 4). These sensors usually consist of a
hermetic, plastic-cast silicon IC that sits in
the sensor head. 

In addition to magnetoresistive ICs (the
electrical resistance changes as the magnetic
field changes) Bosch now uses Hall sensor el-
ements almost exclusively. These sensors react
to the smallest changes in the magnetic field
and therefore allow greater air gaps compared
to passive wheel-speed sensors.

Sensors for Brake Control Wheel-speed sensors

Pulse wheels
A multipole ring is used as a pulse wheel for
active wheel-speed sensors. The multipole
ring consists of alternately magnetized plastic
elements that are arranged in the shape of a
ring on a nonmagnetic metal carrier (Fig. 6
and Fig. 7a). These north and south poles
adopt the function formerly performed by
the teeth of the pulse wheel. 
The IC of the sensor is located in the continu-
ously changing fields generated by these mag-
nets (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7a). The magnetic flux
through the IC therefore changes continu-
ously as the multipole ring turns.

A steel pulse wheel can also be used instead 
of the multipole ring. In this case a magnet 
is mounted on the Hall IC that generates 
a constant magnetic field (Fig. 7b). As the
pulse wheel turns, the continuously alter -
nating sequence of teeth and gaps induces
corresponding fluctuations in the constant
magnetic field. The measuring principle,
 signal processing and IC are otherwise
 identical to the sensor without a magnet.

Characteristics
A typical feature of the active wheel-speed
sensor is the integration of a Hall measuring
element, signal amplifier and signal condi-
tioning in an IC (Fig. 8). The wheel-speed
data is transferred as an impressed current 
in the form of square-wave pulses (Fig. 9).
The frequency of the pulses is proportional 
to the wheel speed and the speed can be
 detected until the wheel is practically
 stationary (0.1 km/h).

The supply voltage is between 4.5 and
20 volts. The square-wave output signal level
is 7 mA (low) and 14 mA (high).

This type of data-transmission using digital
signals is less sensitive to interference than the
signals from passive inductive sensors. The
sensor is connected to the ECU by a two-
conductor wire.

Compact dimensions combine with low
weight to make the active wheel-speed  sensor
suitable for installation on and even within
the vehicle’s wheel-bearing assemblies (Fig.
10). Various standard sensor head shapes are
suitable for this.

Digital signal conditioning makes it possible
to transfer coded additional information us-
ing a pulse-width-modulated output signal
(Fig. 11):  
(cid:0) Direction of wheel rotation recognition:
This is especially significant for the “hill
hold control” feature, which relies on selec-
tive braking to prevent the vehicle from
rolling backwards when starting off on a
hill. The direction of rotation recognition
is also used in vehicle navigation systems. 

(cid:0) Standstill recognition: 

This information can also be evaluated 
by the “hill hold control” function. The in-
formation is also used for self-diagnosis.

(cid:0) Signal quality of the sensor: 

Information about the signal quality of the
sensor can be relayed in the signal. 
If a fault occurs the driver can be advised
that service is required.

Sensors for Brake Control

Hall-effect acceleration sensors

Hall-effect acceleration
 sensors

Applications
Vehicles equipped with the Antilock Braking
System ABS, the Traction Control System
TCS, all-wheel drive, and/or Electronic Stabil-
ity Program ESP, also have a Hall-effect accel-
eration sensor in addition to the wheel-speed
sensors. This measures the vehicle’s longitudi-
nal and transverse accelerations (depending
upon installation position  referred to the 
direction of travel). 

1

Hall-effect acceleration sensor (opened)

Design and construction
A resiliently mounted spring-mass system is
used in the Hall-effect acceleration sensors
(Figs. 1 and 2).

It comprises an edgewise-mounted strip
spring (3) tightly clamped at one end. At-
tached to its other end is a permanent magnet
(2) which acts as the seismic mass. The actual
Hall-effect sensor (1) is located above the
permanent magnet together with the evalua-
tion electronics. There is a small  copper
damping plate (4) underneath the magnet.

Operating concept
When the sensor is subjected to acceleration
which is lateral to the spring, the spring-mass
system changes its neutral position accord-
ingly. Its deflection is a measure for the accel-
eration. The magnetic flux F from the mov-
ing magnet generates a Hall voltage UH in the
Hall-effect sensor. The output voltage UA
from the evaluation circuit is derived from
this Hall voltage and climbs linearly along
with acceleration (Fig. 3, measuring range 
approx. 1 g). 

This sensor is designed for a narrow band-
width of several Hz and is electrodynamically
damped.

Sensors for Brake Control

Micromechanical yaw-rate sensors

Micromechanical yaw-rate
sensors

Applications
In vehicles with Electronic Stability Program
(ESP), the rotation of the vehicle about its
vertical axis is registered by micromechanical
yaw-rate (or yaw-speed) sensors (also known
as gyrometers) and applied for vehicle-dy-
namics control. This takes place during nor-
mal cornering, but also when the  vehicle
breaks away or goes into a skid.

These sensors are reasonably priced as 
well as being very compact. They are in the
process of forcing out the conventional high-
precision mechanical sensors.

Structure of the MM1 yaw-rate sensor

200   m

Design and construction
MM1 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
A mixed form of technology is applied in
 order to achieve the high accuracies needed
for vehicle-dynamics systems. That is, two
somewhat thicker oscillating elements (mass
plates) which have been machined from a
wafer using bulk micromechanics oscillate in
counter-phase to their resonant frequency
which is defined by their mass and their cou-
pling springs (>2 kHz). On each of these 
oscillating elements, there is a miniature, 
surface-type micromechanical capacitive
 acceleration sensor. When the sensor chip 
rotates about its vertical axis at yaw rate Ω,
these register the Coriolis acceleration in the
wafer plane vertical to the direction of oscilla-
tion (Figs. 1 and 2). These accelerations are
proportional to the product of yaw  rate and
and the oscillatory velocity which is main-
tained electronically at a constant value. 

To drive the sensor, all that is required is a
simple, current-carrying printed conductor
on each oscillating element. In the perma-
nent-magnet field B vertical to the chip sur-
face, this oscillating element is subjected to an
electrodynamic (Lorentz) force. Using a fur-
ther, simple printed conductor (which saves
on chip surface), the same magnetic field is
used to directly measure the oscillation veloc-
ity by inductive means. The different physical
construction of drive system and sensor sys-

avoid excessive damping of this movement,
the sensor must be operated in a vacuum. 
Although the chip’s small size and the some-
what simpler production process  result in
considerable cost reductions, this miniaturi-
sation is at the expense of reductions in the
measuring effect, which in any case is not
very pronounced, and therefore of the achiev-
able precision. It also places more severe de-
mands on the electronics. The system’s high
flexural stability, and mounting in the axis of
gravity, serve to mechanically suppress the ef-
fects of unwanted acceleration from the side.

tem serves to avoid undesirable coupling be-
tween the two sections. In order to suppress
unwanted external acceleration effects, the
opposing sensor signals are subtracted from
each other. The external acceleration effects
can be measured by applying summation.
The high-precision micromechanical con-
struction helps to suppress the effects of high
oscillatory acceleration which is several fac-
tors of 10 higher than the low-level Coriolis
acceleration (cross sensitivity far below 
40 dB). Here, the drive and measurement 
systems are rigorously decoupled from each
other. 

MM2 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
Whereas this silicon yaw-rate sensor is pro-
duced completely using surface-microme-
chanic techniques, and the magnetic drive
and control system have been superseded by
an electrostatic system, absolute decoupling
of the power/drive system and measuring 
system is impossible. Comb-like structures
(Figs. 3 and 4) electrostatically force a cen-
trally mounted rotary oscillator to oscillate.
The amplitude of these oscillations is held
constant by means of a similar capacitive
pick-off. Coriolis forces result at the same
time in an out-of-plane tilting movement, the
amplitude of which is proportional to the yaw
rate Ω, and which is detected capacitively by
the electrodes underneath the  oscillator. To

Sensors for Brake Control

Steering-wheel-angle sensors

Steering-wheel-angle  sensors

Application
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) ap-
plies the brakes selectively to the individual
wheels in order to keep the vehicle on the
 desired track selected by the driver. Here, the
steering-wheel angle and the applied braking
pressure are compared with the vehicle’s ac-
tual rotary motion (around its vertical axis)
and its road speed. If necessary, the brakes are
applied at individual wheels. These measures
serve to keep the float angle (deviation be-
tween the vehicle axis and the actual vehicle
movement) down to a minimum and, until
the physical limits are reached, prevent the
vehicle breaking away. 

Basically speaking, practically all types of
angle-of-rotation sensors are suitable for reg-
istering the steering-wheel angle. Safety con-
siderations, though, dictate that only those
types are used which can be easily checked for
plausibility, or which in the ideal case auto-
matically check themselves. Potentiometer
principles are used, as well as optical code-
registration and magnetic principles. Whereas
a passenger-car steering wheel turns through
±720° (a total of 4 complete turns), conven-
tional angle-of-rotation sensors can only
measure maximum 360°. This means that
with the majority of the sensors actually used
for this purpose it is necessary to continually
register and store the data on the steering
wheel’s actual setting. 

Design and operating concept
There are two absolute-measuring (in con-
trast to incremental-measuring) magnetic 
angle-of-rotation sensors available which are
matched to the Bosch ECUs. At any instant in
time, these sensors can output the steering-
wheel angle throughout the complete angular
range. 

Hall-effect steering-wheel-angle sensor
(LWS1)
The LWS1 uses 14 Hall-effect vane switches 
to register the angle and the rotations of the
steering wheel. The Hall-effect vane switch is

similar in operation to a light barrier. A Hall-
effect element measures the magnetic field of
an adjacent magnet. A magnetic code disc ro-
tates with the steering shaft and strongly re-
duces the magnet’s field or screens it off com-
pletely. In this manner, with nine Hall ICs it is
possible to obtain the steering wheel’s angular
position in digital form. The remaining five
Hall-effect sensors register the particular
steering-wheel revolution which is trans-
formed to the final 360° range by 4:1 step-
down gearing. 

The first item from the top in the exploded
view of the LWS 1 steering-wheel-angle sensor
(Fig. 1) shows the nine permanent magnets.
These are screened individually by the magneti-
cally-soft code disc beneath them when this ro-
tates along with the steering shaft, and depend-
ing upon steering-wheel movement. The pcb
immediately  below the code disc contains Hall-
effect switches (IC), and a microprocessor in

which plausibility tests are performed and in-
formation on angular position decoded and
conditioned ready for the CAN-Bus. The 
bottom half of the assembly contains the step-
down gearing and the remaining five Hall-
effect vane switches.

The LWS1 was superseded by the LWS3
due to the large number of sensor elements
required, together with the necessity for the
magnets to be aligned with the Hall-IC.

Magnetoresistive steering-wheel-angle  sensor
LWS3
The LWS 3 also depends upon AMR (aniso -
tropic magnetoresistive sensors) for its opera-
tion. The AMR’s electrical resistance changes
according to the direction of an external mag-
netic field. In the LWS3, the information on
angle across a range of four complete rota-
tions is provided by measuring the angles of
two gearwheels which are rotated by a third
gearwheel on the steering-column shaft. The
first two gearwheels differ by one tooth which
means that a definite pair of  angular variables
is associated with every possible steering-
wheel position. 

By applying a mathematical algorithm (a
computing process which follows a defined
step-by-step procedure) referred to here as a
modified vernier principle, it is possible to
use the above AMR method for calculating
the steering-wheel angle in a microcomputer.
Here, even the measuring inaccuracy of the
two AMR sensors can be compensated for. 
In addition, a self-check can also be imple-
mented so that a highly plausible measured
value can be sent to the ECU. 

Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation 
of the LWS3 steering-wheel-angle sensor. The
two gearwheels, with magnets inserted, can 
be seen. The sensors are located above them
togther with the evaluation electronics. With
this design too, price pressure forces the devel-
opment engineers to look for innovative sens-
ing concepts. In this respect, investigation is
proceeding on whether, since it only measures
up to 360°, a single AMR angle-of-rotation sen-
sor (LWS4) on the end of the steering shaft
would be accurate enough for ESP (Fig. 4).

Sensotronic brake control

Purpose and function

Sensotronic brake control (SBC)

Sensotronic brake control (SBC) is an
 electrohydraulic brake system that com-
bines the functions of a brake servo unit
and the ABS (antilock braking system)
equipment, including ESP (electronic
 stability program). The mechanical opera-
tion of the brake pedal is redundantly mea-
sured by the actuator unit and transmitted
to the control unit. There, control com-
mands are calculated according to specific
algorithms and passed to the hydraulic
modulator where they are converted into
pressure modulating operations for the
brakes. If the electronics fail, a hydraulic
fallback system is automatically available.

Purpose and function

By utilizing its “brake-by-wire” capabilities,
SBC can control the hydraulic pressure in
the wheel brake cylinders independently of
driver input. As a result, functions beyond
those performed by ABS (antilock braking
system), TCS (traction control system) and
ESP (electronic stability program) can be
implemented. One example is the conve-
nient method of brake application for ACC
(adaptive cruise control).

1

SBC components in the car

Basic functions
As with a conventional braking system,
 sensotronic brake control must be capable of 
(cid:0) reducing the speed of the vehicle, 
(cid:0) bringing the vehicle to a halt, and
(cid:0) keeping the vehicle stationary when it is

stopped.

As an active braking system, it also performs
the tasks of 
(cid:0) operating the brakes, 
(cid:0) amplifying the brake force, and 
(cid:0) modulating the brake force. 

SBC is an electronic control system with
 hydraulic actuators. Braking force distribu-
tion takes place electronically to each wheel
in response to driving conditions. A vacuum
source for the brake servo function is no
longer required. The self-diagnosis capabil-
ity enables an early warning function for
 detection of possible system faults.

SBC uses hydraulic standard wheel

brakes. Because of the fully electronic pres-
sure control, SBC can be easily networked
with vehicle handling systems. It thus meets
all the demands made of future braking
 systems.

Sensotronic brake control

Purpose and function

155

By using a high-pressure accumulator, SBC
is capable of extremely rapid dynamic pres-
sure increases and thus offers the potential
for achieving short braking distances and
excellent vehicle handling stability. Brake
pressure modulation and active braking are
silent and produce no brake pedal feedback.
Consequently, SBC also satisfies demands
for greater levels of comfort.

Braking characteristics can be adapted to
the driving conditions (e.g. sharper response
at high speeds or with more dynamic dri-
ving styles). “Duller” pedal characteristics
 allow the reduction of the braking effect,
which is necessitated by physics, to be
 signaled to the driver before fading due
to overheating occurs.

Additional SBC functions
The auxiliary functions provided by SBC
make a significant extra contribution to
safety and convenience.

Hill hold control
After hill hold control is activated by a sig-
nificant increase in brake pressure while the
 vehicle is stationary, the vehicle remains
braked without the need to keep the pedal
down. The hill hold control is automatically
released as soon as the driver has built up
sufficient engine torque by depressing the
accelerator. This allows the driver to start the
car on a hill, for example, without activating
the parking brake system. Likewise, in other
situations in which the vehicle would roll
out of position if not braked, the driver does
not need to keep his or her foot on the brake
at all times once hill hold control has been
 activated.

Enhanced brake assist function
If the driver abruptly releases the accelerator,
an automatically regulated brake pressure
build-up takes place that gently applies the
brake pads. If panic braking follows, this al-
lows the brake to “grab” more quickly and
thus allows a shorter total braking distance. 
If the system detects panic braking, the
brake pressure is briefly increased until the

optimum friction value is fully utilized. This
results in a significant reduction of total
braking distance for hesitant drivers. The
highly dynamic braking force build-up of
SBC exceeds that of conventional systems in
this regard.

Soft stop assist
SBC provides comfortable braking that stops
the car with no jerking by automatically
 reducing the pressure just before the car
comes to a complete stop. If more decelera-
tion is desired, this function is not activated
and SBC minimizes the braking distance. 

Traffic jam assist
When traffic jam assist is activated, SBC
builds up a higher drag torque, which means
that the driver does not have to constantly
alternate between the accelerator and brake.
The vehicle is automatically braked and, if
necessary, brought to a complete stop and
kept at a complete stop. This function can be
activated at speeds of 50 - 60 km/h.

Brake wiping
“Brake wiping” is an operation whereby 
the film of water is regularly removed from
the brake disks in wet weather. It results in
shorter stopping distances in wet conditions.
You can take the information for activating
this function from the windshield wiper
 signal, for example.

Sensotronic brake control

Design, method of operation

Design

The sensotronic brake control system
 consists of the following components:
(cid:0) Actuator unit (Fig. 1, Item 6)
(cid:0) Vehicle dynamics sensors (1, 4 and 7)
(cid:0) Discrete (separate) ECU (3)
(cid:0) Hydraulic modulator with add-on

ECU (5).

Those components are interconnected by
electrical control leads and hydraulic pipes.
Fig. 1 shows where they are fitted in a car. 

Actuator unit
The actuator unit consists of: 
(cid:0) Master cylinder with expansion tank,
(cid:0) Pedal travel simulator and
(cid:0) Pedal travel sensor.

Pedal travel simulation
The pedal travel simulator makes it possible
to realize a suitable force-distance curve and
an appropriate damping of the brake pedal.
In that way, the driver obtains the same
“brake feel” with the sensotronic brake
 control system as with a very well designed
conventional braking system.

Sensors of the SBC systems
The SBC sensors consist of the vehicle
 dynamics sensors familiar from ESP and
the actual SBC sensors.

Vehicle dynamics sensors
The ESP sensors consist of four wheel speed
sensors, the yaw rate sensor, a steering angle
sensor and, where applicable, a lateral accel-
eration sensor. These sensors provide the
ECU with data relating to the speed and
movement status of the wheels and driving
states such as cornering. Control functions
such as ABS, TCS and ESP are executed in
the familiar manner.

If the vehicle is fitted with ACC (adaptive
cruise control), a radar system measures the
distance to the vehicle in front. From these
data, the SBC control unit calculates the

brake pressure to be applied, which is built
up without pedal feedback.

SBC sensors
Four pressure sensors measure the pressure
individually for each wheel circuit (Fig. 3).
A pressure sensor measures the storage pres-
sure of the high-pressure accumulator. The
driver’s braking request is calculated by the
pedal travel sensor attached to the  actuator
unit and a pressure sensor that  detects the
brake pressure applied by the  driver. 

The pedal travel sensor consists of two

 redundant, independent angle sensors.
 Together with the pressure sensor for the
 driver’s brake pressure, they allow a threefold
detection of the driver’s request, and the sys-
tem can continue to work without errors
even if one of these systems fails.

Method of operation

Normal operation
Fig. 3 illustrates the components of SBC in
the form of a block diagram. An electric 
motor drives a hydraulic pump. This charges
a high-pressure accumulator to a pressure
between approx. 90 and 130 bar, which is
monitored by the accumulator pressure sen-
sor. The four independent wheel pressure
modulators are supplied by this accumulator
and adjust the required pressure individually
for each wheel. The pressure modulators
themselves each consist of two valves with
proportional control characteristics and a
pressure sensor. 

In normal operation, the isolating valves

interrupt the connection to the actuator.
The system is in “brake-by-wire” mode. It
electronically detects the driver’s braking re-
quest and transmits it “by wire” to the wheel
pressure modulators. The interaction of the
engine, valves and pressure sensors is con-
trolled by the electronics, which are installed
in the add-on ECU in hybrid technology.
They have two microcontrollers that moni-
tor each other. The essential feature of these
electronics is their extensive self-diagnosis,

Sensotronic brake control

Method of operation

157

which monitors the plausibility of every sys-
tem state at all times. In this way, the driver
can be notified of any failures before critical
states occur. If components fail, the system
automatically provides the optimal remain-
ing partial function to the driver. An exten-
sive fault memory allows prompt diagnostics
and repair in the event of a fault.

An intelligent interface with CAN bus es-
tablishes the connection to the discrete ECU.
The following functions are integrated there:
(cid:0) ESP (electronic stability program), 
(cid:0) TCS (traction control system),
(cid:0) ABS (antilock braking system),
(cid:0) Driver brake request calculation and
(cid:0) SBC auxiliary functions (assist functions).

Braking in the event of system failure
For safety reasons, the SBC system is de-
signed so that in the event of any serious 
errors (such as failure of the power supply),
the system is switched to a state in which the
vehicle can be braked even without active
brake force support. When de-energized, the
isolating valves establish a direct connection
to the actuator (Fig. 3) and thus allow a direct
hydraulic connection from the actuator unit
to the wheel brake cylinders. 

To maintain optimum function even if
the system fails, the plunger pistons in the 
illustration serve as a medium separator be-
tween the active circuit of the SBC and the
conventional front axle brake circuit. These
prevent any gas that might escape from the
high-pressure accumulator from reaching
the brake circuit of the front wheels, which
would diminish the instantaneous braking
power in the event of a system failure.

Active steering

Purpose, design

Active steering

The development of vehicle steering sys-
tems is characterized by the consistent
 introduction of hydraulic servo assist and
the replacement of ball-and-nut-type steer-
ing in the car by the easier and more inex-
pensive rack-and-pinion steering. Recently,
electromechanical power steering has been
displacing hydraulic power steering in small
and lightweight cars. By law, however, pure
“steer-by-wire” technology is not yet per-
mitted in motor vehicles. European Union
safety regulations still require a mechanical
connection between the steering wheel and
the wheels of the vehicle.

All of these developments have the goal of
making vehicle handling as easy as possible
and to limit steering forces to a logical
amount. The best possible feedback about
the contact of the tires to the road is to be
ensured. This has a decisive impact on the
driver’s ability to manage his or her task in
the control loop between driver, vehicle and
environment.

Purpose

The newly developed active steering can
 affect the steering forces and the steering
 angle set by the driver. It fulfills the wish for
a direct steering ratio to improve handling at
low speeds. It also meets requirements for
ensuring comfort, drivability and straight-
running stability at high speeds. Active steer-
ing is an initial step towards a “steer-by-
wire” function. Although it does not let the
car drive itself, it provides correction func-
tions and added comfort and convenience.

Design

The primary difference between active steer-
ing and a “steer-by-wire” system is the fact
that the steering train, and thus the driver’s
mechanical control of the steered front
wheels, is maintained during active steering.

Active steering

Purpose, design

159

Mechanical system
The steering train consists, as usual, of the
steering wheel, steering column, steering
gear and tie rods. The special feature of the
new active steering is a differential gearbox
(Fig. 2). For this purpose, a planetary gear
(6) is integrated with two input shafts and
one output shaft in the steering gear. One
input shaft is connected to the steering
wheel, and the other drives an electric motor
(4) via a worm gear pair (3) as a reduction
stage. The connected ECU processes the
necessary sensor signals, controls the electric
motor and monitors the entire steering
 system. 

The electric motor and differential gearbox
allow steering intervention at the front axle
to take place independently of the driver. 
At low speeds, the effective steering angle 
at the wheels is greater than the angle set
on the steering wheel, as the system adds a
part that is proportional to the steering 
angle. At high speeds, it subtracts a corre-
sponding amount so that the wheel angle is

smaller than that set by the driver (Fig. 1).
When the electric motor is inactive, the
steering wheel controls the vehicle’s wheels
directly, as with conventional steering
 systems.

Hydraulic system
The principle of differential steering usually
requires a hydraulic servo assist to limit the
forces applied by hand to a logical amount.
This is accomplished using an “open center”
steering valve specially adapted to the high
performance requirements. The vector su-
perimposition of the positioning rates of the
drivers and engine can, in certain cases,
cause significantly higher rack-and-pinion
speeds than those of conventional steering
systems. The geometric flow of the vane-
type power steering pump with flow rate
controller is designed for the theoretical
maximum positioning rate. Regulation at
the output side provides a highly dynamic
and quiet energy supply for the active
 steering system.

Active steering

Method of operation

Method of operation

Activation concept
The actuator adjustment at the front axle,
which takes place independently of the dri-
ver, requires a complex activation concept
that is implemented in an ECU with two
processors that communicate with each
other. One processor is responsible for acti-
vating the servomotor, the other for calcu-
lating the correct control angle. Both proces-
sors monitor each other to ensure that they
are functioning properly. The movement
status of the steering gear is detected using
one angle sensor each on the steering pinion
and servomotor. The steering wheel angle
signal is also used as the setpoint specifica-
tion from the driver. Sensors for yaw veloc-
ity, lateral acceleration and wheel speed,
which are already in place for the driving
stability systems (ESP), provide additional
input signals for the active steering. 

The ECU is networked to the system using

powertrain CAN and the new chassis CAN
at the required high data rate (see Fig. 3).
Approximately 100 times a second, the nec-
essary data are collected using sensors and
evaluated by the ECU. The ECU then de-
cides whether, and by what amount, the
steering angle needs to be changed. At low
speeds, it adds an amount proportional to
the steering angle; at high speeds, it sub-

tracts a corresponding amount. Therefore,
from the driver’s point of view, the impres-
sion given is of a steering ratio that is vari-
able over the driving speed. The steering 
effort remains largely constant over a wide
speed range. Except at extremely low speeds,
a significantly greater steering angle than
180° is required.

Driving stabilization 
To calculate the stabilizing steering interven-
tion, the vehicle movement variables of yaw
angular acceleration and lateral acceleration
are returned and compared in the stabiliza-
tion controller with the setpoint specified by
the driver, which is made up of the steering
wheel angle and driving speed (Fig. 4).

Setpoint value
The setpoint for the control angle to be set,
which is calculated in the ECU of the active
steering, can be separated into a part with
open-loop control and a part with closed-
loop control. The open-loop control part,
known simply as the variable steering ratio,
by definition is calculated from the reference
variable only, the driver’s steering angle.
 Additional information from the closed-
loop control system known as the “vehicle”
provides the basis for the closed-loop part.
The partial setpoints meet at a convergence
point. They modify the response of the vehi-

cle closed-loop con-
trol system to the dri-
ver’s steering input.
These steering inter-
ventions are usually
continuous and thus
do not disturb the
driver.

 comparable to familiar, manageable distur-
bances such as those caused by crosswinds
or rail grooves in the road.

Active steering requires no additional con-
trol elements because all of its subfunctions
are activated automatically when the engine
is started. If the internal combustion engine
is not working (while the vehicle is being
towed), the active steering, like conventional
power steering, is disabled. Such situations
are indicated by a lamp in the instrument
cluster.

Benefits of active steering
for the driver

(cid:0) Driving errors are corrected or compen-
sated for in such a way that the driver is
not surprised by the vehicle’s reaction.
(cid:0) The steering ratio, which depends on the
driving situation, makes it easier to ma-
neuver the car at very low speeds, as fewer
complete turns of the steering wheel are
required with the same amount of effort. 
(cid:0) Greater convenience and comfort at high
speeds, as the driver no longer needs to
fear losing control of the car by acciden-
tally applying too much steering force.
(cid:0) The steering lead is another comfort and
convenience feature. It allows more agile
activation in response to the steering
command.

Cooperation with driving stability systems
Compared to conventional driving stability
systems based on wheel slip control, driving
stabilization via steering intervention at the
front axle has different characteristics:
(cid:0) The steering intervention is considerably
less noticeable to the driver than the
clearly audible braking intervention.
(cid:0) The steering intervention is faster than a
radial braking intervention, which re-
quires a certain pressure build-up time.

(cid:0) The braking intervention provides
 superior stabilization performance
than the steering.

By combining active steering (steering inter-
vention) and wheel slip control (braking in-
tervention), optimum driving stabilization is
attained. 

Safety concept

If the servomotor has to be switched off due
to a fault, this path is mechanically blocked.
The planetary gear then rolls off internally
while the worm gear is blocked, and the ve-
hicle remains steerable with no restrictions
and at a constant gear ratio. Thus active
steering is possible even if the mechanical
connection fails. This is a great advantage
over pure “steer-by-wire” systems. In active
steering, all relevant input signals are safe-
guarded by redundant sensors or measure-
ments. Two different processors calculate the
setpoint signal in the ECU. Although the
conversion of the setpoint signal in the
electromechanical converter takes place in
one channel only, no unwanted actuation in
the region relevant to vehicle dynamics is
possible due to the selection of a BLDC
 motor. 

The safety concept is expanded by adding an
adapted shutoff concept. Function shutoffs
range from temporary or long-term dis-
abling of the driving stabilization to limited
vehicle operation with substitute values all
the way to complete shutoff of the entire
system. The state transitions here are

Occupant protection systems

Vehicle safety, seat belts, seat belt pretensioners

Occupant protection systems

In the event of an accident, occupant
 protection systems are intended to keep
the accelerations and forces that act on the
passengers low and lessen the consequences
of the accident.

Vehicle safety

Active safety systems help to prevent accidents
and thus make a preventative contribution to
road traffic safety. One example of an active
driving safety system is the antilock braking
system (ABS) with electronic stability pro-
gram (ESP) from Bosch, which stabilizes the
vehicle even in critical braking situations and
maintains steerability in the process. 

Passive safety systems help to protect the
occupants against serious or even fatal in-
juries. An example of passive safety are
airbags, which protect the occupants after
an unavoidable impact. 

Seat belts, seat belt
 pretensioners

Function
The function of seat belts is to restrain the
 occupants of a vehicle in their seats when the
vehicle impacts against an obstacle. 

Seat belt pretensioners improve the restrain-
ing characteristics of a three-point inertia
reel belt and increase protection against in-
jury. In the event of a frontal impact, they
pull the seat belts tighter against the body
and hold the upper body as closely as possi-
ble against the seat backrest. This prevents
excessive forward displacement of the occu-
pants caused by inertia (Fig. 1).

Method of operation
In a frontal impact with a solid obstacle at a
speed of 50 km/h, the seat belts must absorb
a level of energy comparable to the kinetic
energy of a person dropping in free fall from
the fifth floor of a building. 

Due to a loose belt (“seat belt slack”), seat

belt stretch and the film-reel effect, three-
point inertia reel belts provide only limited
protection in frontal impacts against solid
obstacles at speeds of over 40 km/h because
they can no longer safely prevent the head
and body from impacting against the steer-
ing wheel or the instrument panel. Without
a restraint system, an occupant experiences
extensive forward displacement (Fig. 2). 
In an impact, the shoulder belt tightener
eliminates the seat belt slack and the “film-
reel effect” by rolling up and tightening the

belt webbing. At an im-
pact speed of 50 km/h,
this system achieves its
full effect within the
first 20 ms of impact;
this supports the
airbag, which needs ap-
prox. 40 ms to inflate
completely. After that,
an occupant continues
to move forwards by a
certain amount,
thereby expelling the
gas (N2) from the
airbag so that the occu-
pant’s kinetic energy is
dissipated in a rela-
tively gradual manner.
This protects occu-
pants from injury

 because it prevents impact with rigid parts
of the  vehicle structure.

A prerequisite for optimum protection is
that the occupants’ forward movement away
from their seats must be minimal as they
 decelerate with the vehicle. Activation of
the seat belt pretensioners takes care of this
virtually from the moment of impact, and
ensures restraint of occupants as early as
possible. The maximum forward displace-
ment with tightened seat belts is approx.
2 cm and the duration of mechanical tight-
ening is 5-10 ms.

On activation, the system electrically fires a
pyrotechnic propellant charge. The rising
pressure acts on a piston, which turns the
belt reel via a steel cable in such a way that
the belt is held tightly against the body
(Fig. 3).

Variants
In addition to the described shoulder belt
tighteners for rewinding the belt reel shaft,
there are variants which pull the seat belt
buckle back (buckle tighteners) and simulta-
neously tighten the shoulder and lap belts.
Buckle tighteners further improve the re-
straining effect and the protection to pre-
vent occupants from sliding forward under
the lap belt (“submarining effect”). The
tightening process in these two systems takes
place in the same period of time as for
shoulder belt tighteners.

A larger degree of tightener travel for
achieving a better restraining effect is pro-
vided by the combination of two seat belt
pretensioners for each (front) seat, which,
on the Renault Laguna for instance, consist
of a shoulder belt tightener and a belt buckle
tightener. The belt buckle tightener is acti-
vated either only in an impact above a cer-
tain degree of severity, or with a certain time
lag (e.g. approx. 7 ms) relative to activation
of the shoulder belt tightener.

Occupant protection systems

Seat belts, seat belt pretensioners, front airbag

Apart from pyrotechnical seat belt preten-
sioners, there are also mechanical versions.
In the case of a mechanical tightener, a me-
chanical or electrical sensor releases a preten-
sioned spring, which pulls the seat belt buckle
back. The sole advantage of these systems is
that they are cheaper. However, their deploy-
ment characteristics are not so well synchro-
nized with the deployment of the airbag as
pyrotechnical seat belt pretensioners, which,
of course, have the same electronic impact-
sensing equipment as the front airbags.

In order to achieve optimum protection,
the response of all components of the com-
plete occupant protection system, compris-
ing seat belt pretensioners and airbags for
frontal impacts, must be adapted to one an-
other. Seat belts and seat belt pretensioners
provide the greater part of the protective 
effect since they absorb 50-60% of impact
energy alone. With front airbags, the energy
absorption is about 70% if deployment tim-
ing is properly synchronized. 

A further improvement, which prevents
collarbone and rib fractures and the result-
ing internal injuries to more elderly occu-
pants, can be achieved by belt force limiters.
In this case, the seat belt tighteners initially
tighten fully (using the maximum force of
approx. 4 kN, for example) and restrain the
occupants to maximum possible effect. If a
certain belt tension is exceeded, the belt
gives and allows a greater degree of forward
movement. The kinetic energy is converted
into deformation energy so that acceleration
peaks are avoided. Examples of deformation
elements include:
(cid:0) Torsion bar (belt reel shaft)
(cid:0) Rip seam in the belt
(cid:0) Seat belt buckle with deformation element
(cid:0) Shearing element

DaimlerChrysler, for example, has an elec-
tronically controlled single-stage belt force
limiter, which reduces the belt tension to 
1-2 kN by firing a detonator a specific pe-
riod after deployment of the second front
airbag stage and after a specific extent of
 forward movement is reached.

Further developments
The performance of pyrotechnical seat belt
pretensioners is constantly being improved.
“High-performance tighteners” are capable
of retracting an extended belt length of
about 15 cm in roughly 5 ms. In the future
there will also be two-stage belt force lim-
iters consisting of two torsion bars with
staggered response or a single torsion bar
combined with an extra deformation plate
in the retractor.

Front airbag

Function
The function of front airbags is to protect
the driver and front passenger against head
and chest injuries in a vehicle impact with a
solid obstacle at speeds of up to 60 km/h. In
case of a frontal impact of two vehicles, the
front airbags provide protection at relative
speeds of up to 100 km/h. In a serious acci-
dent, a seat belt pretensioner cannot keep
the head from striking the steering wheel.
In order to fulfill this function, airbags have
different filling capacities and shapes to suit
varying vehicle requirements, depending on
where they are fitted, the vehicle type, and
its structure deformation characteristics. 
In a few vehicle types, front airbags also
operate in conjunction with “inflatable knee
pads”, which safeguard the “ride down bene-
fit”, i.e. the speed decrease of the occupants
together with the speed decrease of the pas-
senger cell. This ensures that the upper body
and head describe the rotational forward
motion needed for the airbag to provide
 optimum protection, and is of particular
benefit in countries where seat belt usage
is not mandatory.

Method of operation
To protect driver and front passenger, py-
rotechnical gas inflators inflate the driver
and passenger airbags using dynamic py-
rotechnics after a vehicle impact detected by
sensors. In order for the affected occupant to
enjoy maximum protection, the airbag must
be fully inflated before the occupant comes

into contact with it. On contact with the up-
per body, the airbag partly deflates in order
to “gently” absorb impact energy acting on
the occupant with noncritical (in terms of
injury) surface pressures and declaration
forces. This concept significantly reduces or
even prevents head and chest injuries. 

The maximum permissible forward displace-
ment before the driver’s airbag is fully in-
flated is approx. 12.5 cm, corresponding to a
period of approx. 10 ms + 30 ms = 40 ms after
the initial impact (at 50 km/h with a solid 
obstacle) (see Fig. 2). It takes 10 ms for elec-
tronic firing to take place and 30 ms for the
airbag to inflate (Fig. 4).

In a 50 km/h crash, the airbag takes ap-
prox. 40 ms to inflate fully and a further 
80-100 ms to deflate through the deflation
holes. The entire process takes little more
than a tenth of a second, i.e. the bat of an
eyelid. 

Impact detection
Optimum occupant protection against the
effects of frontal, offset, oblique or pole
 impact is obtained (as mentioned above)
through the precisely coordinated interac-
tion of electronically detonated pyrotechni-
cal front airbags and seat belt pretensioners.
To maximize the effect of both protective
devices, they are activated with optimized
time response by a common ECU (trigger
unit) installed in the passenger cell. This in-
volves the electronic control unit using one
or two electronic linear acceleration sensors
to measure the deceleration occurring on
impact and calculate the change in velocity.
In order to be able to better detect oblique
and offset impacts, the deployment algo-
rithm can also take account of the signal
from the lateral acceleration sensor.

The impact must also be analyzed. The
airbag should not trigger from a hammer
blow in the workshop, gentle impacts, bot-
toming out, driving over a curbstone or a
pothole. With this goal in mind, the sensor
signals are processed in digital analysis algo-
rithms whose sensitivity parameters have

been optimized with the aid of crash data
simulations. The first seat belt pretensioner
trigger threshold is reached within 8-30 ms
depending on the type of impact, and the
first front airbag trigger threshold after ap-
prox. 10-50 ms.

The acceleration signals, which are influenced
by such factors as the vehicle equipment and
the body’s deformation characteristics, are
different for each vehicle. They determine the
setting parameters which are of crucial im-
portance for sensitivity in the analysis algo-
rithm (computing process) and, ultimately,
for triggering the airbag and seat belt preten-
sioner. Depending on the vehicle manufac-
turer’s production concept, the deployment
parameters and the vehicle’s equipment level
can also be programmed into the ECU at the
end of the assembly line (“end-of-line pro-
gramming”). 

In order to prevent injuries caused by airbags
or fatalities to “out-of-position” occupants 
or to small children in child seats with auto-
matic child seat detection, it is essential that
the front airbags are triggered and inflated in
accordance with the particular situations.
The following improvement measures are
available for this purpose:
1. Deactivation switches. These switches can
be used to deactivate the driver or passen-
ger airbag. The status of the airbag func-
tion is indicated by special lamps.
2. In the USA, where approximately 160
 fatalities have been caused by airbags,
 attempts are being made to reduce aggres-
sive inflation by introducing “depowered
airbags”. These are airbags whose gas in-
flator power has been reduced by 20-30%,
which itself reduces inflation speed, infla-
tion severity and the risk of injury to
“out-of-position” occupants. “Depowered
airbags” can be depressed more easily by
large and heavy occupants, i.e. they have a
reduced energy absorption capacity. It is
therefore essential – above all with regard
to the possibility of severe frontal impacts
– for occupants to fasten their seat belts.

In the USA, the “low-risk” deployment
method is currently preferred. This means
that in “out-of-position” situations, only
the first front airbag stage is triggered. In
heavy impacts, the full gas inflator output
can then be brought into effect by trigger-
ing both inflator stages. Another way of
implementing “low-risk” deployment
with single-stage inflators and control-
lable deflation vents is to keep the defla-
tion valve constantly open.

3. “Intelligent airbag systems”. The introduc-
tion of more and improved sensing func-
tions and control options for the airbag
inflation process, with the accompanying
improvement in protective effect, is in-
tended to result in a gradual reduction 
in the risk of injury. Such functional im-
provements are:

– Impact severity detection by improve-

ments in the deployment algorithm or the
use of one or two upfront sensors, refer to
“restraint system electronics”, RSE (Fig. 5)
These are acceleration sensors installed in
the vehicle’s crumple zone (e.g. on the ra-
diator crossmember) which facilitate early
detection of impacts that are difficult to
detect centrally, such as ODB (offset de-
formable barrier) crashes, pole or under-
ride impacts. They also allow an assess-
ment of the impact energy:

– Use of front airbags with two-stage gas

Front airbag, side airbag

167

Method of operation
Due to the lack of a crumple zone, and the
minimum distance between the occupants
and the vehicle’s side structural components,
it is particularly difficult for side airbags to
inflate in time. In the case of severe impacts,
therefore, the time needed for impact detec-
tion and activation of the side airbags must
be approx. 5-10 ms and the time needed to
inflate the approx. 12 l thorax bags must not
exceed 10 ms. 

Bosch offers the following option to meet
the above requirements: an instrument clus-
ter ECU, which processes the input signals 
of peripheral (mounted at suitable points on
the body), side-sensing acceleration sensors,
and which can trigger side airbags as well 
as the seat belt pretensioners and the front
airbags.

belt buckle and door switch status) and
for activation of warning lamps and
transmission of diagnostic data.

For transmission of emergency calls after a
crash and for activation of “secondary safety
systems” (hazard warning signals, central
locking release, fuel supply pump shutoff,
battery disconnection etc.) the “crash out-
put” is used (Fig. 6).

Side airbag

Function
Side impacts make up approx. 30% of all 
accidents. This makes the side collision the
second most common type of impact after
the frontal impact. An increasing number of
vehicles are therefore being fitted with side
airbags in addition to seat belt pretensioners
and front airbags. Side airbags, which inflate
along the length of the roof lining for head
protection (inflatable tubular systems, win-
dow bags, inflatable curtains) or from the
door or seat backrest (thorax bags, upper
body protection) are designed to cushion
the occupants and protect them from injury
in the event of a side impact.

Acceleration sensors
Acceleration sensors for impact detection
are integrated directly in the control unit
(seat belt pretensioners, front airbag), and
mounted in selected positions on both sides
of the vehicle on supporting structural
components such as seat crossmembers,
sills, B and C-pillars (side airbags) or in the
crumple zone at the front of the vehicle
(upfront sensors for “intelligent airbag sys-
tems”). The precision of these sensors is

crucial in saving lives. Nowadays, those
 acceleration sensors are surface microme-
chanical sensors consisting of fixed and
moving finger structures and spring pins.
A special process is used to incorporate the
“spring-mass system” on the surface of a
 silicon wafer. Since the  sensors have only 
a low working capacitance (≈ 1 pF), it is
necessary to accommodate the evaluation
electronics in the same housing in the im-
mediate proximity of the sensor  element 
so as to avoid stray capacitance and other
forms of interference.

Combined ECUs for seat belt
 pretensioners, front and side airbags
and rollover protection equipment
The following functions are incorporated in
the central ECU, also referred to as the
 trigger unit (current list): 
(cid:0) Crash sensing by acceleration sensor and

safety switch or by two acceleration
 sensors without safety switch (redundant,
fully electronic sensing).

(cid:0) Rollover detection by yaw rate and low g,
y and z acceleration sensors (refer to the
section on “Rollover sensing”).

(cid:0) Prompt activation of front airbags and

seat belt pretensioners in response to dif-
ferent types of impact in the vehicle longi-
tudinal direction (e.g. frontal, oblique,
offset, pole, rear-end).

(cid:0) Activation of rollover protection equip-

ment.

(cid:0) For the side airbags, the ECU operates in
conjunction with a central lateral sensor
and two or four peripheral acceleration
sensors. The peripheral acceleration sen-
sors (PAS) transmit the triggering com-
mand to the central ECU via a digital inter-
face. The central ECU triggers the side
airbags provided the internal lateral sensor
has confirmed a side impact by means of a
plausibility check. Since the central plausi-
bility confirmation arrives too late in the
case of impacts into the door or above the
sill, peripheral pressure sensors (PPS) in-
side the door cavity are to be used in the
future to measure the adiabatic pressure
changes caused by deformation of the
door. This will result in rapid detection of
door impacts. Confirmation of “plausibil-
ity” is now provided by PAS mounted on
supporting peripheral structural compo-
nents. This is now unquestionably faster
than the central lateral acceleration
 sensors.

(cid:0) Voltage transformer and energy accumu-
lator in case the supply of power from the
vehicle battery fails. 

(cid:0) Selective triggering of the seat belt preten-
sioners, depending on monitored belt
buckle status: firing only takes place if key

is in the ignition switch. At present, prox-
imity-type seat belt buckle switches are
used, i.e. Hall-effect IC switches which
 detect the change in the magnetic field
when the buckle is fastened.

(cid:0) Setting of multiple triggering thresholds
for two-stage seat belt pretensioners and
two-stage front airbags depending on the
status of belt use and seat occupation.
(cid:0) Watchdog (WD): Airbag triggering units
must meet high safety standards with re-
gard to false activation in non-crash situa-
tions and correct activation when needed
(crashes). For this reason, the ninth-gen-
eration airbag triggering unit (AB 9), in-
troduced in 2003, incorporate three inde-
pendent, intensive monitoring hardware
watchdogs (WDs): 
WD1 uses its own independent oscillator
to monitor the 2-MHz system clock.
WD2 monitors the realtime processes
(time base 500 µs) for correct and com-
plete sequence. For this reason, the safety
controller (SCON; refer to the AB 9 block
diagram) sends the microcomputer 8 dig-
ital messages, to which it must respond 
by sending 8 correct replies to the SCON
within a time window of (1 ± 0.3) ms.
WD3 monitors the “background”
processes such as the “built-in self-test”
routines of the ARM core for correct op-
eration. The microcomputer’s response to
the SCON in this case must be provided
within a period of 100 ms. 
On AB 9 sensors, analyzer modules and
output stages are linked by two serial pe-
ripheral interfaces (SPIs). The sensors
have digital outputs whose signals can 
be transmitted directly via SPIs. Signal
changes can then be detected by line con-
nections on the printed circuit board, or
else they have no effect and a high level of
functional reliability is achieved. Deploy-
ment is only permitted if an independent
hardware plausibility channel also detects
an impact and enables the output stages
for a limited period.

(cid:0) Diagnosis of internal and external func-

tions and of system components.

(cid:0) Storage of fault types and duration with

Gas inflators
The pyrotechnical propellant charges of the
gas inflators for generating the airbag infla-
tion gas (mainly nitrogen) and for actuating
seat belt pretensioners are activated by an
electrically operated firing element.

The gas inflator in question inflates the
airbag with nitrogen. The driver airbag built
into the steering wheel hub (volume approx.
60 l) or, as the case may be, the passenger
airbag fitted in the glove box space (approx.
120 l) is inflated in approx. 30 ms after deto-
nation.

AC firing
In order to prevent inadvertent triggering
through contact between the firing element
and the vehicle system voltage (e.g. faulty in-
sulation in the wiring harness), AC firing is
used. This involves firing by alternating-cur-
rent pulses at approx. 80 kHz. A small capac-
itor with a capacitance of 470 nF incorpo-
rated in the firing circuit in the firing ele-
ment plug electrically isolates the firing

element from the DC current. This isolation
from the vehicle system voltage prevents in-
advertent triggering, even after an accident
when the airbag remains untriggered and
the occupants have to be freed from the 
deformed passenger cell by emergency 
services. It may even be necessary to cut
through the (permanent +) firing circuit
wires in the steering column wiring harness
and short-circuit them according to positive
and ground. 

Passenger compartment sensing
Occupant classification mats (“OC mats”),
which measure the pressure profile on the
seat, are used to distinguish whether the seat
is occupied by a person or by an object. In
addition, the pressure distribution and the
pelvic bone spacing are used to indicate the
occupant’s size and thus indirectly the occu-
pant’s weight. The mats consist of individu-
ally addressable force sensing points which
reduce their resistance according to the FSR
principle force sensing resistor) as pressure
increases.

In addition, absolute weight measurement us-
ing four piezo-resistive sensors or wire strain
gauges on the seat frame is also under devel-
opment. Instead of using deformation ele-
ments, the Bosch strategy for weight mea-
surement involves the use of “iBolts” (“intel-
ligent” bolts) for fixing the seat frame (seat
cradle) to the sliding base. These force sens-
ing “iBolts” (Fig. 5 and 7) replace the four
fixing bolts otherwise used. 

They measure the weight-dependent
change in the gap between the bolt sleeve
and the internal bolt with integral Hall-
 element IC connected to the sliding base.
Four different concepts are under considera-
tion for detecting “out-of-position” situa-
tions:

pant’s center of gravity from the weight

cupant. The time intervals being mea-

video camera using CMOS technology
(the option favored by Bosch, see system
diagram of “restraint system electronics,
RSE”). This detects occupant position,
size and restraint method and can also
control convenience functions (seat,
mirror and radio settings) to suit the 
individual occupant.

No unified standard for passenger compart-
ment sensing has yet been able to establish
itself. Jaguar, for example, uses occupant
classification mats combined with ultrasonic
sensors.

Rollover protection systems

Function
In the event of an accident where the vehicle
rolls over, open-top vehicles such as convert-
ibles, off-road vehicles etc., lack the protect-
ing and supporting roof structure of closed-
top vehicles. Initially, therefore, rollover
sensing and protection systems were only in-
stalled in convertibles and roadsters without
fixed rollover bars (Fig. 8).

Now engineers are developing rollover sens-
ing for use in closed passenger cars. If a car
turns over, there is the danger that non-
belted occupants may be thrown through
the side windows and crushed by their own
vehicle, or the arms, heads or torsos of
belted occupants may protrude from the
 vehicle and be seriously injured.

To provide protection in such cases,

Occupant protection systems

Rollover protection systems, outlook

seat belt pretensioners and head airbags are
activated. In convertibles, the extendable
rollover bars or the extendable head
 restraints are also triggered.

Method of operation
The earlier sensing concepts (from mid-
1989) were based on an omnidirectional
sensing function. In other words, a rollover
in any direction from the horizontal should
be detectable. For this purpose, manufactur-
ers used either all-around-sensing accelera-
tion sensors that were AND-wired to an om-
nidirectional tilt sensor or level gauge (water
level principle) and gravitation sensors (sen-
sor closes a spring-assisted reed switch when
contact with the ground is lost).

Current sensing concepts no longer trigger
the system at a fixed threshold but rather at
a threshold that conforms to a situation and
only for the most common rollover situa-
tion, i.e. about the longitudinal axis. The
Bosch sensing concept involves a surface 
micromechanical yaw sensor and high-reso-
lution acceleration sensors in the vehicle’s
transverse and vertical axes (y and z axes).
The yaw rate sensor is the main sensor,
while the y and z-axis acceleration sensors
are used both to check plausibility and to
detect the type of rollover (slope, gradient,
curb impact or “soil-trip” rollover). On
Bosch systems, these sensors are incorpo-
rated in the airbag triggering unit.

Deployment of occupant protection sys-
tems is adapted to the situation according to
the type of turnover, the yaw rate and the
lateral acceleration, i.e. systems are triggered
after between 30 and 3000 ms by automatic
selection and use of the algorithm module
appropriate to the type of rollover.

Outlook

In addition to front airbag shutoff using de-
activation switches, soon there will also be
an increasing number of child seats with
standardized anchor systems (“ISOFIX child
seats”). Switches integrated in the anchoring

locks initiate an automatic passenger airbag
shutoff, which must be indicated by a special
lamp.

For further improvement of the deploy-
ment function and better advance detection
of the type of impact (“pre-crash” detection),
microwave radar, ultrasound or lidar sensors
(optical system using laser light) will be used
to detect relative speed, distance and angle of
impact for frontal impacts (Fig. 9).

In connection with pre-crash sensing, re-
versible seat belt pretensioners are being devel-
oped. They are electromechanically actuated,
i.e. they take longer to tighten, and must be
triggered earlier, i.e. 150 ms before initial impact,
by pre-crash sensing alone (prefire  function).

A further improvement in the restraining
effect will be provided by airbags integrated
in the thorax section of the seat belt (“air
belts”, “inflatable tubular torso restraints” or
“bag-in-belt” systems), which will reduce the
risk of broken ribs in older occupants.

The same path for improving protective
functions is being pursued by engineers de-
veloping “inflatable headrests” (adaptive
head restraints for preventing whiplash
trauma and cervical injuries), “inflatable car-
pets” (prevention of foot and ankle injuries),
two-stage seat belt pretensioners and “active
seats”. In the case of “active seats”, an airbag
made of thin steel sheet (!) is inflated to pre-
vent occupants sliding forwards under the
lap belt (“submarining effect”).

To reduce wiring harness size and complex-
ity, firing circuit networking is being devel-
oped. The “Safe-by-Wire” bus (originally de-
veloped by Philips) is an example of a prod-
uct for such applications. More recently, a
consortium of companies, including Bosch,
has been formed with the aim of developing
a line production “Safe-by-Wire” firing bus.
The current designation for the “Safe-by-
Wire” bus is the “ASRB2.0” bus, short for
“Automotive safety restraints bus 2.0”. The
DSI bus (developed by Motorola for TRW)
also continues to be used. However, it is still
entirely uncertain whether a firing bus con-
cept will become established.

Occupant protection systems

Outlook

173

Signals from “slow" sensors or switches (e.g.
the seat belt buckle or ISOFIX switches) can
also be transmitted by the firing bus.
Efforts are currently underway in the USA 
to standardize the “ASRB2.0” bus concept.
Standardization is imperative in order to en-
sure market penetration and the potential
usability of standardized firing elements
with standardized bus device electronics. 
Efforts are underway to integrate the re-
ceiver electronics in the firing elements,
without increasing diameter and while
maintaining a maximum cap extension of
5 mm. This would increase the usability of
standard gas inflators.

In addition to the “firing bus”, there will
also be a “sensor bus” for networking the
signals of “fast” sensors. This will make it
possible to combine inertial sensors, for in-
stance, in a “sensor cluster”. The overall pic-
ture of vehicle dynamics can then be made
available via CAN to the evaluation chips of
various vehicle systems. Conceivable sensor
buses include TT CAN time-triggered
CAN), TTP time-triggered protocol) and
FlexRay, the option currently favored by
Bosch. The requirements of a sensor bus

Pre-crash traffic situation

 regarding transmission reliability and speed
are extremely high.

The first phase of legally required mea-
sures for improving pedestrian protection
can be expected in 2005. Therefore, OEMs
urgently need to develop solutions for their
new models to meet the pedestrian trauma
limits which will then be in force and which
in most cases will be achievable by passive
design features (body shape, use of impact-
absorbing materials). Enactment of the 
second stage of the legislation (in approxi-
mately 2010) providing for even lower
trauma limits will then require active safety
features, i.e. pedestrian impact will have to
be detected and protective actuators
 actuated. 

Pedestrian impact sensing will initially be im-
plemented by deformation or force sensors in
the fender and possibly the front of the hood,
e.g. in the form of
(cid:0) Fiber-optic cables which utilize the

 “microbending” effect

(cid:0) Film pressure sensors (as in occupant

classification mats)

(cid:0) Acceleration sensors or knock sensors on

the fender crossmembers

features.
The first example of the synergetic use of
sensors in different safety systems will be
implemented in ROSE II (rollover sensing
II). ROSE II will utilize the signals avail-
able on the CAN from the speed vector
sensor for improved detection of soil trip
rollover situations. The speed vector sen-
sor is part of the ESP system and is used
to measure the deviation of the vehicle
motion vector from the vehicle’s longitu-
dinal axis. The ESP, on the other hand,
can utilize the signals from the ROSE II
low-g acceleration sensors (y and z axes)
for improved detection of unstable
 dynamic handling situations.

174

Occupant protection systems

Outlook

At a later date contactless sensors will be
used to reliably distinguish between a pedes-
trian and an object. These might, for in-
stance, be:
(cid:0) Ultrasonic sensors or
(cid:0) External stereo video cameras

The protective actuators consist of A-pillar
airbags and hoods which can be raised by
approx. 10 cm so that, if impacted by a
pedestrian’s head, they are not depressed far
enough to come in contact with the rigid
engine components due to the greater clear-
ance. As a result, the trauma suffered is less
severe. 

In Europe, 7000 pedestrians are killed every
year. That Figure represents 20% of the total
number of road accident fatalities. In Japan,
for example, there are 17,000 pedestrian
deaths a year. For this reason, legislators in
Japan are deliberating whether to make
safety features for pedestrians a legal
 requirement as in Europe.

The following additional improvements for
softer cushioning of occupants are also
likely:
1. Airbags with active ventilation system:

These airbags have a controllable deflation
valve to maintain the internal pressure of
the airbag constant even if an occupant
falls against it and to minimize occupant
trauma. A simpler version is an airbag
with “intelligent vents”. These vents re-
main closed (so that the airbag does not
deflate) until the pressure increase result-
ing from the impact of the occupant
causes them to open and allow the airbag
to deflate. As a result, the airbag’s energy
absorption capacity is fully maintained
until the point at which its motion-damp-
ing function comes into effect.
2. Adaptive, pyrotechnically triggered

 steering column release.
This allows the steering wheel to move
forward in a severe impact so that the
 occupant can be more softly cushioned
over a greater distance of travel.

Piezoelectric acceleration sensor (dual sensor for

1

Application
Piezoelectric bimorphous bending elements
and two-layer piezoceramic elements are
used as acceleration sensors in passenger-
 restraint systems for triggering the seat-belt
tighteners, the airbags, and the roll-over bar.

Design and operating concept
A piezo bending element is at the heart of
this acceleration sensor. It is a bonded struc-
ture comprising two piezoelectric layers of
opposite polarities (“bimorphous bending
element”). When subjected to acceleration,
one half of this structure bends and the
other compresses, so that a mechanical
bending stress results (Fig. 1).

The voltage resulting from the element
bend is picked off at the electrodes attached
to the sensor element’s outside metallised
surfaces. 

The sensor element shares a hermetically-
sealed housing with the initial signal-ampli-
fication stage, and is sometimes encased in
gel for mechanical protection.

For signal conditioning, the acceleration
sensor is provided with a hybrid circuit
comprised of an impedance converter, a fil-
ter, and an amplifier. This serves to define
the sensitivity and useful frequency range.
The filter suppresses the high-frequency sig-
nal components. When subjected to acceler-
ation, the piezo bending elements deflect to
such an extent due to their own mass that
they generate a dynamic, easy-to-evaluate
non-DC signal with a maximum frequency
which is typically 10 Hz. 

By “reversing” the actuator principle and ap-
plying voltage, the sensor’s correct operation
can be checked within the framework of
OBD “on-board diagnosis”. All that is re-
quired is an additional actuator electrode. 

Depending upon installation position and
direction of acceleration, there are single 
or dual sensors available (Fig. 2). Sensors 
are also on the market which are designed
specifically for vertical or horizontal mount-
ing (Fig. 2).

Surface micromechanical acceleration sensors

Surface micromechanical
 acceleration sensors

Application
Surface micromechanical acceleration sen-
sors are used in passenger-restraint systems
to register the acceleration values of a frontal
or side collision. They serve to trigger the
seatbelt tightener, the airbag, and the roll-
over bar.

Design and operating concept
Although these sensors were initially in-
tended for use with higher accelerations
(50...100 g), they also operate with lower ac-
celeration figures when used in passenger-
restraint systems. They are much smaller
than the bulk silicon sensors (typical edge
length: approx. 100...500 µm), and are
mounted together with their evaluation
electronics  (ASIC) in a waterproof casing
(Fig. 1). An additive process is used to build
up their spring-mass system on the surface
of the silicon wafer.

The seismic mass with its comb-like elec-
trodes (Figs. 2 and 3, pos. 1) is spring-
mounted in the measuring cell. There are
fixed comb-like electrodes (3, 6) on the chip
on each side of these movable electrodes.
This configuration comprising fixed amd
movable electrodes corresponds to a series
circuit comprising two differential capaci-
tors (capacity of the comb-like structure: ap-
prox. 1 pF). Opposed-phase AC voltages are
applied across the terminals C1 and C2, and
their superimpositions picked-off between
the capacitors at CM (measurement ca -
pacity), in other words at the seismic mass.

Since the seismic mass is spring-mounted
(2), linear acceleration in the sensing direc-
tion  results in a change of the spacing be-
tween the fixed and movable electrodes, and
therefore also to a change in the capacity of
C1 and C2 which in turn causes the electrical
signal to change. In the evaluation electron-
ics circuit, this change is amplified, and then
filtered and digitalised ready for further sig-
nal processing in the airbag ECU. Due to the
low capacity of approx. 1 pF, the evaluation
electronics is situated at the sensor and is

 either integrated with the sensor on the
same chip, or is located very close to it.
Closed-loop position controls with electro-
static return are also available. 

The evaluation circuit incorporates func-

tions for sensor-deviation compensation
and for self-diagnosis during the sensor
start-up phase. During self-diagnosis, elec-
trostatic forces are applied to deflect the
comb-like structure and simulate the
processes which take place during acceler -
ation in the vehicle. 

Dual micromechanical sensors (4) are used
for instance in the ESP Electronic Stability
Program for vehicle dynamics control: Basi-
cally, these consist of two individual sensors,
whereby a micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
and a micromechanical acceleration sensor
are combined to form a single unit. This re-
duces the number of individual components
and signal lines, as well as requiring less
room and less attachment hardware in the
vehicle.

Occupant protection systems

Seat occupancy sensing

Design and construction
A so-called sensor mat and ECU incorpor -
ated in the vehicle’s front seats (Figs. 1 and 2)
registers the information on the person in
the seat and sends this to the airbag ECU.
These data are then applied when adapting
the restraint-system triggering to the current
situation. 

Operating concept
Measuring concept
This relies upon the classification of passen-
gers (OC) according to their physical
charac teristics (weight, height, etc.), and
 applying this data for optimal airbag deploy-
ment. Instead of directly "weighing" the per-
son concerned, the OC system primarily
 applies the correlation between the person’s
weight and his/her anthropometric1) char-
acteristics (such as distance between hip-
bones). To do so, the OC sensor mat mea-
sures the pressure profile on the seat surface.
Evaluation indicates first of all whether the
seat is occupied or not, and further analysis
permits the person concerned to be allo-
cated to a certain classsification (Fig. 3). 

Seat occupancy sensing

Assignment
Following introduction of the airbag for the
front-seat passenger, safety and actuarial
considerations made it necessary to detect
whether the front-seat passenger’s seat is oc-
cupied or not. Otherwise, when an accident
occurs and both front airbags are deployed,
unnecessary repair costs result if the passen-
ger seat is unoccupied. 

The development of the so-called "Smart
Bags" marked an increase in the demand for
the ability to detect occupation of the dri-
ver-seat and front-passenger seat. The smart
bag should feature variable deployment
adapted to the actual situation and occupa-
tion of the seats. In certain situations, airbag
triggering must be prevented when deploy-
ment would be injurious to one of the vehi-
cle’s occupants (for instance, if a child is sit-
ting in the seat next to the driver, or a child’s
safety seat is fitted). This led to further de-
velopment of the "simple" seat-occupation
detection to form the "intelligent" Occupa-
tion Classification (OC). In addition, the
 automatic detection of a child’s safety seat
is integrated as a further sensory function. 
It can detect whether or not the child seats,
which are equipped with transponders, are
occupied.

Seat occupancy sensing

179

Sensor technology
Basically, the OC sensor mat comprises pres-
sure-dependent FSR resistance elements
(FSR: Force-Sensitive Resistance), the infor-
mation from which can be selectively evalu-
ated. A sensor element’s electrical resistance
drops when it is subjected to increasing
mech anical load. This effect can be regis-
tered by inputting a measuring current. The
analysis of all sensor points permits defi -
nition of the size of the occupied seat area,
and of the local points of concentration of
the profile. 

A standalone sending antenna and two re-
ceive antennas in the OC sensor mat serve to
implement the ACSD function. During the
generation of a sending field, transponders
in the specially equipped child’s seats are
 excited so that they impose a code on the
sending field by means of modulation. The
data received by the receive  antenna and
evaluated by the electronic circuitry is ap-
plied in determining the type of child’s seat
and its orientation. 

ECU
The ECU feeds measuring currents into the
sensor mat and evaluates the sensor signals
with the help of an algorithm program
which runs in the microcontroller. The re-
sulting classification data and the informa-
tion on the child’s safety seat are sent to the
airbag ECU in a cyclical protocol where, via
a decision table, they help to define the trig-
gering behaviour.

Algorithm
Among other things, the following decision
criteria serve to analyse the impression of
the seating profile: 

Distance between hip-bones: 
A typical seating profile has two main im-
pression points which correspond to the
 distance between the passsenger’s hip-bones.

Occupied surface: 
Similarly, there is a correlation between the
occupied surface and the person’s weight. 

Profile coherence: 
Consideration of the profile structure.

Dynamic response: 
Change of the profile as a function of time.

Driving assistance systems

Critical driving situations, accident causes, measures

Driving assistance systems

On average, someone dies every minute
somewhere in the world as a result of a
 traffic accident. Bosch pursues the aim of
reducing the frequency and the severity of
accidents by developing active and passive
driving assistance systems. 

Critical driving situations

Driving assistance systems aim to make the
vehicle capable of perceiving its surround-
ings, interpreting them, identifying critical
situations and assisting the driver in per-
forming driving maneuvers. The object is, at
best, to prevent accidents completely and, at
worst, to minimize the consequences of an
accident for those concerned.

In critical driving situations, fractions of 

a second are often decisive in determining
whether an accident occurs or not. According
to various studies, approximately 60% of
rear-end collisions and virtually a third of
frontal impacts could have been avoided if
the driver had reacted only half a second ear-
lier. Every second accident at an intersection
could be prevented by faster driver reaction.
At the end of the 1980s, when the vision
of highly efficient and partially automated
road traffic was presented as part of the
“Prometheus” project, the electronic com-
ponents for this task were not in existence.
However, the highly sensitive sensors and
extremely powerful microcomputers now
available have brought the “sensitive” vehicle

a step nearer to realization. Sensors scan the
vehicle’s surroundings and systems generate
warnings based on the objects identified or
immediately perform the required driving
maneuvers. All of this is done more quickly
– by those decisive fractions of a second –
than even a fully attentive and experienced
driver would be capable of.

Accident causes, measures

In 2001, over 96,000 people were killed in
road traffic accidents in Europe, the USA
and Japan. The resulting cost to the various
national economies totaled more than 
€400 billion (Fig. 1). The fact that many
motorists are overburdened by the complex-
ities of road traffic situations is shown by
 recent statistics. In Germany, for example,
there were 2.37 million road accidents in
2001, 375,345 of which resulted in personal
injury. In nine out of ten cases, the cause was
human error. 

A statistical analysis of accident causes out-
side built-up areas in Germany (Fig. 2) shows
more than a third of the total number are
caused by drivers changing lanes or uninten-
tionally failing to stay in their lane. Systems
which can see the “blind spot” and lane
change alarms offer a means of reducing 
the number of accidents caused in this way.
About another third of accidents result from
“rear-ending” and frontal collisions.

Collision warning systems can represent a
first line of defense in combating such acci-
dents. A second level can be provided by colli-
sion avoidance systems which actively inter-
vene in the control of the vehicle. A first step
in this direction has already been made with
the development of ACC (adaptive cruise
control).

Accidents involving pedestrians and at in-

tersections have a high level of complexity.
Only networked sensor systems with sce-
nario interpretation capabilities can master
such complicated accident situations. This 
is one of the issues currently occupying 
researchers.

Application areas

Driving assistance systems with multiple
 applications (Fig. 3) fall into these two
 categories:
(cid:0) Safety systems aimed at preventing

 accidents

(cid:0) Comfort and convenience systems with
the long-term goal of “semi-automated
driving”.

A further distinction is made between: 
(cid:0) Active systems which intervene in vehicle

dynamics 

(cid:0) Passive, i. e. informational systems, which

do not intervene in vehicle control.

Safety and convenience

Passive safety (Fig. 3, lower left quadrant)
consists of features for lessening the conse-
quences of accidents, such as pre-crash func-
tions and pedestrian protection features. 

Systems for driver assistance without in-

tervention into vehicle control (bottom
right quadrant) represent a precursor to 
vehicle handling. Such systems merely warn
the driver or recommend maneuvers. Ex-
amples: The parking assistant first measures
the length of the parking space and indi-
cates to the driver whether it will be easy or
difficult to park in the space, or if the space
is too small. In the next stage, the system of-
fers the driver recommendations for steer-

ing the  vehicle during the parking maneu-
ver based on the measurement it has taken
of the parking space. The long-term aim for
Bosch in the development of parking sys-
tems is the autonomous parking assistant –
a system that actively intervenes in vehicle
handling and automatically maneuvers the
vehicle into the parking space. Detection of
potentially dangerous objects in the blind
spot is performed by close-range sensors
(ultrasound sensors, radar sensors or lidar
sensors). Video sensors can be effectively
used to improve visibility for the driver at
night. Lane change alarms use a video cam-
era to extrapolate the course of the lane in
front of the vehicle and warn the driver if
the vehicle leaves its lane and the direction
indicators have not been operated. The
warning can be an acoustic signal through
the sound system speakers or a mechanical
indication in the form of a small turning
force applied to the steering wheel.

ACC, which is already installed in vehi-
cles, is among these vehicle handling systems
(upper right quadrant). A further develop-
ment of this system aims to relieve the bur-
den on the driver in slow-moving congested
traffic – first by braking the vehicle to a
complete stop, and then by moving it for-
ward again at low speed (ACC LSF: ACC low
speed following). 

A later stage of development aims to uti-
lize interaction between a number of differ-

4

Vehicle all-around visibility, detection range of sensors

ent sensors to enable complete linear control
even in city areas (ACC Stop & Go) and at
high vehicle speeds. The basis for this is a
complex fusion of radar and video data.
By combining the linear control system
with a (similarly video-based) lateral
control (lane-following assistance) system,
an autonomous vehicle handling system is
conceivable in theory. The lane-following
 assistance system is a further development
of the lane-changing alarm.

The active safety functions (top left quadrant
of diagram) encompass all features intended
to prevent accidents. The high demands
placed on them regarding functionality and
reliability extend from the simple parking as-
sistance brake, which automatically brakes the
vehicle before it hits an obstruction, to com-
puter-aided driving maneuvers for the pur-
pose of avoiding collisions. Intermediate
stages are represented by “predictive safety
systems” (PSS). They extend from pre-pres-
surizing the brakes when a potential hazard is
detected, to brief sharp application of the
brakes, through to automatic emergency brak-
ing, which always triggers full braking force if
the vehicle computer detects that a collision is
unavoidable. 

Comfort and convenience systems and
driver support systems (such as ParkPilot
and adaptive cruise control, or “ACC”) are
the foundations on which Bosch will be

 developing safety systems to full production
maturity over the next few years. In the
medium term the aim of these systems is to
reduce the severity of accidents, while the
longer-term objective is to prevent accidents
altogether.

Electronic all-around visibility

Using “electronic all-around visibility”,
 numerous driving assistance systems are
achievable – both for warning and for active
intervention purposes. Fig. 4 shows the pro-
tection areas covered by present and future
all-around visibility sensors.

Close range
Due to the limited availability of sensors,
only a few driving assistance systems have
been able to become established on the mar-
ketplace so far. One of them is “ParkPilot”,
which uses ultrasound technology to moni-
tor the close-range area. Ultrasound sensors
integrated in the vehicle’s fenders ensure that
the driver is given an acoustic or optical
warning if the vehicle approaches an obstruc-
tion. The sensors have a range of ≤ 1.5 m. The
next (fourth) generation of ultrasonic sen-
sors will have a range of ≈ 2.5 m. These sen-
sors will then be suitable for the future, more
demanding, advanced functions of parking
space measurement and parking assistant.
The close-range system now in wide-
spread use has been well accepted by users
and is already standard equipment on some
models.

cally applies the brakes to maintain the dis-
tance previously specified by the driver. As
soon as the scanned area is clear of vehicles,
ACC accelerates the vehicle again up to the
preset cruising speed. In this way, the vehicle
integrates harmoniously within the traffic
flow. It not only allows the driver to reach
his/her destination in a more relaxed state, it
also increases the level of attention that can
be devoted to traffic conditions. The ACC
data can also be used to warn the driver if
the  vehicle is approaching too close to the
 vehicle in front.

The current Bosch ACC version meets these
requirements by automatically intervening
in the braking and engine management 
systems at speeds of > 30 km/h. At lower
speeds, the system is deactivated.

The second generation (ACC2, beginning
in 2004) features a doubling of the horizon-
tal scanning range to ± 8° and a substantial
reduction in size. The device is thus the
smallest radar distance control system with
integrated ECU.

ACC is the first driving assistance system
which not only warns the driver but also 
actively intervenes in vehicle dynamics. 
The current version of ACC is designed par-
ticularly for use on expressways. Due to its
larger beam width, ACC2 will be able to as-
sess the traffic situation better, in particular
when negotiating curves or filtering in, and
will also be usable on highways with tight
curves. 

Long range
For long-range applications, ACC systems
with long-range radar (LRR) sensors are
 already in use. They have an operating fre-
quency of 76.5 GHz and a range of ≈ 120 m.
A very narrow-beam radar lobe scans the
area in front of the vehicle in order to deter-
mine the distance to the vehicle in front.
The driver specifies the required speed and
safety distance. If a slow-moving vehicle is
detected in front by the sensors scanning the
vehicle’s surroundings, the ACC automati-

Virtual safety shield
Ultrasonic sensors with extended scanning
range or short-range sensors can form a
“virtual safety shield” around the vehicle.
This shield can be used to implement a
number of functions. Firstly, the signals
from this safety shield warn the driver of
 potentially dangerous situations; secondly,
it acts as a data source for safety, comfort
and convenience systems. Even the driver’s
“blind spot” can be monitored by these
 sensors.

Driving assistance systems

Electronic all-around visibility

Video sensors
Video sensors play a major role in driving
assistance systems because they specifically
assist with the interpretation of visual infor-
mation (object classification, Fig. 5). In the
near future, Bosch will be able to offer this
type of sensor for use in vehicles. This will
open the way for a wide range of new
 functions. 

Rear-end video sensors (in their simplest

form) can assist the ultrasound-based
ParkPilot system during parking maneuvers. 
Greater benefit is offered by a rear-end
camera if the detected objects can be inter-
preted by image-processing software and the
driver is alerted in critical situations. Such a
situation might be one where an intended
lane change would be dangerous because a
vehicle is approaching fast in the outside
lane. 

The use of a front-end camera is necessary
to implement functions for night vision en-
hancement, for instance. To this end, the sys-
tem illuminates the road ahead of the vehi-
cle with infrared light. A display shows the
image recorded by an infrared-sensitive
camera. Visibility is enhanced for the driver
without dazzling oncoming vehicles, and
obstructions and hazards can be identified
more quickly in the dark.

A day-and-night sensitive front-end camera

allows several assistance functions. For ex-
ample, Bosch is currently developing sys-
tems for lane detection and road sign recog-
nition based on this technology. 

The “lane detection system” can identify
the lane boundaries and the lane direction
ahead. If the vehicle is about to move out of
its lane unintentionally, the system alerts the
driver. At a later stage, Bosch is planning to
expand lane detection into a lane-following
assistance system which can move the vehicle
back to its lane by actively turning the steer-
ing wheel. Combined with ACC, this will
make an ideal system for relieving driver
stress in stop-and-go traffic. 

Another function that makes use of data
from the video sensor is “road sign recogni-
tion”. This system is capable of recognizing
(“reading”) road signs (e.g. speed limit or
no-overtaking signs). The instrument clus-
ter then displays the last road signs recog-
nized.The front-end camera also assists the
ACC sensor by providing the capability of
not only measuring the distance from an
object, but of classifying it as well. By com-
bining the video system with long-range
radar, there are synergetic benefits: the
 visible range of the ACC is extended signifi-
cantly, and object detection is even more
 reliable. 

Video technology will initially be used in
driving assistance systems that provide in-
formation. Current video sensors are still a
long way from imitating the capabilities of
the human eye in terms of resolution, sensi-
tivity and light intensity response. However,
advanced methods of image processing
combined with recently developed dynamic
imaging sensors already demonstrate the
enormous potential of these sensors.

CMOS technology with nonlinear lumi-
nance conversion will be capable of cover-
ing a very wide range of brightness dynam-
ics and will be far superior to conventional
CCD sensors. Since the brightness of im-
ages in the automotive environment is not
controllable, the dynamic range of conven-
tional imaging sensors is inadequate; for
this reason, highly dynamic imagers are
 required.

The video signals from the camera in a
video system are transmitted to an image
processor which extracts individual image
features (Fig. 5). This information can also
be sent over a data bus to other ECUs or in-
formation units (HMI: human machine in-
terface), where it can be used as the basis for
initiating intervention in vehicle control or
for driver information.

Sensor data fusion
To ensure that assistance functions are as re-
sistant to fault as possible but remain capa-
ble of detecting and classifying several ob-
jects simultaneously, the signals of multiple
sensors must be combined and analyzed.
Sensor data fusion allows systems to create
an overall, realistic picture of the vehicle’s
surroundings. In this way, information
about the vehicle’s surroundings is much
more reliable than if it was detected by indi-
vidual sensors.

Future driving assistance systems will 
incorporate the functions of an increasing
number of sensors and actuators and will
have more complex connections to other 
vehicle systems. Bosch is developing all the
components and functions based on the
“Cartronic” system architecture, which
serves to network all control and regulation
tasks in the vehicle. It consists of a clearly
structured function architecture and modu-
lar software with open, standardized inter-
faces.

Summary and outlook 
The development of sensors for detecting
the vehicle’s surroundings is progressing at a
fast pace. New functions are quickly being
integrated according to their relevance to
safety and convenience. 

Close-range sensors represent the next
milestone in this development. They will
form a “virtual safety shield” around the ve-
hicle and provide the signals that will firstly
alert the driver to potentially critical situa-
tions, and secondly act as a data source for
active safety, comfort and convenience sys-
tems. At the same time (and as the high-
performance sensor chips become available
for volume production), video sensors will
enter the world of automotive technology
and open up a multiplicity of opportunities.
This will open up the way for information
systems that are based on highly complex
image analysis using high-performance
processors and which can be used as data
sources by several driving assistance
 systems.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

System overview

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC (Adaptive cruise control) simplifies
the task of driving a car because it relieves
the driver of the mentally demanding task
of keeping a check on the car’s speed, thus
allowing driving behind slower vehicles to
be relaxed and safe. 

System overview

Benefits and application area
It is that “following slower vehicles” function
of ACC in particular that is perceived by the
driver as a major gain in convenience and as
a substantial mental relief. The side effects 
of this function also include improved road
safety due to greater distances between
 vehicles and greater relaxation on the part
of the driver.

The main area of application for ACC
(Fig. 1) is on expressways and multilane
trunk roads with light to relatively high traf-
fic densities. Although use of the system in
 traffic jams and urban conditions is highly
desirable, at present this remains an objective
for future systems, as the technical difficulties
 associated with such a function demand
 considerable further development of sensor
capabilities (refer to the chapter on “Future
Developments”).

1

Adaptive cruise control (ACC) from Bosch

Function
For every adaptive cruise control (ACC) sys-
tem, the minimum function is cruise control
function, namely keeping the speed constant
at the setting selected by the driver. That
function, referred to below as Set Speed
Control, is employed primarily when there 
is no vehicle in front forcing the driver to
adopt a slower speed than the set speed.
Thus it is also effective if the car in front 
of the car with ACC is traveling faster.

The essential difference in function be-
tween ACC and standard cruise control is
that a car with ACC will safely follow a 
vehicle that is traveling at a slower speed
than the cruising speed to which the driver
has set the ACC (Fig. 2). 

If the vehicle in front is traveling at a con-
stant speed, a car fitted with ACC will follow
it at the same speed and a virtually constant
distance. That is because the distance be-
tween the two vehicles is – at least within a
broad speed range – virtually proportional
to their speed. This “constant time gap” is
(regardless of speed) equal to the time re-
quired for the most forward point on the car
with ACC to reach the current position of
the rearmost point on the vehicle in front. 
The changeover between these two main
functions is automatic without the need for
driver intervention. If the situation should

torque control, such as Motronic with
ETC (gasoline engine) or EDC (diesel
 engine) and

(cid:0) Electronic brake modulation with active

pressure build-up (generally based on the
electronic stability program, ESP).

So that ACC functions reliably (even in
curves) ESP provides, in addition to the de-
celeration capacity, important sensor signals
for variables related to vehicle dynamics.
Furthermore, for complete driving comfort,
ACC should ideally be combined with an
automatic transmission.

Special switches for control and display
allow the driver to activate the function and
set both the desired speed and the desired
time gap. The instrument cluster then
 displays the set values and additional ACC
information. 

change, for example because another vehicle
veers in or out and thus becomes the rele-
vant object being followed, this changeover
is also automatic and requires no driver
 intervention. 

The ACC system adjusts the speed by elec-
tronically accelerating, within certain limits,
via the engine management system or elec-
tronically activates the brake system for
braking deceleration.

Components
The system needs a ranging sensor to detect
vehicles driving ahead and to measure the
distance and speed of these vehicles. In
 Europe, a millimeter wave radar (frequently
called a microwave radar) is used for this
purpose. The sensor function and controller
logic are built into a single unit which, for
this reason, is called the “ACC sensor &
 control unit” (ACC-SCU).

The increased range and wider detection an-
gle of the second generation were a further
improvement to the function of ACC.

Existing subsystems, modified for ACC,

are used to change and control the speed

Physical measuring principles

Reflection
The radar (radio detecting and ranging)
transmits an electronic wave using an
 antenna. This wave bounces off of an object
in the radar beam’s path, returns and is
 received.

Radar echoes are generated by all electri-
cally conductive materials, particularly by all
vehicles that make up road traffic. There-
fore, radar is especially well suited as a dis-
tance measuring principle. Furthermore,
radar offers advantages in unfavorable
weather conditions (such as fog or rain)
 because it uses a longer wavelength than
 optical methods.

gation time measurement for the time be-
tween when the radar signal is transmitted
and when the signal echo is received. With
direct reflection, this time τ is equal to
(twice) the distance d to the reflector and
the speed of light c:

τ = 2d/c
For a distance of d = 150 m and 
c ≈ 300,000 km/s, the propagation time for 
τ ≈ 1.0 µs.

Doppler effect
For an object moving relative to the radar
sensor with a relative speed υrel, the signal
echo undergoes a frequency shift fD com-
pared to the emitted signal. For the differen-
tial speeds listed here, this shift is (Fig. 1):

Other distance measuring principles

fD = –2fC · υrel/c

(such as optical distance measuring devices)
require surfaces with good reflective proper-
ties. Objects with optical reflectors that are
dirty or not readily visible cannot be reliably
detected.

where

fC Carrier frequency of the signal

At the radar frequencies commonly 
used for ACC, fC = 76.5 GHz, there is a 
frequency shift of fD ≈ –510 · υrel/m, and
thus 510 Hz at a  relative speed of –1 m/s 
(proximity).

Propagation time measurement
For all radar methods, the distance measure-
ment is based on a direct or indirect propa-

Frequency modulation
Direct propagation time measurement re-
quires much effort; therefore, in most cases,
indirect propagation time measurement is
used. One of these methods is known as
FMCW (frequency modulated continuous
wave). Rather than comparing the times be-
tween the transmitted signal and received
echo, the FMCW radar compares the fre-
quencies of the transmitted signal and re-
ceived echo. The prerequisite for a meaning-
ful measurement is a modulated transmit
frequency.

For this purpose, the transmit frequency is
modulated using a VCO (voltage controlled
oscillator) in a linear ramp form with the gra-
dient m = df/dt (Fig. 2a). While the received
signal returns after the propagation time 
τ = 2d/c, the transmit frequency has changed
in the meantime by the differential frequency
fD = τ · m. Therefore, the propagation time,
and thus the distance, can be measured indi-
rectly by ascertaining the differential fre-
quency between the transmitted and received
signals. The differential frequency, in turn,
can be ascertained using a mixer, followed 
by low-pass filtering. To determine the fre-
quency, the signal is digitized and converted
into a frequency spectrum using an FFT (fast
Fourier transform). A peak in the spectrum
at fD (Fig. 2b) corresponds to a distance of 

d = fD · c/2m

However, the differential frequency infor -
mation contains not only the propagation
time information, but also the Doppler shift,
which results from the frequency difference
caused by the propagation time: ftot 1 = 
fD – ∆f. This means that there will, at first,
be ambiguity in evaluation. In addition to a
single differential frequency, a linear combi-
nation of distance and relative speed values
must be considered, which form a straight
line in the diagram “distance” as a function
of “relative speed” (Fig. 2c).

This ambiguity can be resolved by applying
multiple FMCW modulation cycles with
 different gradients.

When the transmit frequency is modulated
with a different ramp gradient, there is also
an ambiguity between “distance” and “rela-
tive speed”. However, in the diagram “dis-
tance” as a function of “relative speed”
mentioned previously, this ambiguity
 expresses itself in the form of another
straight line. 

If, for example, a mirror image of the first
ramp with negative gradient is used, the
 relationship shown in Fig. 3a results.
 According to this, a negative gradient leads
to a negative addition of the Doppler shift
∆f to the differential frequency shifted by
the propagation time fD (Fig. 3b). 

In the diagram “distance” as a function of
“relative speed”, the straight line for the neg-
ative ramp now intersects the straight line
that belongs to the first ramp with a positive
gradient. The intersection of the two
straight lines now provides the correct value
for the “distance” and the “relative speed”
(Fig. 3c).

However, the method must also be able to be
used if there is more than one target. To do
so, the method must be expanded by adding
more modulation cycles so that an unam-
biguous assignment of “target frequencies”
to “objects” is possible.

Determining the angle
To determine the angle at which the radar
locates an object, multiple radar “lobes” are
transmitted and evaluated.

Each radar beam has a characteristic “an-
tenna diagram”. For a defined target, the am-
plitude of the signal echo depends charac-
teristically on the angle at which the radar
hits the target (Fig. 4).

radar lobes. The quality of the amplitude
comparison depends on the overlapping
area of the individual antenna diagrams
(Fig. 4a).

To “illuminate” an angle range of 8°, three

radar lobes arranged in parallel with a full
width at half maximum of +/– 2° are used
(Fig. 4b).

Radar modules

Function
The actual measuring unit of the ACC-SCU
is the radar transceiver(RTC).
It has the following tasks:

(cid:0) Generating high-frequency radar radia-

tion in the 76-77 GHz range

(cid:0) Dividing and emitting three radar beam

lobes simultaneously

(cid:0) Subsequently receiving the echoes of this

radiation reflected by objects

(cid:0) Preparing these echoes for the down-

stream digital electronic signal processing

In addition, an electronic circuit is included
for highly accurate stabilization of the trans-
mit frequency and for generating a linear
frequency modulation.

A Bosch radar unit has the following specifi-
cations (Table 1):

On the other hand, the reflective properties
for a located target are unknown. There-
fore, no direct conclusion can be made as
to the angle of incidence of the wave from
the information provided by the radar
beam.

On the contrary, these prerequisites are met
when multiple radar lobes are used. Be-
cause the antenna diagram of each lobe is
sensitive in a different angle range, a con-
clusion as to the angle of incidence of the
wave can be drawn by comparing the am-
plitudes for a signal echo in the various

Gunn oscillator
The heart of the oscillator (Fig. 7) is an elec-
tronic semiconductor component that con-
sists of gallium arsenide and which,  because
of its doping, has the property of generating
electromagnetic oscillations at a very high
frequency when direct current is applied. 
The component is called the “Gunn
diode”, named after American physicist 
I. G. Gunn. In 1963, Gunn discovered the ef-

fect that in certain semiconductors (gallium
arsenide), oscillations in the microwave
range occurred at large electric field
strengths. The Gunn diode is packaged in a
ceramic housing and built into an oscillator
block consisting of aluminum.

The contact pin to the power supply contains
filter structures and a resonator disk which,
together with the rectangular inner cross sec-
tion of the block, forms a hollow resonator.
The oscillating behavior of the diode is, in
large part, determined by the geometric di-
mensions of the components surrounding it.
These facts place extremely high demands on
the precision with which these components
are manufactured.

The frequency can be varied within the
range of 76-77 GHz by modifying the applied
voltage (hence the technical name VCO: 
voltage controlled oscillator). The high-fre-
quency energy generated is fed to a distribu-
tion network via a rectangular hollow con-
ductor integrated into the oscillator block.

Distribution network and antenna feed
The distribution network (Fig. 8) is an elec-
trical stripline circuit realized using gold
striplines on a piece of fused quartz, which
has a thickness of 0.17 mm.

First, a small portion of the power trans-

ferred from the oscillator is separated and
fed to the frequency controller described
 below. Then, the energy is distributed to
three (or, for the second generation, four)
separate transceiver branches with identical
structure. Each of these branches contains a
double-ring structure and terminates in a
rectangular element called the antenna
patch, each of which has the function of
emitting and receiving one radar beam lobe.
Attached to the antenna patches are ele-
ments made of dielectric material that pre-
focus the emitted energy and beam it to an
antenna lens which, in a way similar to an
optical lens, causes the radar radiation to
 focus sharply into three superimposed
cones, each with an aperture angle of
 approx. 4° (8° for second generation ACC).

Greater  focusing would be possible only
with larger antenna lenses. Because any two
beam cones are approximately half superim-
posed, the total scanning range is 8° ((cid:0)± 4°)
or 16° for second generation ACC, beginning
at the  installation point of the radar at the
front of the vehicle.

The Bosch system is a monostatic radar sys-
tem, meaning that it also uses the same an-
tenna arrangement in the opposite direction
to receive the radar echo. A system of this
type needs less installation space than a
bistatic system with separate arrangements.
Thus it is better suited to installation in
 vehicles.

Mixer
The first ring structure of the distribution
network separates the power fed to it so that
the antenna patches (Fig. 9) receive only
about half of the power. The other half is fed
to a second ring structure. Simultaneously,
the energy received by the antenna patches
as radar echo is also conducted there. 

Each second ring structure of the distribu-

tion network forms, together with the an-
tiparallel switched diodes, makes up a mixer
in which the transmission and reception
power are combined into a single electrical
signal. The frequency of this signal corre-
sponds to the difference between the emitted
and received frequencies.

This electrical signal is the actual useful
radar signal. Its frequency, in the range from
20-200 kHz, contains the information about
the distance in the longitudinal direction
and the relative speed of the detected ob-
jects. The differences in amplitude of the
three branches are used to determine the
 angle.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Ranging radar

12.65 GHz, and which has the structure of a
DRO (dielectric resonator oscillator). This is
an electronic oscillator circuit consisting of a
power transistor and a dielectric resonator
element for frequency stabilization (like
quartz clock circuits, this oscillator is highly
stable with regard to service life and temper-
ature).

The energy of the DRO is fed to a “har-
monic mixer” located on the distribution
network. There it is mixed, at six times its
basic frequency (6 · 12.65 = 75.9 GHz), with
a small portion of the power taken from the
main oscillator, resulting in mixed frequen-
cies from 100-1100 MHz.

This signal is the input variable for the elec-
tronic frequency control. After being split
again (the frequencies are still too high for
further processing with standard electron-
ics), it is fed to a “discriminator” and con-
verted to a voltage proportional to the fre-
quency. The difference from the setpoint
value, which is also in the form of a voltage,
is measured. In case of deviations, the sup-
ply voltage of the oscillator is modified until
the setpoint value is again reached.

The setpoint value itself is a changing
variable. The signal processing unit sets this
variable to attain the change of the transmit
frequency of 200 MHz during one millisec-
ond; this change is required for the measure-
ment.

Furthermore, fixed, programmed maximum
and minimum values ensure that even if the
frequency control fails, the frequency cannot
leave the permitted range. 

The electronic circuit of the radar trans-
ceiver receives the useful signals over two
signal lines each.

Preamplifier
The total transmission power of the ACC
radar is only about 1 mW. Therefore, the
electric voltages of the useful signal are so
small that before it is processed further, the
signal must be amplified by a factor of sev-
eral million in a specially designed, three-
channel, integrated amplifier circuit. 

The frequency-dependent amplification
curve of the amplifier circuit ensures accu-
rate processing of echo signals, even from
faraway objects.

Echoes from faraway objects return higher
mixed frequencies and low voltage ampli-
tudes, as the more distant the reflecting
 object is, the less radar radiation is received.
Therefore, these echoes must be amplified
even more.

Frequency control electronics
Because all important information is con-
tained in the frequency of the useful signal,
fluctuations of the transmission frequency
would falsify measurement results, as would
deviations from the time linearity of the
transmitted frequency ramp.

The Bosch ACC radar is thus equipped with
fast frequency control electronics which,
 approximately every millionth of a second,
compare the emitted frequency with the
current setpoint value and adjust it accord-
ingly.

This also ensures conformity with legal
and/or telecommunications regulations,
which prescribe the frequency range from
frequency range from 76-77 GHz for
 operation of long-range automotive radar
systems.

To do this, in addition to the main oscilla-
tor, another oscillator is included as a refer-
ence oscillator with a rated frequency of

Requirements
The installation point for the radar sensor
portion of the ACC electronics is, of neces-
sity, the front area of the vehicle. This results
in the following requirements:
(cid:0) Temperature-resistant in a range from

–40 °C to ≥ +80 °C 

(cid:0) Tightly sealed against splash water and

steam jet

(cid:0) Resistant to vehicle vibrations in rough

road conditions

(cid:0) Resistant to stone impact
(cid:0) Smallest possible dimensions.

Furthermore, it must also be possible to
 adjust the radar sensor, as a highly accurate
match of the center position of the radar
beam cone with the center axle of the
vehicle is required for drivability during
ACC  control.

Components
The Bosch ACC electronics unit (Fig. 1)
contains not only the actual radar sensor,
but also all of the electronics necessary for
vehicle control. Therefore, it is called the
ACC-SCU (ACC sensor and control unit).

This unit does not require an extra installa-
tion space or extra effort for wiring, as all
signals of the ACC control are exchanged
over the vehicle data bus (CAN) with the
 engine and brake electronics and the gauge.

Lens
Generally, two essential physical parameters
determine the size of the radar devices
 (Fig. 2): 
(cid:0) The outer dimensions of the antenna

 system 

(cid:0) The associated focal length, i. e. the

 distance between the beam source and the
bottom of the lens.

For a given frequency, the diameter of a lens
results from the desired beam focusing. The
most complete illumination of the lens pos-
sible can be attained only if the distance be-
tween the beam source and lens is correct.

The lens of the Bosch radar is made of a
 special dielectric plastic that is temperature
resistant and resistant to stone impact.
It is part of the plastic top section of the
housing, which is thus tightly sealed to the
outside.

Optionally, an electric heater can be inte-
grated into the lens to prevent malfunctions
as a result of being coated with ice and snow
(wet snow, in particular, causes a noticeable
damping of radar beams).

Electronic components
The basic electronics of the ACC-SCU con-
sist of three printed circuit boards and the
radar transceiver unit (Fig. 2 and 3):

Radar transceiver unit 
The radar transceiver unit is placed directly
on printed circuit board 1 with short con-

Printed circuit board 1 contains all of the

cessing (calculating positions and speeds
from raw radar data). At its heart is a digital
signal processor. 

Printed circuit board 2
In addition to another processor (16-bit

cuit board 2 has a voltage regulator and ad-
ditional switching and control components.

tion to the vehicle electrical system and the
vehicle CAN bus, as well as interference sup-
pression chokes and capacitors.

Due to the integrated connections, all
three conductors form one electrical unit.
These flexible connections allow the entire
printed circuit board assembly to be folded
and thus arranged in a space-saving way in
the overall unit (Fig. 4).

Housing and adjustment device
The Bosch radar sensor controller unit has 
a die cast aluminum housing. The way in
which the electronic printed circuit boards
are installed in the housing ensures opti-
mum dissipation of heat losses.

On the outside of the housing, three pivot
eyes with plastic ball joint shells as fastening
elements. They hold three ball head screws
with threads that grip the plastic elements
of the holder.

These screws are arranged at an angle
 
that allows the unit to pivot in two levels
(Fig. 5). In a vertical direction, this occurs by
turning on screw 1 (the x-axis is the pivot
axis) and in a horizontal direction by turn-
ing on screw 3 (the y-axis is the pivot axis).
Here, screw 2 serves as the fixed bearing and
does not move.

To compensate for any inaccuracy in instal-
lation, this fixture allows the unit to be
 adjusted in the vehicle in a way similar to
a headlight. The holder is adapted to the
specific vehicle, and there are also versions
with angular gears for installation positions
in which the adjusting screws cannot be
 accessed from the front.

Adjustment
The adjustment is made in two steps:
(cid:0) Determining the longitudinal axis of the

vehicle (driving axis)

(cid:0) Aligning the radar axis parallel to the

 longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

is aligned to the vehicle axis, is very impor-
tant for the correct function of the ACC.

Horizontal misalignment can impair loca-
tion of the target, because this in particular
causes the angle determination of vehicles
driving ahead to be misinterpreted. As a
 result, the proximity behavior would be
 diminished, possibly causing a vehicle in a
neighboring lane to be selected as the target
object.

Vertical misalignment of the sensor can
negatively affect the sensor range and cause
errors in determining the angle. 

The requirements for the accuracy of the
alignment are determined by the lane pre-
diction, angle evaluation and plausibility
 algorithms (calculation processes). Mis-
alignment of the sensor has the same effect
on these functional components as an offset
error. When the horizontal misalignment is
about 0.3° or more, the impaired function
becomes noticeable to the driver. Therefore,
the required alignment accuracy should be
significantly less than this value.

Design and operating concept
The digital electronics (Fig. 7) can be di-
vided into the RPU (regulation processing
unit) and the SPU (signal processing unit).

The heart of the SPU is a DSP (digital signal
processor). This highly integrated electronic
component was originally used in car audio
applications. It is exceptionally well suited to
carry out many arithmetic operations (such
as multiplication and division) quickly. Thus
it is the ideal component to perform the
necessary calculations of detection, distance,
speed, angle and tracking. 

For the arithmetic operations just men-
tioned, the signals must be made available 
in digital form. This task is assumed by a
highly complex CC610 circuit. Bosch devel-
oped this circuit specifically for ACC signal
processing.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC sensor and control unit

An additional integrated DAC (digital-to-
analog converter) outputs a staircase-shaped
voltage ramp. It serves as the setpoint value
for the FLL regulation (frequency locked
loop, refer to the section on “Frequency con-
trol”) and generates a linear modulation of
the transmit frequency. While this voltage is
ramping up, the three mixed radar signals
are amplified by the preamplifier and digi-
tized with a resolution of 12 bits, filtered and
subjected to a FFT (fast Fourier transform).
The FFT allows the time signals to be con-
verted to frequency signals very quickly
(Fig. 8).

The DSP controls the chronological se-
quence of the modulation and retrieves the
results from the CC610 control circuit via
the parallel interface. The data are stored
temporarily in an SRAM with fast read/write
access. Once the two double ramps for fre-
quency modulation have been run through,
the arithmetic operations described else

where are carried out. The duration of one
cycle is 80-100 ms. The program required
for this sequence is stored in a separate SPU
Flash EEPROM. 

The objects with the attributes “distance”,

“speed”, “angle” etc. are transmitted to the
RPU via the serial interface. The function of
the RPU is described in a separate section.

The single-chip controller of the RPU con-
tains all switching modules such as the CPU
core, RAM, CAN controller, ADC (analog/
digital converter), counter, digital interfaces
to the EEPROM (programmable, non-
volatile read/write memory), the SPU, the
diagnosis module and the clock generating
oscillator. 

The program stored on an integrated flash

EEPROM can also be modified by the vehi-
cle manufacturer in the vehicle if additional
interfaces are provided.

The control function for the lens heater
activates the heating wire in the lens in cold
weather. Once the lens surface is heated, no
snow or ice can settle on it. Both ice and
snow can, to a certain extent, dampen the
radar beams and limit the intended range.
Although a monitoring function would 
ensure that the ACC function would be 
disabled in such a case, this would limit 
the availability of the system under these 
extreme ambient conditions. Pulse width
modulation allows the lens heater to be flex-
ibly activated depending on the temperature
and the supply voltage.

Voltage regulators
The digital and analog components need a
constant voltage supply in order to work
without errors. This is provided by several
voltage regulators. The battery voltage sup-
plied by the battery and generator would 
destroy the sensitive components. Due to 
the threat of malfunction, any voltage peaks
of ±100 V would have to be filtered out, as
would a superimposed alternating voltage 
of ±2 V. The ACC-SCU must also withstand
polarity reversal of the battery or starting of
the vehicle with a 24V car battery.

The division into two voltage regulators is

necessary to dissipate the heat loss gener-
ated. They supply the analog and digital
components of the RPU, SPU and RTC with
voltage.

The Gunn oscillator is supplied by an 8V
voltage regulator.

The analog/digital converters monitor the
voltages. If, for example, the measured sup-
ply voltage falls below a certain value, the
ACC function is no longer permitted. Like-
wise, the stabilized supply voltages that are
generated are tested for certain limit values.
In case of an error, the ACC function is
 disabled, a “disabled” message sent to the
display, and a fault code stored in the EEP-
ROM. 

The CAN interface module allows reliable
digital communication with the partner
ECUs in the vehicle. The CAN bus has be-
come established as the standard serial data
transfer method in motor vehicles. The
usual transfer rates are 250 to 500 Kbit/s. 
These high transfer rates require special
precautions to be taken. These include suit-
able filter components, which prevent inter-
ference from harmonic waves that could,
for example, impair radio reception in the
vehicle.

To allow diagnosis in the workshop, it is
necessary to store any faults that occur. An
EEPROM is installed in the ACC-SCU for
this purpose. Part of it is dedicated as fault
storage memory. In conjunction with a test
device, its contents can be read out and in-
terpreted for workshop diagnosis. In addi-
tion, the vehicle manufacturer can store
other typical data for the vehicle in the 
EEPROM.

The diagnosis module is the bidirectional
interface to the diagnostic tester. If the diag-
nostic tester sends the “read fault memory”
command, this message is interpreted by the
controller of the RPU. The controller reads
out the data from the EEPROM and con-
verts them into a protocol that the diagnos-
tic tester can understand. The diagnosis
module also has a protective function to
protect the sensitive controller from the
rough operating environment of the vehicle.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Composite system

System architecture
Purpose of the system architecture
Because ACC is a function that includes
multiple subsystems, the system architecture
plays a key role. Only with a suitable system
architecture can the subfunctions be linked
in a way that provides harmonious and re-
liable overall function. 

One particular challenge for the system
architecture is the fact that the participating
subsystems are often developed by different
suppliers – frequently, competitors – and
 sometimes vary even in the same vehicle
model.

Structure of the composite system
An overview of the basic structure of the
ACC control and integration of the system
into the vehicle is provided in Fig. 1 and 3 in
the “System overview” chapter. The ACC
sensor & control unit detects vehicles dri-
ving ahead and calculates a setpoint accele-
ration of the vehicle1). 

This setpoint acceleration is then converted
into suitable command signals for the part-
ner systems of the engine and braking system.
Therefore, the ACC system is not an autono-
mous system, but is based on networking of
the various participating partner systems.

Method of operation of the composite
 system
Fig. 1 provides an overview of the participa-
ting partner systems necessary for the over-
all function of ACC:
(cid:0) The ACC setpoint values for linear accele-
ration are implemented by the engine
 management and braking systems.
 Conversely, ACC needs information from
these partner systems about the status of
the vehicle, such as vehicle speed, vehicle
acceleration, rotational motion of the
 vehicle, current engine torque etc.

1) In this case, acceleration means the full range of
 accelerations – including negative acceleration – 
that cause vehicle deceleration.

(cid:0) The display and control elements can also
be accessed via CAN. ACC needs the dri-
ver command information (set speed, sel-
ected time gap) and provides information
to the driver (such as whether a target has
been detected). The control elements are
also needed by the conventional cruise
control and thus are usually evaluated by
the engine management system.

(cid:0) The transmission control is not used by

the ACC as an actuator system. However,
information from the transmission con-
trol is needed about the current force/
moment ratio of the transmission.

For data transmission, the CAN (controller
area network) control unit bus is used. This
network connects the individual systems.
Frequently, other devices are also connected
or can be reached via gateway functions. 

In addition to the type of data transmis-
sion, the convention of the data content of
the network signals is defined. This results
from the functional division. Therefore, the
content of the individual interface signals
can vary depending on the partner systems
present.

Traction control
The ACC system needs a way to intervene
into engine management in order to imple-
ment a setpoint torque command using the
engine management system. 

Most of the currently used engine mana-
gement systems offer this possibility (such
as EGAS systems, Motronic ME7, electronic
diesel engine control EDC). They use the
existing internal interface to the conventio-
nal cruise control. Thus it is possible to con-
trol the drive train based on engine torques
without knowledge of engine characteristic
fields.

Brake control
If the drag torque deceleration of the drive
train is no longer sufficient to implement
the setpoint deceleration requested by the
ACC control system, the active brake is trig-
gered. Two actuator versions are used for
this purpose:

Active brake boosters
A brake booster with electronically control-
led movement of the pedal linkage makes it
possible to brake automatically instead of
“manually” using the driver’s foot. The pre-
requisites for this are a suitable diaphragm
design and an additional pneumatic valve
with proportional control characteristics.
The brake light switch on the brake pedal
still controls the brake lights. An additional
“release switch” indicates when the driver
applies the brakes manually.

If there is a pressure sensor for pressure
measurement on the main cylinder outlet (as
is normally the case with the ESP vehicle dy-
namics control system), the active braking
for ACC is often controlled via a pressure or
torque interface.

Hydraulic brake actuators
In the TCS and ESP vehicle safety systems,
electronically controlled brake actuators are
already in widespread use – but only in
 situations where the vehicle’s stability is
threatened, not in normal driving conditi-
ons. With improved activation techniques,
the hydraulic actuators (generally, motor
pumps and valves) can be activated in a way
that also allows convenient brake activation. 

For the brake light activation, in addition to
the existing signal of the brake light switch
activated by the brake pedal, an additional
switching signal is generated, so that the
brake light is illuminated even for active
(automatic) braking. 

206

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Composite system

The braking system of the SBC (sensotronic
brake control) requires no additional hard-
ware whatsoever. As a “brake-by-wire” sy-
stem, SBC is ideal for ACC. The ACC request
is merely an additional setpoint branch for
this system.

Curve sensors
Familiar ACC systems use ESP sensor sig-
nals to measure the vehicle’s movement.
To do so, CAN typically transmits the mea-
sured quantities from an ESP control unit,
which is also in the vehicle, to the ACC
 control unit. In this way, the extra costs for
a sensor system exclusive to the ACC can be
avoided. 

The following ESP sensors are available for
ACC (the chapter on “Sensors” contains a
detailed description of the applications,
 design and method of operation of these
sensors):

Yaw rate sensors
The yaw rate sensors measure the rotational
motion of the vehicle around its vertical
axis. The physical measuring principle is
 based on the measurement of the Coriolis
force. Under the influence of a rotational
motion, there is a change of the translational
oscillation movement of a mass excited to
translational oscillation.

Steering wheel angle sensor
The physical measuring principle is based
on the angle measurement at the steering
column. Depending on the required task,
these sensors provide sliding contact or  
non-contact measurement. 

Acceleration sensor
The physical measuring principle is based
on measurement of the excursion of a mass
supported by elastic bearings when subjec-
ted to forces of inertia parallel or transverse
to the vehicle axis.

Wheel speed sensor
From the wheel speed sensor signals, the
corresponding ECU derives the wheels’ rota-
tion rates (wheel speed). The following types
of sensors are used for this purpose: 
(cid:0) Passive (inductive) speed sensors with a

gear connected to the wheel hub.

(cid:0) Active speed sensors with a multi-pole ring
on which magnets with opposite polarity
are arranged. Correspondingly, the mea-
suring element detects the change of the
magnetic flow.

Safety concept
Purpose of the safety concept
The objective of the ACC safety concept is to
avoid critical driving situations and driving
states in the event of errors of the ACC sy-
stem. At the same time, the limitations on
availability that originate from the safety
measures are to be minimized.

The safety concept must guarantee fail-
safe behavior of the ACC control unit and
allow accurate workshop diagnosis by doing
the following:
(cid:0) Shutting off the radar emissions
(cid:0) Disabling the ACC control system
(cid:0) Storing a fault memory entry.

Doing so requires reliable and differentiated
detection of all possible error states, and
 initiation of a fault response suited to the
specific type of fault.

Structure of the safety concept
Generally recognized methods for monito-
ring safety-related systems are diversity and
redundancy. 

In diversified information processing, all
calculations on a control computer of diffe-
rent types are reconstructed using different
software.

To achieve redundancy, twice the amount
of the same hardware and software is used.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

“Function monitoring” level
Likewise, the function monitoring level is im-
plemented into each of the two controllers
independently. Each controller carried out
tests of its own computational logic.

In addition, there are tests located outside

the ACC ECU that are executed by partner
ECUs. In this process, they check the ACC
messages for consistency and plausibility.
This detects faults of the ACC function that
lead to implausible CAN signals or an irre-
gular CAN transmission cycle. 

Examples of function monitoring are:
(cid:0) Internal hardware tests of the processor
(cid:0) Internal checksum tests of the processor
(cid:0) Testing of CAN checksums
(cid:0) Testing of CAN message counters
(cid:0) CAN timeout monitoring.

“Mutual control” level
The mutual control level includes the inter-
action of the two controllers in a shared
 monitoring structure. The primary diffe-
rence in contrast to the function monitoring
is that the monitoring and the function to
be monitored do not run on the same hard-
ware; rather, there is a mutual control
 between the two controllers. 

Examples of mutual control are:
(cid:0) Checksum testing of the internal

(cid:0) “Timing” monitoring of the internal

(cid:0) Calculation and mutual checking of

 communication

 communication

testing tasks.

With the increasing complexity of ECU
 functions in today’s vehicles, bit-accurate
matching of the results of diversified calcu-
lation methods is not attainable. Instead of a
simple query regarding consistency, a com-
plex plausibility algorithm must be develo-
ped that tolerates deviations within defined
 limits. However, complete error detection is
no longer provided in this case.

Furthermore, in the development of
ECUs, diversity and redundancy result in a
conflict of objectives with cost and size
 reduction. 

For these reasons, a monitoring concept
was developed for the ACC ECU that is based
on the computing structure specific to ACC
while, at the same time, taking into account
the complexity of the tasks and the specific
safety requirements. As a result, the ACC
ECU, with its dual-processor structure and
the associated internal communication,
meets the safety requirements with regard to
redundant hardware structures and monito-
ring units.

The monitoring concept of the ACC ECU

is divided into three logical levels that are 
located in the two controller units and in the
external partner ECUs:

“Component monitoring” level
The component monitoring level is composed
of two parts, which are independent of each
other, in the two controllers. It is limited to
the discovery of faults in the periphery of
the controller. No monitoring of the compu-
tational logic is associated with this. 

Examples of component monitoring are:

(cid:0) Monitoring the radar transceiver
(cid:0) Detecting misalignment of the sensor
(cid:0) Detecting “sensor blindness”
(cid:0) Monitoring the power supply
(cid:0) Monitoring the CAN data bus
(cid:0) Monitoring the lens heater.

208

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Composite system

In the case of an ACC error shutoff, the 
vehicle can continue to be used with no 
restrictions of other functions. The vehicle
does not need to be immediately brought
into the workshop for service.

In principle, there are only a few compo-
nents in the ACC ECU that can be detected
by only one monitoring function. In most
cases, depending on the nature of the
fault, various monitoring systems may be
activated. 

The following example demonstrates how
the monitoring levels complement each
other. Let us assume a fault in the power
supply for the controller units:

The component monitoring system provi-
des a voltage test for this purpose by feeding
the voltage into a monitoring path and com-
paring it to fault thresholds. However, this
requires that the controller to be monitored
still works correctly, despite the assumed
voltage deviation.

However, if the assumed fault leads to a
malfunction of one of the two controller
units, this can be detected by the mutual
control of the internal communication.

However, in this example the most likely
scenario is total failure of both controllers,
which will be detected by function monito-
ring in the partner ECUs as a CAN timeout.

Method of operation of the safety concept
The error messages of the individual moni-
toring functions are centrally evaluated in
the ECU. The fault response takes place in 
a differentiated manner according to the
 severity of the faults that occur and the
 momentary driving situation. 

The possible responses are as follows:
(cid:0) ACC control continues with no restric-
tions, no fault display, fault code storage
for workshop diagnosis

(cid:0) An ACC deceleration intervention ends,
followed by fault display and fault code
storage for workshop diagnosis

(cid:0) ACC control aborts immediately with
fault display and fault code storage for
workshop diagnosis.

Furthermore, a distinction is made between
reversible and irreversible faults:
(cid:0) Reversible faults disable the ACC control
for the duration of the fault detection
only

(cid:0) Irreversible faults disable the ACC control

for the duration of the driving cycle.

Therefore, in all fault events, ACC is again
available if no more faults are detected after
the next “ignition on”. The sole exception:
after misalignment of the sensor is detected,
the ACC function must be re-enabled in the
workshop.

Most entries into fault code storage for

workshop diagnosis fall into one of the
 following groups:
(cid:0) ECU faults (which require the ECU to be

replaced)

(cid:0) Deviations of the operating voltage
(cid:0) Overheating
(cid:0) Misalignment of the sensor
(cid:0) Hardware errors of the CAN bus
(cid:0) Errors in communication with the

(cid:0) Receiving an error signal from a partner

 partner ECUs

ECU.

History of radar

History of radar

Technology borrowed from the animal world
RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) is a
system that uses radio waves to locate distant
objects and is traditionally employed primarily
in aviation and shipping. It has also been widely
used for military applications since the devel-
opment of radar-assisted air defences in the
Second World War. More recent areas of ap-
plication include space exploration, weather
forecasting and, now, motor vehicles where it is
used to measure the distance between vehicles
for the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) system.

The idea for RADAR came from the sonar
(Sound Navigation and Ranging) system which
uses sound echoes to determine the distance
and position of objects, and which itself was
copied from the navigation techniques of certain
animals. Bats, for example, make high-pitched
sounds with frequencies in the ultrasonic range
of 30...120 kHz. The echoes that bounce back
off solid objects are picked up by the bat’s highly
sensitive ears. That information then helps the
bat to find its way around and to locate its prey.

RADAR functions in a similar manner but by
using radio signals instead of sound. Mea-
surement of distance by RADAR is based on
timing the interval between transmission of an
electromagnetic wave signal and reception of
the signal echo that is reflected back by an
object in its path. 

While radar systems used in aviation and ship -
ping operate at frequencies between 500 MHz
and 40 GHz, the frequency band approved for
ACC is 76...77 GHz.

Stages in the development of RADAR
The development of electromagnetic detecting
and ranging equipment with long-range capa-
bilities was an enormous challenge to the de-
signers. Only a minute part of the energy origi-
nally transmitted was reflected back by the tar-
get. For that reason a very high-energy signal
that is concentrated in as narrow a beam as
possible has to be produced. This demands
highly sensitive transmitters and receivers using
signals with a wavelength that is shorter than
the dimensions of the target.

The development of radar technology was
marked by the following milestones and per-
sonalities:
1837 Morse: The telegraph becomes widely

established. Here, electrical currents are
used for the first time in communicating
over longer distances.

1861/1876 Reis and Bell: Replacement of the

telegraph by the telephone provides a
much more direct and user-friendly method
of telecommunication

1864 Maxwell, Hertz and Marconi:

Existence of “radio waves” is theoretically
and experimentally confirmed. Radio
waves are reflected off metal objects in
precisely the same way as light is reflected
by a mirror.

1922 Marconi: The pioneer of radio provides 
the impetus for the continuation of earlier
research into radio ranging

1925 Appleton and Barnett: The principle of 
radio-wave reflection is used to demon-
strate the existence of conductive layers
in the atmosphere
Breit and Tuve: Development of pulse
modulation which enables precise
 measurement of distances
1935 Watson-Watt: Invention of radar
1938 Ponte: Invention of the magnetron 

(velocity-modulated electron tube for
generating high- frequency oscillations)

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Control and display

Control and display

Function
Control and display elements are the imme-
diate interface between the ACC system and
the driver. Operation and interpretation
should be as simple, unambiguous and
 intuitive as possible (i.e. an operation or
 situation should be able to be understood
immediately). 

Design and operating concept
Particularly for the control and display ele-
ments in the driver information area, a large
amount of design leeway exists that is used
differently by different vehicle manufactur-
ers (see Fig. 1 for an example). 

Therefore, the following describes the
 typical elements and their function without
necessarily reflecting any one particular
arrangement. Since controls are frequently
acknowledged by a display function, control
and display are grouped together in each case.

Activation
Although ACC is used frequently, it still
must be actively switched on by the driver.

In some vehicle models, it must first be en-
abled using a master switch. In other mod-
els, it is in a passive standby mode as soon
as the ignition key is in the “ignition on”
 position. 

The required conditions for activation
 include:
(cid:0) The driving speed is higher than the
 minimum desired cruising speed.
(cid:0) The brake pedal is not depressed.
(cid:0) The handbrake is released.
(cid:0) No faults are detected in the ACC-SCU 

or ACC system.

As soon as the requirements for activation
have been met and the driver presses a but-
ton provided for this purpose, ACC takes
 effect. 

An important prerequisite for beginning

this regulation is, of course, the desired
cruising speed and desired time gap, so that
the driver receives immediate feedback
about the configured desired settings and
can modify them if necessary. Therefore, it is
absolutely necessary for these values to be
displayed, at least at activation.

To clearly and unambiguously distinguish
ACC from other functions, the ISO (Inter-
national Organization for Standardization)
has defined a symbol for it (Fig. 2). This
symbol can be used both as a readiness indi-
cator and an activation indicator. 

Setting and display of the desired cruising
speed
All previously existing operating concepts
combine the activation and setting of the
desired cruising speed, meaning that as soon
as the driver uses the switch for setting the
desired cruising speed, ACC is also simulta-
neously activated out of standby mode
 (Fig. 3). 

Although frequently, the same switches are
used as for conventional cruise control, the
setting process is substantially different.
Specifically, real-world experience has
shown that drivers find it more useful to
have larger increments for ACC. For exam-
ple, instead of increments of approximately
1 km/h used for conventional cruise control,
increments of 5 or 10 km/h haven proven
useful for ACC. 

These larger increments make it easier to
adjust the desired cruising speed over wider
ranges, for example when changing from a
construction zone to “open-road” driving on
the expressway and vice versa. 

There are four functions for setting ACC: 

1. Accepting the actual speed as the desired

cruising speed (Set).

2. Accepting the next higher increment than

the actual speed (Set +).

3. Accepting the next lower increment than

the actual speed (Set –).

4. Accepting the stored desired cruising

speed (R Resume).

ping, in the increments mentioned above
(Step +)/(Step –). 

Step – with Set, Set – or with Resume

The display is integrated with the speedo -
meter (Fig. 4) or appears in a separate field
as a digital value. 

Setting the desired distance and desired
time gap
The desired distance and desired time gap
depend on personal preference, but also on
traffic and weather conditions. For this vari-
ation range, all manufacturers offer at least
three different settings in the range of 1.0 to
2.0 s (time gap). 

Various operating philosophies also exist for
this configuration option:
(cid:0) Continuous adjustment using a small

knob (Fig. 5a)

(cid:0) Step switch (Fig. 5b)
(cid:0) Button for stepping through a program
sequence, such as long, medium, short,
long, medium etc. (Fig. 5c).

When changing the time gap, the driver 
 receives feedback about the selected setting.
Fig. 6 shows two possibilities of how this can
be displayed. 

“Object detected” display
In addition to the absolutely necessary
 displays of the “desired cruising speed” and
“desired distance”, the “object detected”
 display has also proven useful. It informs
the driver when the ACC sensor has found
a relevant object (such as a car driving ahead
of it).

Other display functions
A display that the driver would rather not
see is the error message, which appears in
case of a function shutoff or failed activa-
tion. 

In addition to plain text messages, the ISO
symbol can also be used to display this 
message. 

In addition to “real” errors in the various
ECUs used in the ACC composite system,
temporary errors can also cause a shutoff. 

Specifically, if the sensor’s view is impaired,
for example by a thick coat of wet snow,
there is a shutoff with an indication of the
impairment. 

Deactivation
As with conventional cruise control, ACC is
deactivated by pressing an off button or us-
ing the brake pedal. Deactivation also occurs
in case of impermissible operational states
of the vehicle or if the vehicle falls below the
minimum control speed.

A partial deactivation takes place after inter-
ventions of the TCS or ESP slip control sys-
tems. In this case, only the brake is activated;
no acceleration takes place. This provides
the opportunity to finish a deceleration
 maneuver. To continue driving with ACC,
the driver must manually reactivate its full
functionality.

Detection and object selection

Detection and 
object  selection

Radar signal processing
Fourier transform
All objects located at the same time (such
as different vehicles) generate characteristic
parts of the signal, with frequencies that
 result from the distance and relative speed
and amplitudes that result from the reflec-
tive properties of these objects. All parts of
the signal are superimposed to create the
 received signal.

The analog-digital conversion of the re-
ceived signals is first followed by a spectral
analysis to determine the distance and rela-
tive speed of the objects. To do so, a power-
ful algorithm (calculation process) known as
FFT (fast Fourier transform) is used. It con-
verts a series of equidistant sampled time
signal values into a series of spectral power
density values, with equidistant frequency
intervals.

For the classic FFT algorithm, the number

must be a power of two (e.g. 512, 1024,
2048). 

The calculated spectrum has particularly
high power density values at those frequen-
cies assigned to the radar echoes. Further-
more, the signal includes noise signal com-
ponents generated in the sensor and super-
imposed over the useful signal of the target
objects. 

The spectral resolution is defined by the

number of sampling values and the sam-
pling rate.

Detection
Detection is the search for the characteristic
frequency signals of the radar objects. Due
to the wide variations in signal strength be-
tween the different objects, as well as of the
same object at different times, a special de-
tector is used. On the one hand, this detector
must find, wherever possible, all of the sig-
nal peaks that come from real objects. On
the other hand, it has to be insensitive to

those parts of the signal caused by back-
ground noise or interference signals. For  -
example, the noise signal generated in the
radar itself is not constant in the spectrum,
but depends on time and frequency. 

For each spectrum, a noise analysis is carried
out first. A threshold value curve is defined
depending on the spectral distribution of
the noise power. Only peak signal values that
are above this threshold are interpreted as
target frequencies. 

Object detection
Although the echo signals in the individual
modulation cycles contain the information
about the distance and relative speed of the
objects, they cannot be unambiguously as-
signed to the objects. Only by linking the
 detection results of the modulation cycles
can the results for distance and relative
speed of the objects be obtained.

A found target frequency is composed of
one part that depends on the distance and
one part that depends on the relative speed.
Therefore, to determine the distance and rel-
ative speed, target frequencies from multiple
modulation ramps must fit together. 

For the “multiple ramp FMCW measure-
ment principle” a target frequency must be
found for a physically existing radar object
in each modulation ramp. This target fre-
quency must be calculated from the distance
and relative speed of the object (refer to the
chapter on “Ranging radar”). 

The assignment is difficult when the
 spectra contain a large number of target
 frequencies.

The angle of a radar target to the axis of the
radar is calculated from the comparison of
the amplitude values for the same object in
three adjacent radar beams.

Tracking
Tracking compares the measured data of 
the currently detected objects with the data
from the previous measurement. 

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Detection and object selection

215

Object selection
To select the most significant objects, in a
first step, the lateral (sideways) position dyc
(course offset) relative the vehicle’s own pre-
dicted course is determined. As shown in
Fig. 1, it is calculated on the one hand from
the lateral offset dyv relative to the vehicle
axis. In doing so, the lateral offsets relative to
the sensor axis xS are transformed using the
sensor offset dySensor to the center axis of the
vehicle xF. 
On the other hand, using a description of
the predicted course dyvCourse = ky · d2/2 (e.g.
using a parabolic approach as approxima-
tion of a circular arc), we can calculate the
course offset for 

dyc = dyv – dyvCourse

1

Determining the lateral (sideways) object position 
dyc relative to the course (course offset)

An object which, at the last measurement,
was measured at the distance d with a rela-
tive speed υr, has continued to move in the
time ∆t between the previous measurement
and the new measurement and should now
be measured at the expected distance

de = d + υr · ∆t

Considering the fact that the measured ob-
ject can also accelerate or decelerate, there is
a margin of uncertainty regarding the dis-
tance de in which the newly measured dis-
tance value may be expected. 

If the new measurement does indeed find an
object within the expected range for distance
and relative speed, the conclusion can be
drawn that it is the same vehicle. Since the
previously measured object was again found
in the current measurement, the measured
data are filtered with consideration of the
“historical” measured data.

If, however, a previously measured object

is no longer found in the current measure-
ment (for example, because it is outside the
radar beam or generates too little signal
echo), the predicted object data continue to
be used.

Additional measures for object tracking are

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Detection and object selection

Thus the determination of dyc depends on
the type of description of the vehicle’s own
course, for which various methods exist.
Some of them are described in greater detail
below. 

In a second step, a lane probability “lp” is cal-
culated for each measuring cycle. This speci-
fies the probability with which the radar ob-
ject ahead is in the vehicle’s own lane. Here,
the vehicle’s own lane is described using
geometric principles that take into consider-
ation both the “lane width” and variables
such as “uncertainty of course definition”. 

The lane probability “lp” is the input vari-
able for the integral variable “plausibility” of
an object “plaus”. This variable is a ratio that
determines the relevance of the object de-
pending on the frequency and certainty of
the measurement. It also takes into account
characteristics of the sensors such as “accu-
racy of angle determination” and “detection
capability.”

If there is a positive lane probability for
the vehicle’s own lane, the variable “plaus”
(plausibility) can be based on it. However, if
the object in the current measurement is not
in the vehicle’s own lane or is not measured
at all, “plaus” is reduced.

The object can be selected as the target ob-
ject only if a minimum plausibility for the
vehicle’s own lane is ensured. Accordingly,
common ACC systems consider only moving
objects with the same direction of travel. Be-
cause of the risk of detection errors and the
current impossibility of object classification
(for example, whether it is a beverage can or
a stationary vehicle), ACC ignores stationary
objects. 

Course prediction
Control quality
Course prediction plays a decisive role in
 assigning the vehicles detected ahead to the
vehicle’s own course and thus has a particu-
larly great influence on the control quality of
ACC.

In the example shown in Fig. 2, a vehicle 
driving in the left lane in a stationary curve
with the curvilinear course A has an ACC
control system that homes in on object 1, a
vehicle driving ahead of it. The ACC vehicle
follows this vehicle as desired by the driver.
The straight course B, on the other hand,
mistakenly considers a slower object 2 in the
right-hand lane, for example just prior to a
curve. As a result, the driver of the ACC
 vehicle experiences an inconvenient and
 implausible deceleration of his or her own
vehicle. 

Therefore, to lessen the risk of incorrect
 object selection illustrated in this example,
reliable curve prediction is of great benefit. 

The basic variable for determining the
course is the “trajectory curvature”. It de-
scribes the change of direction of the ACC
vehicle as a function of the path the vehicle
has already driven. To determine the future

course, this information can be supple-
mented with the current and past positions
of moving or stationary objects.

Future ACC systems will use navigation sys-
tems and video systems with image process-
ing capabilities to determine the curvature. 

Determining the curvature
The curvature k describes the change of di-
rection of a vehicle as a function of the path
already traveled. It is calculated as follows:

R = 1/k

The curvature of the vehicle trajectory can
be determined by various sensors on the
 vehicle, but the prerequisite for all calcula-
tions is that they are used outside certain
limit ranges of vehicle dynamics. Therefore,
they do not apply to situations in which the
vehicle skids or a greater wheel slip occurs. 

To determine the course, currently available
ACC systems use an offset-corrected yaw
rate. This is obtained either directly from the
ESP system from the signals of the steering
wheel angle sensor, lateral acceleration sen-
sor, wheel speed sensor and yaw rate sensor
or determined by the ACC system itself
 using an offset correction. 

The yaw rate dψ/dt as the rotation of the
 vehicle around its vertical axis, describes the
current curvature ky as the driving trajectory
with the driving speed υx:

ky = (dψ/dt) / υx

Generally, the trajectory curvature is aver-
aged, for example using simple low-pass
 filtering.

ESP sensor data for calculating the curvature
Common ESP systems have, in addition to
the yaw rate sensor, three other sensors that
allow the following curvature calculation:

To calculate the curvature ks from the steer-
ing wheel angle δ, two other parameters are
required, the steering gear reduction ratio isg
and the wheelbase dax. These parameters al-
low a very good approximation of ks under
the typical conditions for ACC:

ks = δ /(isg · dax)

Also, to calculate the curvature ka from the
lateral acceleration ay, the driving speed υx is
used:

ka = ay/υx

2

To calculate the curvature kv from the wheel
speeds, the relative difference of the wheel
speeds ∆υ/υx and the lane width day are
needed. To keep influences from the drive to a
minimum, the difference ∆υ = (υl – υr) and
the driving speed are also measured on the
non-driven axis.

kv = ∆υ/(υx · day)

Although all of the specified methods can be
used to determine the curvature, not all are
equally well suited to different operating
conditions. They particularly differ in cross-
wind, banked roads, and tolerances of the
wheel radius and with regard to measure-
ment sensitivity in various speed ranges.
As Table 1 shows (grid), the curvature ky
from the yaw rate is the best suited for the
methods considered as a whole. 

However, there is a further increase in signal
quality if one or all signals are used for mu-
tual comparison. Specifically, this is possible
if the ACC is equipped with a vehicle
 dynamics control system (such as ESP).
Then, all of the sensors listed above are
 components of the system.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Detection and object selection

Curve prediction
For stretches of road with pronounced
changes in curvature (such as winding
stretches of expressway), a potentially incor-
rect object selection results from the ESP-
 assisted determination of the curvature,
which describes the vehicle’s current trajec-
tory. Using the following approaches, pre-
dictive determination of the curvature in a
given distance is, in principle, possible:

Prediction using radar data
There are two different methods in which
radar data could be used:
1. Analyzing the transverse movement of
 vehicles driving ahead and predicting a
curve based on that information. 

Here, a collective transverse movement of
multiple vehicles in front indicates that a
curve begins ahead. Corresponding misin-
terpretations caused by vehicles changing
lanes must be prevented.

2. Analyzing stationary objects on the 

roadside in order to describe the future
course of the road. 

Here, approximation methods can be used,
but in this case, objects located further from
the edge of the road must be reliably
 ignored. 

Navigation systems
Predictive curvature information in defined
intervals (of either time or distance) can, in
principle, be determined in advance if this
information is obtained based on digital
maps with data points along the road (data
points in the digitized road map) in incre-
ments of no more than 100 m. Here the
 curvature is calculated, for example, 50 m
before the beginning of a curve using inter-
polation methods with reference to the
 existing data points. 

Problems in this measuring principle are
caused by such things as inaccuracies in the
digital maps themselves or maps that do not
correspond to the current course of the
road. In the future, additional information
(such as the number of lanes or type of
road) will allow other applications.

Video image processing
A powerful but expensive method is lane
identification using a video camera and
 image processing. This technique was used
in the first ACC system on the Japanese
 market. Since then, however, no other ACC
systems have provided additional sensors
with video.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC control

ACC control

Controller structure
Fig. 1 is a diagram of the basic structure of
the ACC control system. Levels 1 through 3
have already been described in detail in the
chapter on “Detection on object selection”.
This chapter, “ACC control”, gives particular
emphasis to Levels 4 through 6 (Fig. 1): 

Level 1
In this top level of signal processing (func-
tion level), available physical variables are
first measured (e.g. frequencies, echo propa-
gation times, amplitudes etc.). 

ACC measures some of this sensor infor-
mation (such as radar data) itself and uses
some sensor values from external sensors
(such as values of the wheel speed sensors
of the electronic stability program ESP for
vehicle dynamics control).

Level 2
In this level (plausibility level), the physical
variables measured previously are processed
further, already related to the application in
the specific vehicle. This results in an initial
list of radar objects of interest for the ACC
control system with the attributes “distance”,
“relative speed” and “lateral position”. 

To determine the curvature of the course,
this level also evaluates the vehicle dynamics
sensors with regard to the “trajectory curva-
ture”.

Level 3
In this next processing step (control level),
the objective is to select, from the objects of
interest, the object that is meaningful for the
control system. This is normally the “target
vehicle”. In almost every case, this target ve-
hicle is the one directly ahead of the ACC
vehicle in the lane. Exceptions to this rule

occur primarily when either the vehicles
ahead or the ACC vehicle changes lane. For
such cases, it is advantageous to have a list
with more than one possible target object. 
The decision is then shifted to the next

level. For correct selection of the target 
vehicle(s), powerful “course prediction” and
good “tracking” is indispensable (refer also
to the “Detection and object selection”
 chapter). 

Level 4
After the target object is selected, the actual
ACC control takes place in this level. The
 result is a “vehicle setpoint acceleration”. 

If, according to the classification in Level 3,
more than one target vehicle remains in the
list, the control algorithms for multiple po-
tential target objects can be calculated and
subsequently evaluated. This processing step
can also include the vehicle speed control
and curve control.

Level 5
In level 5, the “vehicle setpoint acceleration”
output variable from the fourth processing
step is implemented by the longitudinal
control. To do so, the specific branch is first
selected that can set the desired acceleration.
For positive and slight negative accelera-
tions, this is the drive train. 

If the deceleration attained with the engine
drag torque is not sufficient, a switcher to
the deceleration control branch takes place,
which then makes use of active braking force
generation. 

In both branches, there is compensation for
disturbance values caused by changes of to-
tal running resistance (particularly due to
changing road gradients).

Level 6
This last level of processing steps is con-
cerned with the generation and modulation
of the wheel forces. In the drive branch, this
primarily affects the engine control, where a
modulation originating in the transmission
(drive train) is also possible. 

The deceleration is primarily caused by
pneumatic or hydraulic actuator systems.
They build up braking force actively, with 
no need for the driver to do anything (active
brake intervention). 

Controller functions
The ACC controller (Fig. 2, next page) in-
cludes the following controller functions 
described in detail below:
(cid:0) Cruise control
(cid:0) Tracking control
(cid:0) Curve control
(cid:0) Acceleration control.

The actuator signals are output to the actua-
tor systems via a torque or acceleration in-
terface.

Cruise control
The driver sets the desired vehicle speed us-
ing the control elements. Then, in the first
step, the control system calculates a setpoint
value for adjusting the current vehicle speed
until it is equal to the desired cruising speed.
It is important to note here that the speed
displayed by the gauge moves ahead of the
actual speed.

A byproduct of the display and operating

concept of current ACC systems is the fol-
lowing two situations in which there can be
(without the driver’s intention) a large dif-
ference between the current vehicle speed
and the desired set speed:
(cid:0) Resuming cruise control by pressing

 “Resume” (resume function) activates the
last set desired cruising speed as the cur-
rent desired cruising speed. In some cir-
cumstances, the driver can reach a much
higher speed than the set speed by simply
applying the gas pedal before pressing the
“Resume” button to resume ACC.

222

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC control

(cid:0) While ACC is operating, the driver can

disable the ACC control by depressing the
accelerator. Thus he or she can attain a
much higher speed than the set desired
cruising speed.

In both situations, the driver may not be
aware of the great difference between the
 actual and set speeds. The ACC vehicle
speed control system assists the driver in
these situations by means of a moderate
control response.

Tracking control
The second step selects the vehicle driving
ahead that is to be used for the measure-
ment. To do so, the object data are com-
pared to the geometry of the vehicle’s own
predicted (predefined) course. If more than

one vehicle is in the range of this predicted
course, usually the vehicle directly ahead is
used for the control system. 

Ideally, the vehicle selected is the one that
provides the lowest setpoint acceleration at
the controller output. However, this requires
a feedback loop linking the controller value
to the target vehicle selection. Once the target
vehicle is selected, a setpoint acceleration is
calculated based on the distance and relative
speed. The setpoint distance results from the
desired or setpoint time gap τSet set by the
driver:

dSet = τSet · υF

The setpoint time gap is usually in the range
from 1 to 2 seconds; the values tend to be
larger at slower speeds.

This range can be logically divided into
three steps so that the driver can be offered
three time gap settings: 
(cid:0) “Close” 
(cid:0) “Medium” 
(cid:0) “Far”
An example of these is illustrated in Fig. 3. 

(cid:0) The limited detection range of the sensor
in tight curves also leads to situations in
which the tracking control can no longer
detect a selected target vehicle. In this sit-
uation, the curve control of ACC prevents
the car from immediately accelerating
again.

The selection of the control parameters is a
compromise between optimizations in two
opposing directions:

The first optimization is the fastest possible
correction of the deviations from the set-
point defined by the relative speed υrel = 0
and the setpoint distance. 

The other optimization is for comfort
purposes, whereby the system is to react as
slowly as possible to small deviations of dis-
tance and changes in the speed of the vehicle
ahead. 

A nonlinear controller approach solves
this optimization problem by being more
sensitive to changes of relative speed than
changes of distance. The rule of thumb is
that a relative speed of 1 m/s triggers ap-
proximately the same setpoint acceleration
as a deviation of 5-10 m from the setpoint
distance.

Curve control
Although the ACC system was primarily de-
signed to be used on expressways (with rela-
tively large radii of curvature), it can also be
used on other winding roads. In this respect,
a few important features need to be consid-
ered:
(cid:0) As a comfort system, ACC must not sur-

prise the driver with uncomfortable linear
accelerations when driving through
curves. 

(cid:0) Due to the limited angle range of the

radar sensor (Fig. 4), ACC adapts the pos-
sible acceleration of the system to the lim-
ited detection range in tight curves.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC control

Selecting the control mode
The setpoint values for the tracking control,
desired cruising speed and curve control are
all calculated in parallel. The subsequent
minimum selection process processes the
setpoint values and ensures that an ACC
 vehicle never follows another vehicle at a
faster speed than the desired cruising speed
set by the driver.

Longitudinal control
The ACC controller calculates a setpoint
value based on accelerations. A separate
 acceleration control converts this setpoint
value into the actual vehicle acceleration.
To do so, the suitable branch of the actuator
system – specifically, the drive train or brak-
ing system – is selected depending on the
setpoint value and the current status. 

Then, these actuator systems calculate the
actuator setpoint values corresponding to
the acceleration setpoint value. 

The primary requirements for the longitudi-
nal control are: 
(cid:0) Smooth changeovers between drive and

brake (and vice versa)

(cid:0) Correction of disturbance values, particu-
larly for an uphill or downhill gradient

Interfaces to actuator systems
The simplest solution would be to pass on
the acceleration setpoint value of the ACC
controller directly to the actuator systems.
However, this requires a subordinate acceler-
ation control in the actuator systems that is
not available in all cases. 

In practice, there are primarily two inter-
faces:

Torque interface
Most engine management systems operate
based on engine torque. They handle ACC
in the same way as conventional cruise con-
trol. Therefore, only minor adaptations of
the engine management system are required
in order to implement an external setpoint
torque from ACC.

However, the setpoint acceleration must 
be converted into a setpoint torque within
ACC. To do so, it is necessary to calculate
the forces in the drive train and estimate the
uphill or downhill gradient of the road or
execute a subordinate torque control within
ACC.

The torque interface is useful only if an
 actuator can also reliably implement the
 required torque.

Acceleration interface
Most common braking systems (smart
booster, hydraulic braking intervention in
ESP, SBC) support the acceleration interface. 

Functional limits
Speed range
An ACC system is primarily intended for
 expressway and highway driving. The sen-
sors currently used for ACC only cover the
area of the vehicle’s own lane beginning at
an approximate distance of 40 m, with the
result that vehicles driving ahead cannot al-
ways be detected in city traffic and on roads
with tight curves. 

For this reason, the lower speed limit of

ACC systems (depending on the system
 design) is in the range from 30 to 50 km/h
(refer also to Fig. 4 on the previous page).

Because of the comfort design of common
ACC systems, the top speed limit is in the
range from 160 to 200 km/h.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC control

225

Longitudinal dynamics
Since an absolutely correct controller re-
sponse cannot be guaranteed, the effects of
the control (i.e. the vehicle acceleration and
deceleration) have to be kept within certain
limits. These limits can pertain to both the
absolute acceleration and to its change-over
time. 

While the upper acceleration limits pertain
to values that are also common with conven-
tional cruise control (approximately 0.6 to
1.0 m/s2), for ACC with active braking, there
is a fixed deceleration limit value of typically
2.5 m/s2. In many cases, this value is suffi-
cient for the speed change. Although the de-
celeration in this case is clearly noticeable to
the driver, it is still only one quarter of the
maximum possible deceleration on a dry
road. 

However, the limited deceleration capacity,
together with the equally limited range of
the radar sensor, results in a maximum dif-
ferential speed for which ACC is able to
compensate without the intervention of the
driver (Table 1). Though it would seem that
a larger range is needed so that reaction can
begin earlier, this is not feasible for the fol-
lowing reasons:
(cid:0) The accuracy for correct lane assignment

decreases significantly with increasing dis-
tance. 

(cid:0) The probability of a passing maneuver in-
creases at a higher differential speed and
can be confirmed only in the immediate
vicinity of the target object. 
This results in a conflict of objectives: 
on the one hand, an early reaction is nec-
essary at a high differential speed; on the
other hand, particularly in this case, the
likelihood of a passing maneuver is quite
high, making early braking deceleration
undesirable.

(cid:0) In case of a lane change of either the vehi-
cles driving ahead or the ACC vehicle, the
beginning of the reaction is defined not
only by a distance, but also by the begin-
ning of the object assignment to the vehi-
cle’s own lane. Thus during a lane change,
the driver must take into account the fact
that ACC cannot compensate for the
speed difference.

(cid:0) In curves with a radius of less than

1000 m, roadside objects and vehicles in
the adjacent lane can limit the detection
range of the ACC sensor with the result
that, although following is still possible
in the curve, the forward detection range
is not sufficient for an early reaction
when approaching a newly appearing
 vehicle.

Although a higher degree of precision is
possible in a few cases, this frequently is
at the cost of transparency and thus can
 diminish the ability for assessment by the
driver. 

Stationary objects
ACC is fundamentally capable of distin-
guishing between stationary and moving ob-
jects. The radar system measures the relative
speed υrel, j of an object, and the comparison
with the ACC vehicle’s own speed υF yields
the absolute speed υj of the object:

υj = υF + υrel, j

However, stationary objects are generally
 excluded by the ACC tracking control. 

There are two primary reasons for this:
(cid:0) ACC is a convenience system. Therefore,
its deceleration capacity ACC is not de-
signed to brake the vehicle in a timely
manner to avoid colliding with stationary
objects.

226

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

ACC control

(cid:0) It is currently technically impossible to

(cid:0) The sensors consider and evaluate station-

make a sufficiently accurate decision as to
whether or not an object is in the vehicle’s
own lane. Therefore, considering the large
number of stationary objects on the road-
side, it is highly probable that ACC would
react erroneously to such an object.

For these reasons, the Bosch ACC system
works according to the following strategy:

ary objects at low speeds only.

(cid:0) Only driving or stopped objects are con-
sidered for the tracking control. This
makes an erroneous deceleration due to a
stationary object on the roadside almost
impossible.

ing if it detects stationary objects in the
vehicle’s own lane.

Further developments

Sensors
Preparation for more widespread use of
ACC systems is in the foreground of further
development of ACC sensors. 

Components that could be produced in
large volumes, particularly for the high-fre-
quency circuitry of the radar sensors, were
until now primarily used in aviation, mili-
tary and radio link system applications and
associated with small production runs and
excessive costs. Their further development is
particularly important in order to make
ACC affordable for many drivers. Second-
generation ACC will achieve this goal with
the following measures:
(cid:0) Reducing the outer dimensions of the
sensor & control unit: Its current size
needs to be reduced by half, as in many
cases, it is difficult to install the unit in
the front area of vehicles. Advances in the
area of electronic components allow the
unit to be even more compact and highly
integrated.

(cid:0) Expanding the detection range:

So that ACC can also be used on highways
with tight curves, the angle range that can
be evaluated by the sensors is being
roughly doubled (16°). This is achieved by
making the lens antenna smaller and in-
creasing the number of radar lobes from
three to four. Expanding the detection
range in this way means that the radar
 energy is spread into a wider area. To
 prevent this from causing an unwanted
reduction of the range, the circuitry for
increasing the signal quality is being im-
proved; this way, the range can actually
be increased.

In addition to these further developments in
the area of ACC sensors, Bosch is working
on the development of additional new envi-
ronment sensors for use in future driving
 assistance systems (Fig. 1, next page).

Function
Perfecting the present functional range
Perfecting the present functional range will
allow future systems to be more reliable in
their target selection and have even more
adaptive control systems. The latter will be
evident in more harmonious control behav-
ior in lane change situations and in curves.

In the future, ACC will also work at driving
speeds from 30 kilometers per hour down to
a complete stop, and provide automatic as-
sistance to the driver when restarting. Thus
ACC relieves the driver of tasks even in very
dense traffic, including traffic jams.

ACCplus for the entire speed range
Until now, ACC shut itself off in slow-mov-
ing traffic with speeds under 30 kilometers
per hour. The newly developed ACCplus of-
fers a significant improvement: the system
controls the distance from the vehicle dri-
ving ahead in a way that varies with that ve-
hicle’s speed, all the way down to a complete
stop. If the vehicle in front restarts, the dri-
ver is notified with a visual and – depending
on the application – acoustic signal. 

However, the decision as to whether or not
to restart the vehicle after the stop remains
with the driver. To follow the car ahead, all
he or she needs to do is briefly push the
ACC control element on the steering wheel
or gently depress the accelerator pedal. In
this way, ACCplus is particularly helpful to
the driver in slow-moving traffic all the way
down to a complete stop. Of course, the dri-
ver can intervene in the system at any time
and manually accelerate or decelerate the car
as necessary.

All ACC systems offer these opportunities

for driver intervention, since ACC is in-
tended to relieve the driver of tasks, not to
strip the driver of decision-making power.

Predictive safety functions
ACC2 is the core of future predictive safety
systems (PSS). If ACC detects a critical
 traffic situation in the first level (PSS1), the
brake linings are applied to the brake disks
and the brake assist is set for a possible panic
braking. Then, if the driver hits the brakes,
fewer valuable fractions of a second are
 required for full deceleration effect. 

Further expansion stages of the predictive
safety system will include functions for
warning the driver of impending collisions
by means of a short, sharp brake impulse
(PSS2) and automatic emergency brake
 interventions to reduce the severity of
 unavoidable accidents (PSS3).

Fully automatic starting with ACC full speed
range (FSR)
An even more future-oriented system than
ACCplus is ACC full speed range (FSR)
from Bosch. In addition to the signals from
the long-range radar, the system processes
information from a video camera and, in
some cases, close-range sensors. 

The system detects obstacles in front of
the vehicle – particularly those at close range
– even more quickly than ACCplus. Thus
ACC FSR is even better suited to stop-and-
go traffic, even on city thoroughfares. 

When the vehicle in front restarts, the addi-
tional information obtained using the video
camera allows fully automatic startup with-
out driver confirmation. For legal reasons,
however, this function will be restricted to a
relatively short period, up to approximately
ten seconds after the vehicle comes a com-
plete stop. After that, the driver must restart
manually without any assistance. 

ACC will continue to gain market share,
particularly due to the expanded functional
range and added safety. The range of vehi-
cles equipped with ACC also continues to
expand: after starting in the premium class,
ACC has already become available in upper
midsize models and will soon be introduced
in compact models.

Parking systems

Parking aid with ultrasonic sensors

Parking systems

On virtually all motor vehicles, the bodies
have been designed and developed in such a
way as to achieve the lowest possible drag
coefficient values in order to reduce fuel
consumption. Generally speaking, this
trend has resulted in a gentle wedge shape
which greatly restricts the driver’s view
when maneuvering. Obstacles can only be
poorly discerned – if at all.

Parking aid
with ultrasonic sensors

Application
Parking aids with ultrasonic sensors provide
drivers with effective support when parking.
They monitor an area of approx. 30 cm to
150 cm behind or in front of the vehicle
(Fig. 1). Obstacles are detected and brought
to the driver’s attention by optical and/or
acoustic means.

System
The system comprises the following compo-
nents: ECU, warning element and ultrasonic
sensors.

1

Scanning range of parking systems with all-around
monitoring

Vehicles with rear-end protection normally
have only 4 ultrasonic sensors in the rear
fender. Additional front-end protection is
provided by a further 4 to 6 ultrasonic sen-
sors in the front bumper (Fig. 3).

The system is automatically activated when

reverse gear is engaged or, for systems with
additional front protection, when the speed
falls below a threshold of approximately
15 km/h. During operation, the self-test
function ensures continuous monitoring of
all system components.

Ultrasonic sensor
Following a principle that is similar to
echo depth sounding, the sensors transmit
ultrasonic pulses at a frequency of approx.
40 kHz, and measure the time taken for the
echo pulses to be reflected back from obsta-
cles. The distance of the vehicle to the near-
est obstacle is calculated from the propaga-
tion time of the first echo pulse to be re-
ceived back according to the equation:

a = 0.5 · te · c

te propagation time of ultrasonic signal(s)
c velocity of sound in air (approx. 340 m/s).

Fig. 2 shows another example for the dis-
tance calculation.

The sensors themselves consist of a plastic
housing with integrated plug-in connec-
tion, an aluminum diaphragm with a piezo-
ceramic wafer attached to the inside, and a
printed circuit board with transmit and
evaluation electronics (Fig. 4). They are
electrically connected to the ECU by three
wires, two of which supply the power. The
third, bidirectional signal line is responsible
for activating the transmit function and re-
turning the evaluated received signal to the
ECU. When the sensor receives a digital
transmit pulse from the ECU, the electronic
circuit excites the aluminum diaphragm
with square wave pulses at the resonant fre-
quency so that it vibrates, and ultrasound is
emitted. The diaphragm, which has mean-

while returned to rest, is made to vibrate
again by the sound reflected back from the
obstacle. These vibrations are converted by
the piezoceramic wafer to an analog electri-
cal signal which is then amplified and con-
verted to a digital signal by the sensor
 electronics.

To detect the widest possible range, the
detection characteristics must meet special
requirements (Fig. 5 and 6). In the horizon-
tal range, a wide detection angle is desirable.
In the vertical range, however, it is necessary
to have a smaller angle in order to avoid in-
terference from ground reflections. A com-
promise is needed here so that obstacles can
be reliably detected.

Protection area
The protection area is determined by the
range and number of sensors and by their
emission characteristic.

Previous experience has shown that 4
 sensors are sufficient for rear-end protec-
tion, and 4 to 6 for front-end protection.
The sensors are integrated into the bumper,
and thus the distance to the ground is fixed
(Fig. 9 and 10).

The installation angle of, and the gaps be-
tween, the sensors are measured on a vehi-
cle-specific basis. This data is taken into ac-
count in the ECU’s calculation algorithms.
At the time of going to press, application
 engineering had already been carried out
on more than 200 different vehicle types.
Thus, even older vehicles can be retrofitted.

Electronic control unit
The ECU contains a voltage stabilizer for the

Warning elements
The warning elements display the distance
from an obstacle. Their design is specific to
the vehicle, and they usually provide for a
combination of acoustic signal and optical
display. Both LEDs and LCDs are currently
used for optical displays.

In the example of a warning element shown
here, the indication of the distance from the
obstacle is divided into 4 main ranges (see
Fig. 8 and table).

Extended range
The present sensor range of about 150 cm 
is sometimes perceived to be too short by
accustomed parkers. For this reason, a new
sensor with a range up to 250 cm is cur-
rently under development. Due to greater
levels greater packaging density of the elec-
tronics, it is also much smaller in size than
the present generation of devices. This is a
welcome improvement, particularly with
 regard to increased pedestrian safety
 requirements for fenders.

Parking space measurement
Another possible application for ultrasonic
sensors is measuring the size of a parking
space.

After the driver activates the system, a
sensor mounted on the side of the vehicle
measures the length of the parking space.
After comparing the measured length with
the signals from the wheel speed sensor as a
plausibility check, the system indicates to the
driver whether the parking space is long
enough (Fig. 11). 

A further refinement will make it possi-
ble for the system to suggest to the driver
the optimum amount of steering lock re-
quired in order to complete the parking
maneuver with the least effort. Systems
with electric steering activation are also
in development.

Parking systems

Ultrasonic sensors

Ultrasonic sensors

Application
Ultrasonic sensors are integrated in the vehi-
cle’s bumpers for determining the distance
to obstacles, and for monitoring the area to
the front and rear of the vehicle when enter-
ing or leaving a parking lot or when ma-
noeuvring. Using “triangulation”, the very
wide sensing angle which results when a
number of sensors are used (4 to the rear,
4...6 to the front), can be applied to calculate
the distance and angle to an obstacle. Such a
system has a detection range of about
0.25 m...1.5 m.

Design and construction
These sensors are comprised of a plastic case
with integrated plug-in connection, an ul-
trasonic transducer (aluminum diaphragm
onto the inside of which has been glued a
piezoelectric disc), and a PCB with transmit
and evaluation electronics (Fig. 1). Two of
the three connecting wires leading to the
ECU carry the supply voltage. The third line
is bi-directional and is used to trigger the
transmit function so that the evaluated re-
ceive signal can be reported back to the ECU
(open-collector connection with open-cir-
cuit potential “high”).

Operating concept
These ultrasonic sensors operate according
to the pulse/echo principle in combination
with triangulation. Upon receiving a digital
transmit pulse from the ECU, within typi-
cally about 300 µs, the electronic circuitry
excites the aluminum diaphragm with
square-wave pulses at resonant frequency
and causes this to transmit ultrasound. The
 reflection from the obstacle hits the di-
aphragm and causes it to go into oscillation
again (it had in the meantime stopped oscil-
lating). During the time taken for it to stop
oscillating (approx. 900 µs) no reception is
possible. These renewed oscillations are out-
putted by the piezoceramic as analog electri-
cal signals and amplified and converted to 
a digital signal by the sensor electronics
(Fig. 2). The sensor has priority over the
ECU, and when it detects an echo signal it
switches the signal connection to “low”
(<0.5 V). If there is an echo signal on the
line, the transmit signal cannot be pro -
cessed. The ECU excites the sensor to trans-
mit when there is less than 1.5 V on the line.
In order to be able to monitor as extensive

a range as possible, a wide sensing angle is
used in the horizontal plane. In the vertical
plane, on the other hand, only a narrow an-
gle is required in order to avoid disturbance
due to road-surface reflections.

History of the seat belt

235

(cid:0)

History of the seat belt

When in 1902, Ohio native Walter C. Baker
rolled over in his electric car, he was the first
racecar driver to have his life saved by a “seat
belt”.

The seat belt – in Baker’s day, a simple
leather belt used primarily by racecar drivers
to literally strap themselves to the vehicle –
has had a consistent evolution over the last
hundred years. The goal has always been to
make the belt safer and more comfortable and
convenient to use. 

Although the first shoulder belts used in cars
held the occupants in their seats, they did not
protect their head and upper body from im-
pact against the steering wheel. To prevent
this “jackknife” effect, suspender-like belts
crossed over the chest came into use at an
early stage. However, these were not only

awkward to use, they sometimes allowed the
occupants to slip through underneath the belt
in the event of an accident. 

Help in both respects was provided by
the three-point belt, patented in 1958, which
today remains the basis for all modern belt
systems. 

As early as the 1960s, experiments proved
the usefulness of the seat belt. In addition, the
invention of the automatic seat belt retractor
allowed occupants to fasten their seat belts in
mere seconds. However, even after seat belt
use was mandated by law in Germany in
1976, only half of front seat passengers buck-
led up. Only when a fine was introduced in
1984 to remind drivers and passengers of the
benefits of seat belts did their use rate rise to
over 90 %.

Instrumentation

Information and communication areas, driver information systems

Instrumentation

Drivers have to process a constantly in-
creasing stream of information originating
from their own and other vehicles, from the
road, and from telecommunications equip-
ment. All this information must be con-
veyed to drivers in the information and
communications areas of the vehicle on
suitable display and indicating equipment
that comply with ergonomic requirements.
In the future, in-car cellular phones, naviga-
tion systems, and distance control systems
will join automotive sound systems and
 vehicle monitoring systems as standard
equipment in motor vehicles.

Information and
 communication areas

In any vehicle, there are four information
and communication areas which must sat-
isfy different requirements in terms of their
display features:

1

Driver information area (development)

(cid:0) Instrument cluster
(cid:0) Windshield 
(cid:0) Center console
(cid:0) Vehicle rear compartment

The display features in these areas are deter-
mined by the available range of information
and the necessary, useful, or desirable infor-
mation for the occupants.

1. Dynamic information and monitoring in-
formation (e.g. fuel level), to which the
driver should respond, is displayed on the
instrument cluster as close as possible to
the driver’s primary field of vision.

2. A head-up display (HUD), which projects
the information onto the windshield, is ide-
ally suited to engage the driver’s attention
and displaying information such as warn-
ings from a radar distance control system
(ACC) or route directions. The display is
supplemented acoustically by voice output. 

3. Status information or dialog prompts are
mainly displayed in the vicinity of the
control unit in the center console. 

4. Information of an entertainment nature

belongs in the vehicle rear compartment, far
away from the primary field of vision. This
is also the ideal location for a mobile office.
The backrest of the front passenger seat is a
suitable installation location for the moni-
tor and operator unit of a laptop computer.

Driver information systems

The driver information area in the vehicle
cockpit and the display technologies used
have gone through the following stages of
development (Fig. 1):

Individual and combined instruments
Conventional individual instruments for the
optical output of information were initially
superseded by more cost-effective instrument
clusters (combination of several information
units in a single housing) with good illumina-

tion and antireflection qualities. So that a con-
tinually increasing amount of information
could be accommodated in the available
space, today’s instrument cluster evolved over
time, featuring several needle instruments and
numerous indicator lamps (Fig. 1, Item 1).

Digital displays
Digital instruments
The digital instruments fitted up to the 1990s
displayed information using vacuum fluores-
cence display (VFD) technology and, later,
liquid crystal (LCD) technology, but they
have now largely disappeared. Instead, con-
ventional analog needle instruments are used
in combination with displays. At the same
time, there is an increase in the size, resolu-
tion and color representation of the displays. 

Central display and operator unit 
in the center console
With the advent of automotive information,
navigation, and telematics systems, screens
and keyboards on the center console are
now becoming widespread. Such systems
combine all the additional information from
functional units and information compo-
nents (e.g. cellular phone, car radio/CD,
controls for heating/air conditioning
(HVAC) and – important for Japan – the
“TV” function) into a central display and
operator unit. The components are inter-
connected in a network and are capable of
interactive communication. 

Positioning this terminal, which is of uni-

versal use to driver and passenger, in the
center console is effective and necessary
from both ergonomic and technical stand-
points. The optical information appears in a
graphics display. The demands placed by TV
reproduction and the navigation system on
the video/map display determine its resolu-
tion and color reproduction (Fig. 1, Item 2).

Graphics modules
Fitting vehicles with a driver’s airbag and
power-assisted steering as standard has re-
sulted in a reduction in the view through the
top half of the steering wheel. At the same

time the amount of information that has to
be displayed in the installation space avail-
able has increased. This creates the need for
additional display modules with graphics ca-
pabilities and display areas that can show any
information flexibly and in prioritized form.
This tendency results in instrumentation
featuring a classical needle instrument but
supplemented by a graphics display. The
central screen is also at the level of the in-
strument cluster (Fig. 1, Item 3). The impor-
tant issue for all visual displays is that they
can be easily read within the driver’s pri-
mary field of vision or its immediate vicinity
without the driver having to look away from
the road for long periods, as is the case, for
instance, if the displays are positioned in the
lower area of the center console. 

The graphics modules in the instrument
cluster permit mainly the display of driver
and vehicle-related functions such as service
intervals, check functions covering the vehi-
cle’s operating state, as well as vehicle diag-
nostics as needed for the workshop. They
can also show route direction information
from the navigation system (no digitized
map excerpts, only route direction symbols
such as arrows as turnoff instructions or in-
tersection symbols). The originally mono-
chrome units are now being superseded on
higher-specification vehicles by color dis-
plays (usually TFT screens), which can be
read more quickly and easily because of
their color resolution.

For the central display monitor with an
integrated information system, the tendency
is now to switch from a 4 : 3 aspect ratio to a
wider format with a 16 : 9 aspect ratio (film
format), which allows additional route di-
rection symbols to be displayed as well as
the map. 

Individual module with computer
 monitor
Beginning around 2006, TFT displays will be
used to represent analog instruments for the
first time (Fig. 1, Item 4). For cost reasons,
however, this technology will only gradually
replace conventional displays.

Design
Microcontroller technology and the ongoing
networking of motor vehicles have mean-
while transformed instrument clusters from
precision mechanical instruments to elec-
tronically dominated devices. A typical in-
strument cluster (LED-illuminated, with
TN-type segment LCDs using conductive
rubber, see Fig. 1) is a very flat component
(electronics, flat stepping motors), and vir-
tually all the components (mainly SMT) are
directly contacted on a printed circuit
board.

Method of operation
While the basic functions are the same in
most instrument clusters (Fig. 2), the parti-
tioning of the function modules in (partly
application-specific) microcontrollers,
ASICs, and standard peripherals sometimes
differs significantly (product range, display
scope, display types).

Electronic instrument clusters indicate

measured variables with high accuracy
thanks to stepping motor technology, and
take over “intelligent” functions such as
speed-dependent oil pressure warning, pri-
oritized fault display in matrix displays, or
service interval indicator. Even online diag-
nostic functions are standard and take up a
significant part of the program memory.

Since instrument clusters are part of the 
basic equipment of any vehicle, and all bus
systems come together here in any case, they
also incorporate gateway functions to a 
certain degree; in other words, they act as
bridges between different bus systems in the
vehicle (e.g. engine CAN, body CAN, and

ment replaced the bulky eddy current
speedometer. Nowadays, more durable
geared stepping motors, which are very  slim-
fitting, have become the preferred choice.
Due to a compact magnetic circuit and
(mostly) 2-stage gearing with a power output
of only about 100 mW, these motors allow
swift and highly accurate needle positioning.

Lighting
Instrument clusters were originally lit by
frontlighting technology in the form of incan-
descent lamps. Backlighting technology has
meanwhile gained acceptance on account of
its attractive appearance. Bulbs have been
 replaced by long-lasting light emitting diodes
(LEDs). LEDs are also suitable as warning
lamps and for backlighting scales, displays
and, via plastic optical waveguides, needles
(refer to Table 1, “Overview of lighting
sources”).

The efficient yellow, orange, and red 
InAllnGaP technology LEDs are now in
widespread use. The more recent InGaN
technology has produced significant effi-
ciency improvements for the colors green,
blue, and white. Here, white is obtained by

combining a blue LED chip with an orange-
emitting  luminescent material (yttrium-
aluminum granulate).

However, special technologies are also
 being used for specialized configurations:
(cid:0) CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamps):
Mainly for “black screen” instruments,
which appear black when they are deacti-
vated. When combined with a tinted view
cover (with e.g. 25% transmission), these
very bright lamps (high luminance, high
voltage) produce a brilliant appearance
with outstanding contrast. Since color
LCDs have very low transmission (typi-
cally about 6%), it is imperative that
CCFLs are used to backlight them in
 order to obtain good contrast even in
 daylight.

(cid:0) EL (electroluminescent) film: This flat film,
which lights up when an alternating volt-
age is applied and achieves an extremely
even light pattern, has only been available
in a form suitable for automobiles since
about 2000. It offers extensive freedom of
design for color combinations and/or for
superimposing dial faces on display sur-
faces.

TN-LCD
TN-LCD (“twisted nematic liquid crystal
display”) is the most commonly used form
of display. The term stems from the twisted
arrangement of the elongated liquid crystal
molecules between the locating glass plates
with transparent electrodes. A layer of this
type forms a “light valve”, which blocks or
passes polarized light depending on whether
voltage is applied to it or not. It can be used
in the temperature range of –40°C to +85°C.
The switching times are relatively long at
low temperatures on account of the high
viscosity of the liquid crystal material.

TN-LCDs can be operated in positive con-
trast (dark characters on a light background)
or negative contrast (light characters on a
dark background). Positive contrast cells are
ideal for frontlighting or backlighting modes,
but negative contrast cells can only be read
with sufficient contrast if they receive strong
backlighting. TN technology is suitable not
only for smaller display modules but also for
larger display areas in modular, or even full-
size, LCD instrument clusters.

Graphics displays for instrument
 clusters
Dot matrix displays with graphics capabili-
ties are needed to display infinitely variable
information. They are activated by line scan-
ning and therefore require multiplex charac-
teristics. Under the conditions prevailing in a
motor vehicle, conventional TN-LCDs can

today produce multiplex rates of up to 1: 4
with good contrast and up to 1: 8 with mod-
erate contrast. Other LCD display technolo-
gies are needed to achieve higher multiplex
rates. STN and DSTN technologies are in
current use for modules with moderate reso-
lution. DSTN technology can be imple-
mented to provide monochrome or multi-
color displays.

STN-LCD and DSTN-LCD
The molecular structure of a super twisted
nematic (STN) display is more heavily
twisted within the cell than in a conven-
tional TN display. STN-LCDs allow only
monochrome displays, usually in blue-yel-
low contrast. Neutral color can be obtained
by applying “retarder film”, but this is not 
effective throughout the entire temperature
range encountered in the vehicle. The
DSTN-LCD (double-layer STN) features
considerably improved characteristics that
permit neutral black and white reproduction
over wide temperature ranges with negative
and positive contrast. Color is created by
backlighting with colored LEDs. Multicolor
reproduction is created by incorporating
red, green, and blue thin film color filters on
one of the two glass substrates. Under auto-
motive conditions, shades of gray are only
possible to a very limited extent. The result
of this is that the range of colors is limited to
black, white, the primary colors red, green,
and blue, and their secondary colors yellow,
cyan, and magenta. 

AMLCD
The task of the visually sophisticated and
rapidly changing display of complex infor-
mation in the area of the instrument cluster
and the center console can only be per-
formed effectively by an active matrix liquid
crystal display (AMLCD) which has high-
resolution liquid crystal monitors with video
capabilities. The best developed and mostly
widely used are the thin film transistor LCDs
(TFT LCDs) addressed by thin film transis-
tors. Display monitors with diagonals of 4″
to 7″ in the center console area and an ex-

Design
A typical HUD (Fig. 2) features an activated
display for generating the image, a lighting
facility, an optical imaging unit, and a “com-
biner”, on which the image is reflected to the
driver’s eyes. The untreated windshield can
also take the place of the combiner. Green
vacuum fluorescence displays (VFDs) are
most commonly used for HUDs with mod-
est levels of information content, whereas
more sophisticated displays generally use
TFTs based on polysilicone technology.
There are also projection systems under de-
velopment that allow a wider field of vision,
and therefore permit a step toward contact
analogous display, i.e. a warning about an
obstacle which is located below the driver’s
actual field of vision, for instance.

Display of HUD information
The virtual image should not cover the road
ahead so that the driver is not distracted
from the traffic or road conditions. It is
therefore displayed in a region with a low
road or traffic information content. In
order to prevent the driver from being over-
whelmed with stimuli in his primary field of
vision, the HUD should not be overloaded
with information, and is therefore not a sub-
stitute for the conventional instrument clus-
ter. It is, however, particularly well suited 
for displaying safety-related information
such as warnings, safety distance, and route
directions.

tended temperature range (–25°C to +85°C)
are available for motor vehicles. Formats of
10″ to 14″ with an even wider temperature
range (–40 °C to +95 °C) are planned for
 programmable instrument clusters.

TFT LCDs consist of the “active” glass
substrate and the opposing plate with the
color filter structures. The active substrate
accommodates the pixel electrodes made
from indium tin oxide, the metallic row and
column conductors, and semiconductor
structures. At each intersecting point of the
row and column conductors, there is a field
effect transistor, which is etched in several
masking steps from a previously applied
 sequence of layers. A capacitor is also fabri-
cated at each pixel (Fig. 1). The opposite
glass plate accommodates the color filters
and a “black matrix” structure, which im-
proves display contrast. These structures
are applied to the glass in a sequence of
 photolithographic processes. A continuous
counter electrode is applied on top of them
for all the pixels. The color filters are applied
either in the form of continuous strips
(good reproduction of graphics informa-
tion) or as mosaic filters (especially suitable
for video pictures).

Head-up display (HUD)
Conventional instrument clusters have a
viewing distance of 0.8 to 1.2 m. In order to
read information in the area of the instru-
ment cluster, the driver must adjust his vision
from infinity (observing the road ahead) to
the short viewing distance for the instru-
ment. This process of adjustment usually
takes 0.3 to 0.5 s. Older drivers find this
process strenuous or even impossible, de-
pending on their physical capabilities. HUD,
a technology involving projection, can elimi-
nate this problem. Its optical system gener-
ates a virtual image at such a viewing distance
that the human eye can remain adjusted to
infinity. This distance begins at approx. 2 m,
and the driver can read the information
with very little distraction, without having
to divert his eyes from the road to the instru-
ment cluster.

Orientation methods

Orientation, position-finding, navigation

Orientation methods

In order to be able to understand various
terms applied in road traffic, such as posi-
tion-finding by means of satellite, and vehi-
cle navigation, a number of the important
basic terms associated with orientation and
navigation methods are dealt with below.

Orientation

The word orientation is derived from the
Latin word “oriens” (rising [sun]). It stands
for navigation using the four points of the
compass.

Position-finding

Assignment
Position-finding is used to determine one’s
own position or that of a searched-for ob-
jective by means of measurement, direction
finding, or radiolocation techniques.

Reference systems
If considerable distances and areas are in-
volved, directions and locations can only be
determined using a reference system that
provides suitable, repoducible reference di-
rections (for instance, the starry sky (firma-
ment) and the direction of the sun or of a
mountain peak which is visible from a long
distance). 

The reference system for direction must be
 defined referred to a single, main direction
(North, for instance, which can easily be de-
fined using the Pole (North) Star). A name
or a number suffices for the input of any
other direction. 

In order to define a location, the reference
system for specifying and defining locations
relies upon at least two related numbers. In
addition, a system starting point and a sys-
tem zero point are needed as well as a main
or principle direction. In practice, these
stipu lations are complied with by using a
coordinate system. One of these systems is
the rectangular, linear cartesian coordinate

system, which is familiar from maps and
town/city street plans. 

The earth’s spherical shape means that when
a very large area is concerned, locations can
no longer be defined using cartesian coordi-
nates. A geographic coordinate system is
needed with a network of circular lines: 

The coordinate lines from North to South
all start and end at the poles and are termed
“Meridians”. At the equator, depending
upon angular distance, these are divided
into East and West degrees of longitude (the
prime meridian passes through Greenwich
near London). The second group of coordi-
nates run from East to West and cut all the
Meridians at right angles. The Equator
marks the starting point for counting in the
North and South degrees of latitude. 

Slight modifications are needed before
these coordinate lines apply on the actual
terrestrial globe. They are then no longer
circles but rather complicated curves by
means of which every point on the earth’s
surface can be defined using two digits. 

Navigation

Applications
Navigation is the continual definition of lo-
cation and direction as needed to arrive at a
desired destination. Position-finding is such
an essential component in the process of
navigation that very often no difference is
made between them and one simply speaks
of navigation, although navigation goes far
further. 

Among other things, navigation requires

that the globe be represented on a smaller
scale and that individual locations are clearly
shown in their respective positions. Com-
pared to a map though, a globe is far too un-
wieldy for entering routes, directions, and
distances. The problem is that spherical fig-
ures cannot be transferred to a flat surface
without distortion of the distances involved.

Coordinate systems
There are suitable coordinate systems avail-
able for representing areas of the earth’s sur-
face on maps. For instance, these include the
Mercator Projection system and the related
UTM (Universal Transversal Mercator Pro-
jection). These are particularly suitable for
land navigation. In both systems, projection
“beams” radiate from the globe’s center
point and project onto every point of the
earth’s spherical surface on a cylindrical 
generated surface. In one case it is applied 
to the equator, and in the other case turned
through 90° and applied to a meridian
(Figs. 1 and 2 respectively). In the subse-
quent calculations, the unavoidable distor-
tions are compensated for by means of a 
distortion factor. 

Developing the generated surface results

in a flat map sheet. Further-going proce-
dures are needed in order to define the 
location data (described using coordinate
systems in appropriate maps) in the vehicle
while it is on the move. 

Composite navigation
Composite navigation must be applied when
landmarks are missing and permanent posi-
tion-finding by astronomical means (astro -
navigation) is impossible (Fig. 3). Compos-
ite navigation can be applied if it is possible
to determine the direction taken by the vehi-
cle by means of a compass for instance, and
when the distance travelled can be mea-
sured. Composite navigation is the basis for
all independent or autonomous navigation
methods: A given travelled distance which is
so small that the vehicle has not changed its
direction perceptibly, is regarded as an ori-
ented road element (arrow or vector). If, by
means of computation (or on a drawing), a
large number of these road elements, begin-
ning with the coordinates of the starting lo-
cation and up to the coordinates of the pre-
sent position, are continually added to each
other, one is said to have “coupled” the lo -
cation. 

244

Orientation methods

Navigation

Map matching is impossible in areas which
are not covered digitally, and here naviga-
tion takes place solely by means of satellite
data. The display indicates the direction to
be taken, and the distance to destination is
shown as a straight-line distance. The dis-
play also indicates “OFF-ROAD”, in other
words an indication that the vehicle is not
driving on roads covered by the digital map.

Satellite navigation system GPS
At present, the GPS (Global Positioning Sys-
tem) navigation system is used by all auto-
motive navigation systems for determining
the vehicle’s position. The GPS is based on a
network of 24 intercommunicating Ameri-
can satellites which are used all over the
world for this purpose (Fig. 4).

These satellites are uniformly distributed

at an altitude of approx. 20,000 km. They
orbit the earth every 12 hours in six differ-
ent paths, and 50 times per second transmit
special position, identification, and time sig-
nals. Since May 2000, civilian users have also
been able to take advantage of accuracies of
about ± 10 m. 

Due to the differences in transit times, the
signals from the different satellites reach the
vehicle with a given time offset. Once the
signals from at least 3 satellites are received,
the navigation system’s computer calculates
its own geographical position (at least two-
dimensionally). 

If the signals from at least 4 satellites 
are received, 3-dimensional positioning is
poss ible. Depending upon satellite position,
a vehicle’s navigation system is able to re-
ceive up to as many as 8 satellite signals
simul taneously. 

This is not a new method, although today
computers are used to carry out the calcula-
tions electronically. Unfortunately, unavoid-
able discrepancies in determining the direc-
tion being taken and the distance travelled
inevitably lead to an error in the location
definition. Since the error increases along
with the length of the journey, it becomes
necessary to carry out corrections from time
to time. That is, a specific reference point
must be identified and its coordinates in-
putted into the system so that a comparison
can be made between the location and the
digital map (Map Matching), and the accu-
mulated errors compensated for. 

In an automotive navigation system, the
navigation computer applies the signals
from the tachometer sensor, or the wheel-
speed sensors, in determining the distance
travelled and the changes in direction. This
information is used to derive the data on the
route taken by the vehicle. Composite navi-
gation results from the above interaction.
The navigation computer performs map
matching several times per second, and the
road map stored on a CD-ROM is compared
with the vehicle’s route. As a result, accuracy
increases to ± 5 m (15 ft) within towns and
villages covered digitally in the CD-ROM
road map, and ± 50 m (150 ft) on country
roads and autobahns/motorways.

etc. (Fig. 5),

(cid:0) Multipath reception due to the transit-
time differences of reflected signals,

(cid:0) Influencing of the satellite clocks.

Even though these interference factors can
lead to inaccuracies in calculating  position,
the vehicle’s own information sensors can
nevertheless determine the vehicle’s posi-
tion. 

Vehicle navigation
Since composite navigation and satellite
navigation each have their specific advan-
tages and disadvantages, a combination of
both methods is used in the vehicle (Fig. 6).

In composite navigation, which is indepen-
dent of infrastructure, when the stretches of
road driven by the vehicle are added, the er-
rors accumulate. The positioning uncer-
tainty therefore increases as a function of
time. These errors must be corrected by
comparing the location and the digital map,
and by checking the composite navigation
by means of the calculated GPS position.

During longer journeys in areas not cov-
ered digitally, the vehicle-sensor errors accu-
mulate so that it becomes impossible to per-
form map matching. The GPS receiver
though provides the navigation computer
with the position together with the degree of
latitude and longitude 

Since GPS can be received all over the
world, this means that as soon as the vehicle
enters a “digitalised” area again, the appro-
priate data from the particular section of
road map in the navigation CD-ROM are
entered into the navigation computer (this
also applies when the system is taken into
operation for the first time, and when the
vehicle is transported by train or ferry). Map
matching again becomes possible, and the
starting point is soon found. 

Even though satellite navigation is avail-
able worldwide, and is also very accurate, it
can happen that reception interference
causes gaps in the positioning. In such cases,

the composite navigation is able to bridge
the GPS reception interference by applying
the information from the vehicle sensors to
improve the positioning accuracy. 

This means that on the one hand the com-
posite navigation is used to overcome the
GPS reception interference, and on the other
the GPS position is applied to check the
composite navigation.

The basic functions “Position finding”, “Selec-
tion of destination”, “Route calculation”, and
“Navigation to destination” are common to all
systems. Devices at the upper end of the scale
also provide colored map presentation. All
functions require a digital road map, which is
generally stored on a CD-ROM or DVD.

Navigation systems

Assignment, application, method of operation

Navigation systems

Navigation in the vehicle is defined as the
process of directing the driver to his/her
 intended destination by means of direction
arrows and voice-output instructions. Guid-
ance along the route uses a digital road map
and navigation satellites. Dynamic navigation
also makes use of digitally coded traffic
 reports.

Assignment

Navigation systems for automotive applica-
tions must continually provide the driver with
acoustic and visual recommendations on the
route to follow. In the process, the system re-
lies upon data received from the GPS navi -
gation satellites, the vehicle’s road speed and
its direction. From this data it generates the
symbols (Fig. 1a), road maps (Fig. 1b, c), and
voice-output instructions needed to direct the
driver to his/her destination. Apart from this,
the dynamic navigation system also reacts to
the actual traffic situation and corrects the
recommended route accordingly so that the
driver is directed past the obstacle to his/her
destination as quickly as possible.

Application

In recent years, navigation systems have
achieved widespread popularity. Initially, 
the systems on the market were mostly
retrofit systems, but have since become
available as standard equipment or as an
 option for integration into new vehicles.
This means that the sensors from a number
of different systems can be used jointly and
networked with other components. In the
driver's primary field of view, instrument-
cluster displays present him/her with the
 important information needed to navigate
the vehicle to its destination.

Many vehicle manufacturers have incorpo-
rated the navigation system into a compre-
hensive driver information system featuring
audio and telephone functions. This trend
will continue into the future.

Position finding
Compound navigation is used for position
finding. Here, so-called road elements are
added cyclically with regard to sum and angle
(compounded). This of course leads to an
 accumulation of errors which, however, are
compensated for by continually comparing
the vehicle’s position with the course of the
road on the digital map (this is known as 
Map Matching, Fig. 2).

247

The GPS (Global Positioning System) satel-
lite positioning system has increased in im-
portance now that artificial errors are no
longer introduced into the signal for mili-
tary reasons. GPS allows the systems to
function without any trouble, even after
temporarily driving outside of roads in-
cluded in the digital road map or transport-
ing the vehicle by ship or rail. The GPS 
antenna together with the receiver is an 
essential navigation-system component. 

Sensors
With the first-generation navigation systems,
position finding often used two inductive
wheel-speed sensors to determine the distance
traveled and the changes in direction, and an
earth’s-field sensor for determining the ab-
solute driving direction. For the most part,
GPS serves to compensate for serious sensor
errors, and for the re-entry into the stored
road network following prolonged periods 
on roads outside the digital road map. 

For current systems, it suffices to use the sim-
ple distance-traveled signal from the elec-
tronic tachometer. This signal is already com-
monly used in many vehicles for automatic
speed-dependent volume control on the car
radio. This tachometer sensor outputs a train
of pulses the frequency of which is propor-
tional to the vehicle’s speed. These pulses are
then evaluated by the navigation computer. 

The vehicle’s change of direction is registered
by a yaw sensor. When the sensor position
changes, this change is converted into a volt-
age from which the computer determines
whether the vehicle is accelerating, braking, or
changing direction. This sensor is very small
and features a high level of insensitivity to the
interference fields commonly found in the
 vehicle.

The earth's-field sensor is no longer re-
quired, as the vehicle's absolute direction 
of movement is determined from the GPS
 signals by means of the Doppler effect.

Navigation systems

Method of operation

Selecting the destinations
Map directories
The CD’s digital map contains directories
which are used for inputting the destination
in the form of an address. This necessitates
lists of all available locations. In turn, all these
locations need lists of the stored streets. Fur-
ther precision in the definition of the destina-
tion is attained by the inclusion of street
crossings/intersections and house numbers. 

Normally, the driver is unaware of the ad-
dresses for such destinations as airports, rail-
way stations, gas stations, and car parks etc.
Therefore, to make it easier to find them, the-
matic directories are provided that list these
destinations, which are frequently referred to
as POIs (Points of Interest). These directories
allow POIs such as a gas station in the area of
the vehicle to be located (Figure 1b on preced-
ing pages).

It is also possible to select a destination by
directly marking it on the map display or by
calling it up from a destination memory in
which it had already been stored.

Guidebooks
The logical consequence is the provision of
guidebooks on CD, which has resulted from
the cooperation between publishing houses
and the producers of the digital road maps.
This allows searches for POIs such as hotels
near the destination. Information is also avail-
able about the size, prices, and furnishings/
equipment level of the POIs (Fig. 3).

Route calculation
Standard calculation
The calculation of routes can be adapted to
the driver’s wishes. This includes the settings
for optimizing the route according to driving
time or distance as well as the ability to cir-
cumvent expressways, ferries or toll roads.
Driving recommendations along the route 
are expected within about 30 seconds after
 entering the destination.

The recalculation of the route when the driver
leaves the recommended route is even more
critical with regard to time. By the time the
driver reaches the next intersection, he or she
must have received updated recommenda-
tions. A “traffic jam” button must make it
 possible to exclude a certain road ahead and
calculate an alterative route.

Dynamic routes
The evaluation of RDS-TMC coded traffic re-
ports provides the basis for automatically cir-
cumventing traffic jams and congestions. Such
coded reports are received through RDS or
GSM. The necessary TMC codes are restricted
to expressways and major national highways.
An extension of the possibilities for using
new methods to make the system more dy-
namic is in development.

Navigation to destination
Defining the route
Navigation is a matter of comparing the vehi-
cle’s actual position with its calculated posi-
tion. The stretches of road which the vehicle
has just driven along, and the stretches of road
still in front it on the planned route, are used
in making the decision as to when the driver
must turn off. 

Route and direction recommendations
During the journey itself, and in good time
before turn-off points or lane changes, a voice
gives the driver the corresponding instruc-
tions. This audible instruction principle en-
ables the driver to comply with the recom-
mendations without distracting his/her atten-
tion from the surrounding traffic. A route and
direction arrow appears on a display at the
same time.

Simple graphics, which as far as possible 
are inside the driver’s primary field of vision
(instrument cluster), provide for even more
clarity.

Road-map memory
The CD is in widespread use as the road-map
memory. The DVD, with more than seven
times the storage capacity, can hold road maps
of much larger areas and thus is increasingly
displacing the CD.

The structure of the stored data is manufac-
turer-specific knowledge and has considerable
influence on the system's performance. This 
is the reason why CDs and DVDs for the sys-
tems of different manufacturers are usually
not compatible with each other.

In the future, vehicle-compatible hard discs

will be used for road-map memory. In addi-
tion to their higher capacity, these make it
possible to continually update the map.

Guidebooks on disk (CD or DVD) provide both
navigation and travel information 

The conciseness of these acoustic and visual
recommendations is of prime importance for
the navigation quality. Due to the danger of
distracting the driver, there is no question of
using the symbols on the street-card display 
as the primary instruction medium. This is a
“think-ahead” system and, as a function of 
vehicle speed, provides enough time for driver
response. 

Dynamic routes
The evaluation of coded traffic reports re-
ceived through the Traffic Message Channel of
the Radio Data System (RDS-TMC) parallel
to the radio broadcast provides for the auto-
matic circumvention of traffic jams and con-
gestion. RDS-TMC is already available to the
GSM services.

Route calculation centers around the ex-
pected average driving time for each section of
road. Using the traffic reports, the navigation
computer determines which sections of road
are affected by obstructions and takes these
into account when recalculating the route.
Here, the system inserts a lower average speed
depending upon the severity of the
obstruction. 

3

In case of traffic obstruction, if
there is a time-saving, alternative
route available with little conges-
tion, the dynamic navigation auto-
matically selects it and directs the
driver onto it by means of spoken
commands. 

Map presentation
Depending upon the particular sys-
tem, the road map can be displayed
on the color monitor with a scale of
between approx. 1:8000 and 1:16
million. This is a great help in ob-
taining an overview of the routes in
the nearer vicinity or further away.
Orientation is made easier by back-
ground information such as lakes,
built-up areas, railway tracks and
wooded areas.

Navigation software

Digital cartography
Digitalization
Digitalization is based on highly accurate
maps, and satellite and aerial photographs
which have been officially approved and re-
leased. If, in a given area, only inadequate
docu mentation is available, measurement and
surveying is performed on-site, and highly
trained experts (“road inspectors”) carry out
the digitalization by hand using special digi-
talization computers. Subsequently, the names
and classification of the objects concerned
(roads, streets, boundaries, lakes, rivers, and
canals etc.) is integrated in the database.

Road inspection
As well as checking the data from the initial
digitalization, the road inspectors register all
supplementary “traffic-relevant attributes”
(e.g. one-way roads, bridges, subways, tunnels,
and right-of-way rulings at difficult road
crossings) (Fig. 8).  

The results of this road inspection are inte-

grated in the database, and used in the pro-
duction of digitalized road maps in CD for-
mat. 

Additional POI
POI (Points Of Interest) are hotels, restau-
rants, sightseeing objectives, public authorities
and institutions whose names are well known
but not their addresses. These POI include ob-
jects in the sector of public authorities and in-
stitutions, as well as those of interest from the
touristic/cultural aspect. These form the basis
for a wide variety of guidebooks and special
guides. 

Quality check
At every production step, a quality check is
performed with special testing software, so
that errors in data collection can be immedi-
ately remedied. Moreover, sample on-site
checks are continually made to check geo-
graphical accuracy, correctness and actuality. 

Data formats
The data format is a regulation covering the
storage of data in line with a set of organiza-
tional criteria governing their processing. In
the case of data which has been digitally regis-
tered, one differentiates between the registra-
tion format (standardised exchange format
such as GDF), and the application format 
(e.g. TravelPilot format).

GDF
GDF (Geographic Data Files)  is a standard-
ized international exchange format for pre-
senting geographic features in the form of
vectors (refer below to “Vector map”). Among
other things, the GDF format ensures that the
vehicle navigation unit outputs the familiar
driving instructions notwithstanding the pe-
culiarities of the particular country’s road net-
work. The “Tele-Atlas Co.”, played a decisive
role in the drawing up of the GDF format. 

Vector map
The vector map generates geographic ele-
ments by means of a succession of straight
lines (vectors). The beginning and end of each
vector is clearly defined by geographic coordi-
nates and by specific attributes (e.g. name,
classification etc.). Vector maps are imperative
for mathematical calculation of the route. 

GIS
GIS (Geografic Information System) is a soft-
ware application which applies geographic in-
formation for analytic and planning purposes.
For instance, the calculation of  radio cells for
mobile-radio networks would be impossible
without GIS.

Geo coding
By allocating them a coordinate pair (latitude
and longitude), Geo coding can incorporate
additional objects or POI in the digital maps.

TravelPilot format
This is an application format for the navi -
gation CD of the Bosch/Blaupunkt navigation
systems, as covered by the TravelPilot logo.
The data of the GDF exchange format must
be converted to the TravelPilot format.

Basis CD
For a number of European countries,
Blaupunkt and Tele Atlas have cooperated in
producing basic CDs which serve as the basis
for navigation in the particular region. They
incorporate the complete road network in
digital form (minor roads and overland or
cross-country roads), and all traffic-related in-
formation such as one-way roads, “no turns”,
limited-access roads etc.).

For instance, for Germany, for all the major

economic areas and for all cities with more
than 50,000 inhabitants, all road/street names
are incorporated on the basis CD. And for
Berlin. Hanover, Munich, and Stuttgart, even
the house numbers are included. In addition,
many other destinations such as railway sta-
tions, airports, car-hire companies, hospitals,
and holiday/vacation areas are also available.

Guidebooks
Together with Varta, Michelin, Merian scout,
ANWB, and De Agostini, Tele Atlas has also
issued “Travel Guides” for selected countries
and cities/towns. Using such a Travel Guide, it
is possible to compile a selection of destina-
tions according to one’s personal tastes. 

As a rule, the information is listed under
specific categories (e.g. overnight stays, food
and drink, the arts, architecture, touristic in-
formation, entertainment etc.). Information 
is also provided on hotels and restaurants 
(together with special quality awards such as
“stars” and “chef’s hats” etc.), and points of in-
terest (POI). Of course, the system is also able
to navigate the driver to these destinations.

Special guides
Such guides restrict themselves to points of
special touristic interest. For instance, together
with Merian scout, Tele Atlas has drawn up a
special “Golf” guide.

Piezoelectric tuning-fork yaw-rate sensor

Piezoelectric tuning-fork
yaw-rate sensor

Application
In order that it can use the digital road map
stored on the CD-ROM to calculate the dis-
tance driven, the computer in the vehicle’s
navigation system needs information on the
vehicle’s movements (composite navi -
gation).

When cornering (for instance at road junc-
tions), the navigation system’s yaw-rate sen-
sor registers the vehicles rotation about its
vertical axis. With the voltage signal it gener-
ates in the process, and taking into account
the signals from the tachometer or the radar
sensor, the navigation computer calculates
the curve radius and from this derives the
change in vehicle direction. 

For navigation systems, the piezoelectric
tuning-fork yaw-rate sensor is increasingly
being displaced by the micromechanical
yaw-rate sensor.

Design and construction
The yaw-rate sensor is a steel element
shaped like a tuning fork, and incorporates
four piezo elements (two above, two below,
Fig. 1) and the sensor electronics. It mea-
sures very accurately and is insensitive to
magnetic interference. 

1

“Tuning-fork” piezo yaw-rate sensor 

Method of operation
When voltage is applied, the bottom piezo
elements start to oscillate and exite the up-
per section of the “tuning fork”, together
with its upper piezo elements, which then
starts counter-phase oscillation. 

Straight-ahead driving
With the vehicle being driven in a straight
line there are no Coriolis forces applied at
the tuning fork, and since the upper piezo
elements always oscillate in counter-phase
and are only sensitive vertical to the direc-
tion of oscillation (Fig. 1a) they do not gen-
erate a voltage.  

Cornering
When cornering on the other hand, the
Coriolis acceleration which occurs in con-
nection with the oscillation (but vertical to
it) is applied for measurement purposes.
The rotational movement now causes the
upper portion of the tuning fork to leave the
oscillatory plane (Fig. 1b) so that an AC
voltage is generated in the upper piezo ele-
ments which is transferred to the navigation
computer by an electronic circuit in the sen-
sor housing. The voltage-signal amplitude is
a function of both the yaw rate and the os-
cillatory speed. Its sign depends on the di-
rection (left or right) taken by the curve.

(cid:0)

Micromechanics

Micromechanics is defined as the application
of semiconductor techniques in the pro -
duction of mechanical components from semi-
conductor materials (usually silicon). Not only
silicon’s semiconductor properties are used
but also its mechanical characteristics. This
enables sensor functions to be implemented
in the smallest-possible space. The following
techniques are used:

Bulk micromechanics
The silicon wafer material is processed at the
required depth using anisotropic (alkaline)
etching and, where needed, an electrochemi-
cal etching stop. From the rear, the material is
removed from inside the silicon layer (Fig. 1,
Pos. 2) at those points underneath an opening
in the mask. Using this method, very small di-
aphragms can be produced (with typical thick-
nesses of between 5 and 50 µm, as well as
openings (b), beams and webs (c) as are
needed for instance for acceleration sensors. 

Surface micromechanics
The substrate material here is a silicon wafer
on whose surface very small mechanical struc-
tures are formed (Fig. 2). First of all, a "sacri -
ficial layer" is applied and structured using
semiconductor processes such as etching (a).
An approx. 10 µm polysilicon layer is then de-
posited on top of this and structured vertically
using a mask and etching. In the final process-
ing step, the "sacrificial" oxide layer under-
neath the polysilicon layer is removed by
means of gaseous hydrogen fluoride. In this
manner, the movable electrodes for accelera-
tion sensors (Fig. 3) are exposed. 

Wafer bonding
Anodic bonding and sealglass bonding are
used to permanently join together (bonding)
two wafers by the application of tension and
heat or pressure and heat. This is needed for
the hermetic sealing of reference vacuums for
instance, and when protective caps must be
applied to safeguard sensitive structures.

Workshop technology

More than 30,000 garages/workshops
around the world are equipped with work-
shop technology, i.e. test technology and
workshop software from Bosch. Workshop
technology is becoming increasingly impor-
tant as it provides guidance and assistance
in all matters relating to diagnosis and
 troubleshooting.

Workshop business

Trends
Many factors influence workshop business.
Current trends are, for example:
(cid:0) The proportion of diesel passenger cars is

rising

(cid:0) Longer service intervals and longer service
lives of automotive parts mean that vehi-
cles are being checked into workshops less
frequently

(cid:0) Workshop capacity utilization in the over-
all market will continue to decline in the
next few years

(cid:0) The need for workshop personnel to be
properly qualified is increasing dramati-

(cid:0) Investment by workshops in diagnosis,
technical information and training is

Measurement and test technology
The crucial step for workshops to take is to
invest in the right test technology, diagnostic
software, technical information, and techni-
cal training in order to receive the best pos-
sible support and assistance for all the jobs
and tasks in the workshop process.

Workshop processes
The essential tasks which come up in the
workshop can be portrayed in processes.
Two distinct subprocesses are used for han-
dling all tasks in the service and repair fields.
The first subprocess covers the predomi-
nantly operations and organization-based
activity of job order acceptance, while the
second subprocess covers the predominantly
technically based work steps of service and
repair implementation. 

Job order acceptance
When a vehicle arrives in the workshop, the
job order acceptance system’s database fur-
nishes immediate access to all available in-
formation on the vehicle. The moment the
vehicle enters the shop, the system provides
access to its entire history. This includes all
service work and repairs carried out on the
vehicle up to that point. Furthermore, this
sequence involves the completion of all tasks
relating to the customer’s request, its basic
feasibility, scheduling of completion dates,
provision of resources, parts and working
materials and equipment, and an initial ex-
amination of the task and extent of work in-
volved. Depending on the process objective,
all subfunctions of the ESI[tronic] product
are used within the framework of the service
acceptance process.

Service and repair implementation
Here, the jobs defined within the framework
of the job order acceptance are carried out.
If it is not possible to complete the task in a
single process cycle, appropriate repeat loops
must be provided until the targeted process
result is achieved. Depending on the process
objective, all subfunctions of the ESI[tronic]
product are used within the framework of the
service and repair implementation process.

Electronic service information
(ESI[tronic])
System functions for supporting the
 workshop process
ESI[tronic] is a modular software product
for the automotive engineering trade. The
individual modules contain the following
information:
(cid:0) Technical information on spare parts and

automotive equipment

(cid:0) Exploded views and parts lists for spare

parts and assemblies

(cid:0) Technical data and setting values
(cid:0) Flat rate units and times for work on the

vehicle

Application
The chief users of ESI[tronic] are motor
garages/workshops, assembly repairers and
the automotive parts wholesale trade. They
use the technical information for the follow-
ing purposes:
(cid:0) Motor garages/workshops: mainly for
 diagnosis, service and repair of vehicle
systems

3

ESI[tronic] workshop software for all vehicle makes

(cid:0) Assembly repairers: mainly for testing, 

adjusting and repair of assemblies

(cid:0) Automotive parts wholesale trade: mainly

for parts information

Garages/workshops and assembly repairers
use this parts information in addition to
 diagnosis, repair and service information.
Product interfaces enable ESI[tronic] to net-
work with other (particularly commercial)
software in the workshop environment and
the automotive parts wholesale trade in
 order, for instance, to exchange data with
the accounting merchandise information
system.

Benefit to the user of ESI[tronic]
The benefit of using ESI[tronic] lies in the
fact that the system furnishes a large amount
of information which is needed to conduct
and safeguard the business of motor
garages/workshops. This is made possible
by the broadly conceived and modular
ESI[tronic] product program. The informa-
tion is offered on one interface with a stan-
dardized system for all vehicle makes.

Comprehensive vehicle coverage is impor-
tant for workshop business in that the nec-
essary information is always to hand. This is
guaranteed by ESI[tronic] because country-
specific vehicle databases and information
on new vehicles are incorporated in the
product planning. Regular updating of the
software offers the best opportunity of keep-
ing abreast of technical developments in the
automotive industry.

Vehicle system analysis (FSA)
Vehicle system analysis (FSA) from Bosch
offers a simple solution to complex vehicle
diagnosis. The causes of a problem can be
swiftly located thanks to diagnosis interfaces
and fault memories in the on-board elec-
tronics of modern motor vehicles. The com-
ponent testing facility of FSA developed by
Bosch is very useful in swiftly locating a
fault: The FSA measurement technology and
display can be adjusted to the relevant com-

ponent. This enables this component to be
tested while it is still installed.

Measuring equipment
Workshop personnel can choose from
 various options for diagnosis and trouble -
shooting: the high-performance, portable
KTS 650 system tester or the workshop-
compatible KTS 520 and KTS 550 KTS
modules in conjunction with a standard PC
or laptop. The modules have an integrated
multimeter, and KTS 550 and KTS 650 also
have a 2-channel oscilloscope. For work
 applications on the vehicle, ESI[tronic] is
 installed in the KTS 650 or on a PC.

Example of the sequence in the
 workshop
The ESI[tronic] software package supports
workshop personnel throughout the entire
vehicle repair process A diagnosis interface
allows ESI[tronic] to communicate with the
electronic systems within the vehicle, such as
the ESP electronic control unit. Working at
the PC, the technician starts by selecting the
SIS (service information system) utility to
initiate diagnosis of on-board control units
and access the ECU’s fault memory. 

The diagnostic tester provides the data
needed for direct comparisons of specified
results and current readings, without the
need for supplementary entries. ESI[tronic]
uses the results of the diagnosis as the basis
for generating specific repair instructions.
The system also provides displays with other
information, such as component locations,
exploded views of assemblies, diagrams
showing the layouts of electrical, pneumatic
and hydraulic systems etc. Working at the
PC, users can then proceed directly from the
exploded views to the parts lists with part
numbers to order the required replacement
components. All service procedures and re-
placement components are recorded to sup-
port the billing process. After the final road
test, the bill is produced simply by pressing 
a few keys. The system also provides a clear
and concise printout with the results of the
vehicle diagnosis. This offers the customer 
a full report detailing all of the service 
operations and materials that went into the
vehicle’s repair.

Diagnostics in the workshop

Diagnostics in the workshop

The function of these diagnostics is to
identify the smallest, defective, replaceable
unit quickly and reliably. The guided trou-
bleshooting procedure includes onboard
information and offboard test procedures
and testers. Support is provided by elec-
tronic service information (ESI[tronic]).
Instructions for further troubleshooting
are provided for a wide variety of possible
problems (for example, ESP intervenes
prematurely due to variant encoding) and
faults (such as no signal from speed
 sensor). 

Guided troubleshooting
The main element is the guided trou-
bleshooting procedure. The workshop em-
ployee is guided by a symptom-dependent,
event-controlled procedure, which initiates

with the symptom (vehicle symptom or
 fault memory entry). Onboard (fault mem-
ory entry) and offboard facilities (actuator
diagnostics and offboard testers) are used.

The guided troubleshooting, readout of the
fault memory, workshop diagnostic func-
tions and electrical communication with
offboard testers take place using PC-based
diagnostic testers. This may be a specific
workshop tester from the vehicle manufac-
turer or a universal tester (e.g. KTS 650 by
Bosch). 

Reading out fault memory entries
Fault information (fault memory entries)
stored during vehicle operation are read out
via a serial interface during vehicle service or
repair in the customer service workshop.

Fault entries are read out using a diagnos-

tic tester. The workshop employee receives
information about:
(cid:1) Malfunctions (e.g. engine temperature

(cid:1) Fault codes (e.g. short circuit to ground,

implausible signal, static fault)

(cid:1) Ambient conditions (measured values on
fault storage, e.g. engine speed, engine
temperature etc.).

Actuator diagnostics
The control unit contains an actuator diag-
nostic routine in order to activate individual
actuators at the customer service workshop
and test their functionality. This test mode is
started using the diagnostic tester and only
functions when the vehicle is at a complete
stop below a specific engine speed, or when
the engine is switched off. This allows an
acoustic (e.g. valve clicking), visual (e.g. flap

movement), or other type of inspection, e.g.
measurement of electric signals, to test actu-
ator function.

Workshop diagnostic functions
Faults that the on-board diagnosis fails to
detect can be localized using support func-
tions. These diagnostic functions are imple-
mented in the ECU and are controlled by
the diagnostic tester.

Workshop diagnostic functions run auto-
matically, either after they are started by the
diagnostic tester, or they report back to the
diagnostic tester at the end of the test, or the
diagnostic tester assumes runtime control,
measured data acquisition, and data evalua-
tion. The control unit then implements indi-
vidual commands only.

Example
The assignment test checks that the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP) activates the
wheel brake cylinders of the correct wheels.
For this test, the vehicle is driven into the
brake tester. After the technician starts the
function, the diagnostic tester indicates how
to proceed. After the brake pedal is acti-
vated, individual channels of the ESP
 hydraulic modulator are brought, one after
another, to the pressure drop position.
This allows a determination to be made
of whether the corresponding wheel can be
rotated. The diagnostic tester indicates the
wheel for which the system has reduced the
brake pressure. In this way, it can be deter-
mined whether the circuitry of the hydraulic
modulator and wheel brake cylinders is
 correct.

Testing equipment

Effective testing of the system requires the
use of special testing equipment. While ear-
lier electronic systems could be tested with
basic equipment such as a multimeter, on -
going advances have resulted in electronic
 systems that can only be diagnosed with
complex testers.

The system testers of the KTS series 

are widely used in workshops. The KTS 650
(Fig. 1) offers a wide range of capabilities for
use in the vehicle repairs, enhanced in par-
ticular by its graphical display of data such
as test results. These system testers are also
known as diagnostic testers.

Functions of the KTS 650
The KTS 650 offers a wide variety of func-
tions, which are selected by means of but-
tons and menus on the large display screen.
The list below details the most important
functions offered by the KTS 650.

Identification
The system automatically detects the con-
nected ECU and reads actual values, fault
memories and ECU-specific data.

Reading/erasing the fault memory
The fault information detected during
 vehicle operation by on-board diagnosis
and stored in the fault memory can be read
with the KTS 650 and displayed on screen
in plain text.

Reading actual values
Current values calculated by the ECU can be
read out as physical values (e.g. wheel speeds
in km/h).

Actuator diagnostics
The electrical actuators (e.g. valves, relays)
can be specifically triggered for function
testing purposes.

Test functions
The diagnostic tester triggers programmed
test procedures in the ECU. These allow test-
ing of whether the channels of the ABS hy-
draulic modulator are correctly assigned 
to the wheel brake cylinders. 

Multimeter function
Electrical current, voltage and resistance can
be tested in the same way as with a conven-
tional multimeter.

Time graph display
The continuously recorded measured values
are displayed graphically as a signal curve, as 
with an oscilloscope (e.g. signal voltage of
the wheel speed sensors).

Additional information
Specific additional information relevant to
the faults/components displayed can also be
shown in conjunction with the electronic
service information (ESI[tronic]) (e.g. trou-
bleshooting instructions, location of com-
ponents in the engine compartment, test
specifications, electrical circuit diagrams).

Printout
All data (e.g. list of actual values or docu-
ment for the customer) can be printed out
on standard PC printers.

Programming
The software of the ECU can be encoded
 using the KTS 650 (e.g. variant coding of the
ESP ECU).

The extent to which the capabilities of the
KTS 650 can be utilized in the workshop
 depends on the system to be tested. Not all
ECUs support its full range of functions.

Brake testing

For compressed-air braking systems, the
 following also need to be checked:
(cid:0) air compressors,
(cid:0) compressed-air cylinders,
(cid:0) antifreeze unit,
(cid:0) valves, cylinders,
(cid:0) pressure regulators,
(cid:0) braking force regulators,
(cid:0) coupling heads and 
(cid:0) the air-tightness of the entire system.

Brake pads and shoes
The brake shoes and pads are the parts of
the braking system that are subject to the
greatest wear as the retardation of the vehi-
cle is achieved by pressing the shoes/pads
against the rotating drums/disks. Proper
maintenance of these components is ab-
solutely essential for the safety of a braking
system.

Checking wear
Assuming they have been correctly fitted,
the rate at which brake pads/shoes wear is
dependent on the properties of the friction
material (e.g. its frictional coefficient), the
manner in which the vehicle is driven and
the loads it carries. 

On most vehicles, reliable checking of the

brake pad wear on disk brakes requires the
removal of the wheels. Attempting to assess
the level of wear with the wheels in place
risks inaccurate conclusions. 

Checking the wear of brake shoes on
drum brakes generally involves removing
not only the wheels but also the brake
drums. 

On some more modern vehicles, inspec-
tion holes allow the brake shoe wear to be
checked without the brake drums having to
be removed, although they are inadequate
for a thorough inspection of overall brake
shoe condition.

Brake testing

Inspection and maintenance
The condition of a vehicle’s braking system
directly affects its safety as well as that of its
occupants and/or the goods it is transport-
ing. That is why the servicing of the braking
system is such an important part of the care
and maintenance of a vehicle.

Transport legislation requires that vehicle
braking systems are inspected at regular in-
tervals. Manufacturers’ authorized dealer-
ships, or approved independent workshops
and brake repair services (such as Bosch Ser-
vice) carry out inspection, maintenance and,
where necessary, repairs of the brake system. 
In Germany, vehicle owners or custodians
must present their vehicles for inspection at
an officially approved testing center at regular
intervals and at their own expense. In Ger-
many, for instance, the last month by which
the vehicle must file for a major roadworthi-
ness inspection is indicated by a  special check
tag on the vehicle’s rear license plate. 

The natural wear of brake system compo-
nents such as the brake pads demands that
the system is regularly serviced outside of
the statutory inspections.

In addition to checking the effectiveness

of the brakes on a brake tester, servicing
should involve regular assessment and main-
tenance of the following components:
(cid:0) brake pads and/or brake shoes,
(cid:0) brake disks, and
(cid:0) brake drums.

On hydraulic braking systems, the following
must also be regularly checked and serviced:
(cid:0) the master cylinder,
(cid:0) wheel brake cylinders,
(cid:0) the brake hoses,
(cid:0) the brake lines,
(cid:0) the brake fluid level and
(cid:0) the brake fluid condition.
Other units, such as the brake booster, brake
force distributor, brake force limiter etc. are
frequently maintenance-free.

Important!

The use of brake pads/
shoes that do not match
the specifications of the
brake manufacturer may
render the vehicle’s
 insurance policy void.

Adjustment
There is normally a small gap (clearance)
between the brake pad/shoe and the
disk/drum that prevents continuous abra-
sion of the friction material against the disk
or drum. As the friction material wears, that
gap becomes larger and, in the case of drum
brakes, necessitates regular readjustment of
the shoes (assuming the brakes do not in-
corporate a self-adjusting mechanism).
Disk brakes with an integral parking
brake mechanism automatically readjust
themselves. 

Straightforward disk brakes are likewise

self-adjusting. This means that the brake
pads automatically shift to take up the extra
gap as they wear so that in effect the clear-
ance between the pad and the disk never
changes.

The need for readjustment of the brake
shoes on drum brakes without a self-adjust-
ing mechanism can be detected by the
amount of free play when pressing the brake
pedal.

If, for different brake systems (such as
simplex or duplex brakes), the brake shoes
are adjusted, the information from the brake
manufacturer must be observed. 

Nevertheless, the following basic princi-

ples will always apply: 
Regardless of the type of drum brake, the
brakes on both sides must always be ad-
justed at the same time. On vehicles with
drum brakes all around, all four brakes must
be adjusted at once.

The brakes must be cold before they are
adjusted. The service brakes should be ad-
justed before the handbrake.

Replacing brake pads and shoes
Disk brake pads have to be replaced when
the thickness of the friction material is worn
down to 2 mm.

On systems with wear sensors on the
brake pads, a warning lamp on the instru-
ment panels indicates to the driver that the
pads are in need of imminent replacement
as soon as the remaining thickness is down
to 3.5 mm. 

On drum brakes the brake shoe friction lin-
ing thickness must not be less than 1.5 mm
on cars and 4 mm on commercial vehicles. If
the shoes are unevenly worn, or if the linings
are cracked or chipped, they too must be re-
placed.

When replacing brake pads or shoes, it is
important that the new pads/shoes conform
to the specifications of the original equip-
ment manufacturer.

Brake pads, disks, shoes and drums must
 always be replaced on both sides (i.e. both
front or both rear wheels) at the same time,
as otherwise the vehicle may “pull” to one
side under braking. 

Brake disks and drums
Brake disks and drums are made of steel or
cast iron and therefore do not wear as
quickly as the pads and shoes. Nevertheless,
they still have to be maintained at regular
intervals.

The contact surfaces of the brake disks

and brake drums must be checked for: 
(cid:0) striations, 
(cid:0) cracks,
(cid:0) corrosion,
(cid:0) abrasion and
(cid:0) differences of thickness. 
For disk and drum brakes, these defects can
be identified with the naked eye during a 
visual check. 

Brake disks can also develop excessive
runout or warping. The degree of runout at
the outer edge of the disk must not exceed
0.2 mm and has to be checked using a dial
gauge. Brake disks with more than the al-
lowable runout must be replaced.

If scored or unevenly worn brake disks are
reground, they must not be reduced to more
than a minimum permissible thickness. 

Brake drums may become misshapen (so
that they are no longer perfectly circular) or
develop hairline cracks. Loss of circularity is
caused by overheating. It can be detected by
pulsating feedback from the brake pedal or,
of course, on a brake tester. Brake drums can
be reground provided the degree of wear or

264

Workshop technology

Brake testing

damage is not excessive. When doing so, the
maximum allowable internal drum diameter
for the particular vehicle must not be ex-
ceeded. If the degree or nature of the dam-
age is such that regrinding the drums is not
possible, the only option is to replace them.
Drums must always be reground or replaced
on both sides (both front or both rear
wheels) at the same time in order to ensure
even braking.

Master cylinder
The wearing parts of the master cylinder are
primarily the cup seals, which are made of a

special rubber compound. They are respon-
sible for creating the seal between the piston
and the cylinder wall. Corrosion, which can
develop as a result of water absorption by
the brake fluid, causes pitting of the cylinder
wall. That roughness then damages the pis-
ton seals by abrading them so that they start
to leak.

Depending on the severity of the prob-
lem, this can result in partial or even total
loss of brake pressure. The response of the
brake pedal when depressed will indicate
whether the primary or the isolating seal is
leaking.

Wheel brake cylinders
As with the master cylinder, the cup seals 
in the wheel brake cylinders are subject to
wear. They can similarly develop leaks and
cause corrosion on the cylinder walls. In ad-
dition, wheel brake cylinders can also de-
velop leaks around the sealing caps. This can
lead to brake fluid contaminating the brake
pads/linings and reducing brake efficiency.

The following checks can be carried out to

test the condition of the seals:

Low-pressure test
A pressure gauge is connected to the wheel
brake cylinder and a pressure of 2 to 5 bar is
applied and maintained using a special pedal
positioner. There must be no drop in pres-
sure for a period of 5 minutes.

High-pressure test
A pressure of 80-100 bar is applied. Over a
period of 10 minutes, the pressure may not
drop by more than 10% of its original level.

Pilot pressure test
The pedal positioner is removed and the
pressure drops back to the pilot level (if 
applicable; only applies to cylinders with
cup seals) of 0.4-1.7 bar. The pressure
should not fall below 0.4 bar over a period
of five minutes.

Brake hoses and lines
In theory, brake pipes and hoses are mainte-
nance-free. Nevertheless, they are subject to
environmental effects such as corrosion due
to water and salt and impact damage from
stones, grit and gravel. 

Because of those factors, brake pipes and
hoses should be regularly inspected. Brake
lines should primarily be checked for corro-
sion, while the hoses should be inspected for
abrasion and splits. The unions should be
checked for leaks.

Brake fluid level and condition
The brake fluid level is checked on the brake
fluid reservoir. The fluid level should be
 between the “MAX” and “MIN” marks.
This check provides one means of detecting
whether there are leaks in the braking
 system. If the fluid level is at or below the
“MIN” mark, the system should be checked
for leaks. On some vehicles, a warning lamp
on the instrument panel indicates to the 
driver that the fluid level is approaching the
minimum mark.

As brake fluid can absorb water by

 diffusion through the brake hoses, it should
be completely replaced every one to two
years. 

This is absolutely essential for the safety of

the braking system.

1) Caution: 
If the level of fluid in the
reservoir is very low,
 simply adding more fluid
must on no account be
viewed as the solution.
The cause of the fluid
loss must be established
and rectified. Dark or
cloudy brake fluid must
be replaced immediately.
