History of the automobile

Mobility has always played a crucial role in
the course of human development. In al-
most every era, man has attempted to find
the means to allow him to transport people
over long distances at the highest possible
speed. It took the development of reliable
internal-combustion engines that were op-
erated on liquid fuels to turn the vision of 
a self-propelling “automobile” into reality
(combination of Greek: autos = self and
Latin: mobilis = mobile).

Development history

It would be hard to imagine life in our mod-
ern day without the motor car. Its emergence
required the existence of many conditions
without which an undertaking of this kind
would not have been possible. At this point,
some development landmarks may be worthy
of note. They represent an essential contribu-
tion to the development of the automobile:

In 1885 Carl
Benz enters the
annals of his-
tory as the in-
ventor of the
first automo-
bile. His patent
marks the be-
ginning of the
rapid develop-
ment of the
 automobile

powered by the internal-combustion engine.
Public opinion remained  divided, however.
While the proponents of the new age lauded
the automobile as the epitome of progress,
the majority of the population protested
against the increasing annoyances of dust,
noise, accident hazard, and inconsiderate
motorists. Despite all of this, the progress 
of the automobile proved unstoppable.

In the begin-
ning, the acqui-
sition of an au-
tomobile repre-
sented a serious
challenge. 
A road network

was virtually nonexistent; repair shops were
unknown, fuel was purchased at the drugstore,
and spare parts were produced on demand by
the local blacksmith. The prevailing circum-
stances made the first long-distance journey by
Bertha Benz in 1888 an even more astonishing
accomplishment. She is thought to have been
the first woman behind the wheel of a motor-
ized vehicle. She also demonstrated the relia-
bility of the automobile by journeying the then
enormous distance of more than 100 kilome-
ters (about 60 miles) between Mannheim and
Pforzheim in south-western Germany.

In the early days, however, few entrepreneurs
– with the exception of Benz – considered
the significance of the engine-powered vehi-
cle on a worldwide scale. It was the French
who were to help the automobile to great-
ness. Panhard & Levassor used licenses for
Daimler engines to build their own automo-
biles. Panhard pioneered construction fea-
tures such as the steering wheel, inclined
steering column, clutch pedal, pneumatic
tires, and tube-type radiator.

In the years that followed, the industry
mushroomed with the arrival of companies
such as Peugeot, Citroën, Renault, Fiat, Ford,
Rolls-Royce, Austin, and others. The influ-
ence of Gottlieb Daimler, who was selling
his engines almost all over the world, added
significant impetus to these developments.

Taking their original design from coachbuild-
ing, the motor cars of the time would soon
evolve into the automobiles as we know them
today. However, it should be noted that each
automobile was an individual product of
purely manual labor. A fundamental change
came with the introduction of the assembly
line by Henry Ford in 1913. With the Model T,
he revolutionized the automobile industry in
the United States. It was exactly at this junc-
ture that the automobile ceased to be an arti-
cle of luxury. By producing large numbers 
of automobiles, the price of an automobile
dropped to such a level that it became accessi-
ble to the general public for the first time. 
Although Citroën and Opel were among the

first to bring
the assembly
line to Europe,
it would gain
acceptance only
in the mid-
1920s.

Automobile manufacturers were quick to real-
ize that, in order to be successful in the market -
place, they had to accommodate the wishes of
their customers. Automobile racing victories
were exploited for commercial advertising.
With ever-advancing speed records, profes-
sional race drivers left indelible impressions of
themselves and the brand names of their auto-
mobiles in the minds of spectators. In addition,
efforts were made to broaden the product line.
As a result, the following decades produced a
variety of automobile designs based on the pre-
vailing zeitgeist, as well as the economic and
political influences of the day. E.g., streamlined
vehicles were unable to gain acceptance prior to
WWII due to the demand for large and repre-
sentative automobiles. Manufacturers of the
time designed and built the most exclusive au-
tomobiles, such
as the Merce -
des-Benz 500 K,
Rolls-Royce
Phantom III,
Horch 855, or
Bugatti Royale.

WWII had a sig-
nificant influence
on the develop-
ment of smaller
cars. The Volks -
wagen model
that came to be
known as the
“Beetle” was designed by Ferdinand Porsche
and was manufactured in Wolfsburg. At the
end of the war, the demand for cars that were
small and affordable was prevalent. Respond-
ing to this demand, manufacturers produced
automobiles such as the Goliath GP 700,
Lloyd 300, Citroën 2CV, Trabant, Isetta, and
the Fiat 500 C (Italian name: Topolino = little
mouse). The manufacture of automobiles be-
gan to evolve new standards; there was greater
emphasis on technology and integrated acces-
sories, with a reasonable price/performance
ratio as a major consideration.

Today, the em-
phasis is on a
high level of
occupant
safety; the ever-
rising traffic
volumes and
significantly
higher speeds compared with yesteryear are
making the airbag, ABS, TCS, ESP, and intel-
ligent sensors virtually indispensable. The
ongoing development of the automobile has
been powered by innovative engineering on
the part of the auto industry and by the con-
stant rise in market demands. However, 
there are fields of endeavor that continue 
to present a challenge well into the future.
One example is the further reduction of
 environmental burdens through the use of
alternative energy sources (e.g., fuel cells).
One thing, however, is not expected to
change in the near future – it is the one con-
cept that has been associated with the auto-
mobile for more than a century, and which
had inspired its original creators – it is the
enduring ideal of individual mobility.

More than 15 million
units were produced of
the Model T, affection-
ately called “Tin Lizzie”.

topped only by the

Nikolaus August

born in Holzhausen
(Germany), devel-
oped an interest in
technical matters at
an early age. Beside

torcycle, Daimler mainly worked on develop-
ing a gasoline engine suitable for use in road
vehicles. In 1889 Daimler and Maybach in-
troduced the first “steel-wheeled vehicle” 
in Paris featuring a two-cylinder V-engine.
Scarcely one year later, Daimler was market-
ing his fast-running Daimler engine on an
international scale. In 1891, for example,
 Armand Peugeot successfully entered a vehi-
cle he had engineered himself in the Paris-
Brest-Paris long-distance trial. It proved both
the worth of his design and the dependability
of the Daimler engine he was using.

Daimler’s merits lie in the systematic devel-
opment of the gasoline engine and in the
 international distribution of his engines.

he was preoccupied with the functioning of
gas-powered engines. 

From 1862 onward he dedicated himself
totally to engine construction. He managed
to make improvements to the gas engine
 invented by the French engineer, Étienne
Lenoir. For this work, Otto was awarded the
gold medal at the 1867 Paris World Fair.
 Together with Daimler and Maybach, he
 developed an internal-combustion engine
based on the four-stroke principle he had
formulated in 1861. The resulting engine is
known as the “Otto engine” to this day. In
1884 Otto invented magneto ignition, which
allowed engines to be powered by gasoline.
This innovation would form the basis for
the main part of Robert Bosch’s life’s work.

Otto’s singular contribution was his ability
to be the first to build the four-stroke inter-
nal-combustion engine and demonstrate its
superiority over all its predecessors.

Gottlieb Daimler
(1834–1900) hailed
from Schorndorf
(Germany). He
 studied mechanical
engineering at the
Polytechnikum engi-
neering college in
Stuttgart. In 1865 
he met the highly
talented engineer Wilhelm Maybach. From
that moment on, the two men would be
joined in a lasting relationship of mutual

Wilhelm Maybach
(1846–1929), a na-
tive of Heilbronn
(Germany), com-
pleted his appren-
ticeship as a techni-
cal draftsman. Soon
after, he worked as 
a design engineer.
Among his employ-

ers was the firm of Gasmotoren Deutz AG
(founded by Otto). He already earned the
nickname of “king of engineers” during his
own lifetime. 

Maybach revised the gasoline engine and
brought it to production. He also developed
water cooling, the carburetor, and the dual-
ignition system. In 1900 Maybach built a
revolutionary, alloy-based racing car. This
vehicle was developed in response to a sug-
gestion by an Austrian businessman named
Jellinek. His order for 36 of these cars was
given on condition that the model was to be
named after his daughter Mercedes.

Maybach’s virtuosity as a design engineer
pointed the way to the future of the contem-
porary automobile industry. His death sig-
naled the end of the grand age of the auto-
motive pioneers.

In 1893 the Duryea Brothers built the first
American automobile. Ford managed to even
the score in 1896 by introducing his own car,
the “Quadricycle Runabout”, which was to
serve as the basis for numerous additional de-
signs. In 1908 Ford introduced the legendary
“Model T”, which was mass-produced on as-
sembly lines from 1913 onward. Beginning in
1921, with a 55-percent share in the country’s
industrial production, Ford dominated the
domestic automobile market in the USA.

The name Henry Ford is synonymous with
the motorization of the United States. It was
his ideas that made the automobile accessi-
ble to a broad segment of the population.

company, a factory for iron-foundry
 products and industrial components in
Mannheim.

Independently of Daimler and Maybach,
he also pursued the means of fitting an en-
gine in a vehicle. When the essential claims
stemming from Otto’s four-stroke engine
patent had been declared null and void,
Benz also developed a surface carburetor,
electrical ignition, the clutch, water cooling,
and a gearshift system, besides his own four-
stroke engine. In 1886 he applied for his
patent and presented his motor carriage to
the public. In the period until the year 1900,
Benz was able to offer more than 600 models
for sale. In the period between 1894 and
1901 the factory of Benz & Co. produced the
“Velo”, which, with a total output of about
1200 units, may be called the first mass-pro-
duced automobile. In 1926 Benz merged
with Daimler to form “Daimler-Benz AG”.

Carl Benz introduced the first automobile
and established the preconditions for the in-
dustrial manufacture of production vehicles.

Henry Ford
(1863–1947) hailed
from Dearborn,
Michigan (USA).
 Although Ford had
found secure em-

Edison Illuminating
Company in 1891,
his personal interests were dedicated to the
advancement of the gasoline engine.

decided to become
an engineer at the
age of 14. He gradu-
ated from the Poly-
technikum engi-
neering college in

Munich with the best marks the institution
had given in its entire existence.

In 1892 Diesel was issued the patent for 
the “Diesel engine” that was later to bear his
name. The engine was quickly adopted as a
stationary power plant and marine engine. 
In 1908 the first commercial truck was pow-
ered by a diesel engine. However, its entrance
into the world of passenger cars would take
several decades. The diesel engine became the
power plant for the serial-produced Mercedes
260 D as late as 1936. Today’s diesel engine
has reached a level of development such that
it is now as common as the gasoline engine.

With his invention, Diesel has made a major
contribution to a more economical utiliza-
tion of the internal-combustion engine. Al-
though Diesel became active internationally
by granting production licenses, he failed to
earn due recognition for his achievements
during his lifetime.

Robert Bosch’s life’s work

Robert Bosch’s life’s work
(1861–1942)

“It has always been an
unbearable thought to
me that someone could
inspect one of my pro -
ducts and find it inferior
in any way. For that rea-
son, I have constantly
endeavored to make
products that withstand
the closest scrutiny –
products that prove
themselves superior 
in every respect.”

Robert Bosch

First ad in the Stuttgart
daily “Der Beobachter”
(The Observer), 1887

Robert Bosch, born on September 23, 1861 in
Albeck near Ulm (Germany), was the scion of
a wealthy farmer’s family. After completing his
apprenticeship as a precision fitter, he worked
temporarily for a number of enterprises, where
he continued to hone his technical skills and
expand his merchandising abilities and experi-
ence. After six months as an auditor studying
electrical engineering at Stuttgart technical
university, he traveled to the United States to
work for “Edison Illuminating”. He was later
employed by “Siemens Brothers” in England. 

In 1886 he decided to open a “Workshop 
for Precision Mechanics and Electrical
 Engineering” in the back of a dwelling in
Stuttgart’s west end. He employed another
mechanic and an apprentice. At the begin-
ning, his field of work lay in installing and
repairing telephones, telegraphs, lightning

conductors, and other light-engineering
jobs. His dedication in finding rapid solu-
tions to new problems also helped him gain
a competitive lead in his later activities.

To the automobile industry, the low-voltage
magneto ignition developed by Bosch in 1897
represented – much unlike its unreliable pre-
decessors – a true breakthrough. This product
was the launching board for the rapid expan-
sion of Robert Bosch’s business. He always
managed to bring the purposefulness of the
world of technology and economics into har-
mony with the needs of humanity. Bosch was
a trailblazer in many aspects of social care.

Robert Bosch performed technological pio-
neering work in developing and bringing the
following products to maturity: 
(cid:2) Low-voltage magneto ignition
(cid:2) High-voltage magneto ignition for higher
engine speeds (engineered by his colleague
Gottlob Honold)

(cid:2) Spark plug
(cid:2) Ignition distributor
(cid:2) Battery (passenger vehicles and motor cycles)
(cid:2) Electrical starter
(cid:2) Generator (alternator)
(cid:2) Lighting system with first electric headlamp

(cid:2) Bosch horn
(cid:2) Battery ignition
(cid:2) Bosch semaphore turn signal (initially

ridiculed as being typical of German sense
of organization – now the indispensable
direction indicator) 

At this point, many other achievements, 
also in the area of social engagement, would
be worthy of note. They are clear indicators
that Bosch was truly ahead of his time. His
forward-thinking mind has given great im-
petus to advances in automobile develop-
ment. The rising number of self-driving mo-
torists fostered a corresponding increase in
the need for repair facilities. In the 1920s
Robert Bosch launched a campaign aimed

at creating a comprehensive service organi-
zation. In 1926, within Germany, these ser-
vice repair centers were uniformly named
“Bosch-Dienst” (Bosch Service) and the
name was registered as a trademark.

Bosch had similarly high ambitions with
 regard to the implementation of social-care
objectives. Having introduced the 8-hour day
in 1906, he compensated his workers with
ample wages. In 1910 he donated one million
reichsmarks to support technical education.
Bosch took the production of the 500,000th
magneto as an occasion to introduce the
work-free Saturday afternoon. Among other
Bosch-induced improvements were old-age
pensions, workplaces for the severely handi-
capped, and the vacation scheme. In 1913 the
Bosch credo, “Occupation and the practice of
apprenticeship are more knowledgeable edu-
cators than mere theory” resulted in the in-
auguration of an apprentice workshop that
provided ample space for 104 apprentices.

In mid-1914 the name of Bosch was already
represented around the world. But the era 
of great expansion between 1908 and 1940
would also bring the strictures of two world
wars. Prior to 1914, 88 % of the products
made in Stuttgart were slated for export.
Bosch was able to continue expansion with
the aid of large contingents destined for the
military. However, in light of the atrocities of
the war years, he disapproved of the resulting
profits. As a result, he donated 13 million
reichs marks for social-care purposes. 

After the end of WWI it was difficult to regain
a foothold in foreign markets. In the United
States, for example, Bosch factories, sales of-
fices, and the corporate logo and symbol had
been confiscated and sold to an American
company. One of the consequences was that
products appeared under the “Bosch” brand
name that were not truly Bosch-made. It
would take until the end of the 1920s before
Bosch had reclaimed all of his former rights
and was able to reestablish himself in the
United States. The Founder’s unyielding de-

termination to overcome any and all obstacles
returned the company to the markets of the
world and, at the same time, imbued the
minds of Bosch employees with the interna-
tional significance of Bosch as an enterprise.

A closer look at two specific events may 
serve to underscore the social engagement 
of Robert Bosch. In 1936 he donated funds 
to construct a hospital that was officially
opened in 1940. In his inaugural speech,
Robert Bosch emphasized his personal dedi-
cation in terms of social engagement: “Every
job is important, even the lowliest. Let no
man delude himself that his work is more
important than that of a colleague.” 

With the passing of Robert Bosch in 1942,
the world mourned an entrepreneur who
was a pioneer not only in the arena of tech-
nology and electrical engineering, but also
in the realm of social engagement. Until this
day, Robert Bosch stands as an example of
progressive zeitgeist, of untiring diligence, 
of social improvements, of entrepreneurial
spirit, and as a dedicated champion of edu-
cation. His vision of progress culminated in
the words, “Knowledge, ability, and will are
important, but success only comes from
their harmonious interaction.”

In 1964 the Robert Bosch Foundation was
 inaugurated. Its activities include the pro-
motion and support of health care, welfare,
education, as well as sponsoring the arts and
culture, humanities and social sciences. 
The Foundation continues to nurture the
founder’s ideals to this day.

However, with further improvements in fuel
injection and mixture formation, Diesel’s in-
vention soon caught on and there were no
longer any viable alternatives for marine 
and fixed-installation engines.

History of the diesel engine

As early as 1863, the Frenchman Etienne
Lenoir had test-driven a vehicle which was
powered by a gas engine which he had 
developed. However, this drive plant proved
to be unsuitable for installing in and driving
vehicles. It was not until Nikolaus August
Otto’s four-stroke engine with magneto 
ignition that operation with liquid fuel and
thereby mobile application were made 
possible. But the efficiency of these engines 
was low. Rudolf Diesel’s achievement was 
to theoretically develop an engine with 
comparatively much higher efficiency and 
to pursue his idea through to readiness for
series production.

In 1897, in cooperation with Maschinen -
fabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg (MAN), Rudolf
Diesel built the first working prototype of a
combustion engine to be run on inexpensive
heavy fuel oil. However, this first diesel engine
weighed approximately 4.5 tonnes and was
three meters high. For this reason, this engine
was not yet considered for use in land 
vehicles.

sure was reduced from 250 to 90 bar, and
then later to 30 bar. This lowering of the pres-
sure, required for mechanical reasons, natu-
rally had a disadvantageous effect on com-
bustibility. Diesel’s initial plans to use coal
dust as the fuel were rejected.

Finally, in Spring 1893, MAN began 
to build the first, uncooled test engine.
Kerosene was initially envisaged as the fuel,
but what came to be used was gasoline,
 because it was thought (erroneously) that this
fuel would auto-ignite more easily. 
The principle of auto-ignition – i.e. injection
of the fuel into the highly compressed and
heated combustion air during compression –
was confirmed in this engine.

In the second test engine, the fuel was not
injected and atomized directly, but with the
aid of compressed air. The engine was also
provided with a water-cooling system.

It was not until the third test engine – a
new design with a single-stage air pump for
compressed-air injection – that the break-
through made. On 17 February 1897, Profes-
sor Moritz Schröder of Munich Technical
University carried out the acceptance tests.
The test results confirmed what was then 
for a combustion engine a high level of effi-
ciency of 26.2%.

Patent disputes and arguments with the
Diesel consortium with regard to develop-
ment strategy and failures took their toll,
both mentally and physically, on the brilliant
inventor. He is thought to have fallen over-
board on a Channel crossing to England on
29 September 1913.

Rudolf Diesel

Rudolf Diesel (1858–1913), born in Paris, de-
cided at 14 that he wanted to become an engi-
neer. He passed his final examinations 
at Munich Polytechnic with the best grades
achieved up to that point.

Idea for a new engine
Diesel’s idea was to design an engine with sig-
nificantly greater efficiency than the steam
engine, which was popular at the time. An en-
gine based on the isothermal  cycle should, ac-
cording to the theory of the French physicist
Sadi Carnot, be able to be operated with a
high level of efficiency of over 90%. 

Diesel developed his engine initially on pa-
per, based on Carnot’s models. His aim was to
design a powerful engine with comparatively
small dimensions. Diesel was  absolutely con-
vinced by the function and power of his en-
gine.

Diesel’s patent
Diesel completed his theoretical studies in
1890 and on 27 February 1892 applied to 
the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin for a
patent on “New rational thermal engines”. On
23 February 1893, he received patent docu-
ment DRP 67207 entitled “Operating Process
and Type of Construction for Combustion
Engines”, dated 28 February 1892.

This new engine initially only existed on
paper. The accuracy of Diesel’s calculations
had been verified repeatedly, but the engine
manufacturers remained skeptical about the
engine’s technical feasibility. 

Realizing the engine
The companies experienced in engine build-
ing, such as Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz AG,
shied away from the Diesel project. The re-
quired compression pressures of 250 bar were
beyond what appeared to be technically feasi-
ble. In 1893, after many months of endeavor,
Diesel finally succeeded in reaching an agree-
ment to work with Maschinenfabrik Augs-
burg-Nürnberg (MAN). However, the agree-
ment contained concessions by Diesel in re-
spect of the ideal engine. The maximum pres-

the process.

Compressed-air injection
Rudolf Diesel did not have the opportunity to
compress the fuel to the pressures required
for spray dispersion, spray disintegration and
droplet formation. The first diesel engine
from 1897 therefore worked with com-
pressed-air injection, whereby the fuel was in-
troduced into the cylinder with the aid of
compressed air. This process was later used by
Daimler in its diesel engines for trucks.

The fuel injector had a port for the com-

pressed-air feed (Fig. 1, 1) and a port for 
the fuel feed (2). A compressor generated the
compressed air, which flowed into the valve.
When the nozzle (3) was open, the 
air blasting into the combustion chamber also
swept the fuel in and in this two-phase flow
generated the fine droplets required 
for fast droplet vaporization and thus for
auto- ignition. 

A cam ensured that the nozzle was actuated

in synchronization with the crankshaft. The
amount of fuel to be injected as controlled by
the fuel pressure. Since the injection pressure
was generated by the compressed air, a low fuel
pressure was sufficient to ensure the efficacy of

The problem with this process was – on 
account of the low pressure at the nozzle –
the low penetration depth of the air/fuel mix-
ture into the combustion chamber. This type
of mixture formation was therefore not suit-
able for higher injected fuel quantities (higher
engine loads) and engine speeds. The limited
spray dispersion prevented the amount of 
air utilization required to increase power 
and, with increasing injected fuel quantity, 
resulted in local over-enrichment with a 
drastic increase in the levels of smoke. 
Furthermore, the vaporization time of the
relatively large fuel droplets did not permit
any significant increase in engine speed. 
Another disadvantage of this engine was the
enormous amount of space taken up by the
compressor. Nevertheless, this principle was
used in trucks at that time.

Precombustion-chamber engine
The Benz diesel was a precombustion-cham-
ber engine. Prosper L’Orange had already 
applied for a patent on this process in 1909.
Thanks to the precombustion-chamber 
principle, it was possible to dispense with the
complicated and expensive system of air in-
jection. Mixture formation in the main com-

bustion chamber of this process, which is still
used to this day, is ensured by partial com-
bustion in the precombustion chamber. The
precombustion-chamber engine has a spe-
cially shaped combustion chamber with 
a hemispherical head. The precombustion
chamber and combustion chamber are inter-
connected by small bores. The volume of the
precombustion chamber is roughly one fifth
of the compression chamber. 

The entire quantity of fuel is injected at ap-

proximately 230 to 250 bar into the precom-
bustion chamber. Because of the limited
amount of air in the precombustion chamber,
only a small amount of the fuel is able to
combust. As a result of the pressure increase
in the precombustion chamber caused by the
partial combustion, the unburned or partially
cracked fuel is forced into the main combus-
tion chamber, where it mixes with the air in
the main combustion chamber,  ignites and
burns. 

The function of the precombustion cham-
ber here is to form the mixture. This process
– also known as indirect injection – finally
caught on and remained the predominant
process until developments in fuel injection
were able to deliver the injection pressures re-
quired to form the mixture in the main com-
bustion chamber. 

Direct injection
The first MAN diesel engine operated with
direct injection, whereby the fuel was forced
directly into the combustion chamber via 
a nozzle. This engine used as its fuel a very
light oil, which was injected by a compressor
into the combustion chamber. The compres-
sor determined the huge dimensions of the
engine.

In the commercial-vehicle sector, direct-in-

jection engines resurfaced in the 1960s and
gradually superseded precombustion-cham-
ber engines. Passenger cars continued to use
precombustion-chamber engines  because of
their lower combustion-noise levels until the
1990s, when they were swiftly superseded by
direct-injection engines.

Use of the first vehicle 
diesel engines

Diesel engines in commercial vehicles
Because of their high cylinder pressures, the
first diesel engines were large and heavy and
therefore wholly unsuitable for mobile appli-
cations in vehicles. It was not until the
 beginning of the 1920s that the first diesel en-
gines were able to be deployed in commercial
vehicles.

Uninterrupted by the First World War,
Prosper L’Orange – a member of the execu-
tive board of Benz & Cie – continued his
 development work on the diesel engine. In
1923 the first diesel engines for road vehicles
were installed in five-tonne trucks. These
four-cylinder precombustion-chamber en-
gines with a piston displacement of 8.8 l de-
livered 45...50 bhp. The first test drive of the
Benz truck took place on 10 September with
brown-coal tar oil serving as the fuel. Fuel
consumption was 25% lower than benzene
engines. Furthermore, operating fluids such
as brown-coal tar oil cost much less than ben-
zene, which was highly taxed.

The company Daimler was already involved in
the development of the diesel engine prior to

the First World War. After the end of the war,
the company was working on diesel engines
for commercial vehicles. The first test drive
was conducted on 23 August 1923 – at 
virtually the same time as the Benz truck. At
the end of September 1923, a further test drive
was conducted from the Daimler plant in
Berlin to Stuttgart and back. 

The first truck production models with diesel
engines were exhibited at the Berlin Motor
Show in 1924. Three manufacturers were 
represented, each with different systems, 
having driven development of the diesel 
forward with their own ideas:
(cid:2) The Daimler diesel engine with com-

pressed-air injection 

(cid:2) The Benz diesel with precombustion cham-

(cid:2) The MAN diesel engine with direct injec-

ber 

tion

Diesel engines became increasingly powerful
with time. The first types were four-cylinder
units with a power output of 40 bhp. By 1928,
engine power-output figures of more than
60 bhp were no longer unusual. Finally, even
more powerful engines with six and eight
cylinders were being produced for heavy

commercial vehicles. By 1932, the power
range stretched up to 140 bhp.

The diesel engine’s breakthrough came in
1932 with a range of trucks offered by the
company Daimler-Benz, which came into 
being in 1926 with the merger of the auto-
mobile manufacturers Daimler and Benz.
This range was led by the Lo2000 model 
with a payload of 2 t and a permissible total
weight of almost 5 t. It housed the OM59
four-cylinder engine with a displacement 
of 3.8 l and 55 bhp. The range extended up 
to the L5000 (payload 5 t, permissible total
weight 10.8 t). All the vehicles were also 
available with gasoline engines of identical
power output, but these engines proved un-
successful when up against the economical
diesel engines.

To this day, the diesel engine has maintained
its dominant position in the commercial-ve-
hicle sector on account of its economic effi-
ciency. Virtually all heavy goods vehicles are
driven by diesel engines. In Japan, large-dis-
placement conventionally aspirated engines
are used almost exclusively. In the USA and
Europe, however, turbocharged engines with
charge-air cooling are favored.

 beginning of the 20th century, the diesel en-
gine also emerged as the drive source for this
mode of transport. The first ship to be fitted
with a 25-bhp diesel engine was launched in
1903. The first locomotive to be driven by a
diesel engine started service in 1913. The en-
gine power output in this case was 1,000 bhp.
Even the pioneers of aviation showed interest
in the diesel engine. Diesel engines provided
the propulsion on board the Graf  Zeppelin
airship.

Diesel engines in passenger cars
A few more years were to pass before the
diesel engine made its debut in a passenger
car. 1936 was the year, when the Mercedes
260D appeared with a four-cylinder diesel 
engine and a power output of 45 bhp.

The diesel engine as the power plant for
passenger cars was long relegated to a fringe
existence. It was too sluggish when compared
with the gasoline engine. Its image was to
change only in the 1990s. With exhaust-gas
turbocharging and new high-pressure fuel-
injection systems, the diesel engine is now on
an equal footing with its gasoline counterpart.
Power output and environmental perfor-
mance are comparable. Because the diesel en-
gine, unlike its gasoline counterpart, does not
knock, it can also be turbocharged in the
lower speed range, which results in high
torque and very good driving performance.
Another advantage of the diesel engine is, 
naturally, its excellent efficiency. This has led
to it becoming increasingly accepted among
car drivers – in Europe, roughly every second
newly registered car is a diesel.

History of the diesel engine

Robert Bosch

tion for diesel engines were fuel-injection
pumps and nozzles.

Even Rudolf Diesel had wanted to inject
the fuel directly, but was unable to do this be-
cause the fuel-injection pumps and nozzles
needed to achieve this were not available.
These pumps, in contrast to the fuel pumps
used in compressed-air injection, had to be
suitable for back-pressure reactions of up to
several hundred atmospheres. The nozzles
had to have quite fine outlet openings be-
cause now the task fell upon the pump and
the nozzle alone to meter and  atomize the
fuel.

The injection pumps which Bosch wanted

to develop should match not only the re-
quirements of all the heavy-oil low-power 
engines with direct fuel injection which 
existed at the time but also future motor-
vehicle diesel engines. On 28 December 1922,
the decision was taken to embark on this
 development.

Demands on the fuel-injection pumps
The fuel-injection pump to be developed
should be capable of injecting even small
amounts of fuel with only quite small differ-
ences in the individual pump elements. 
This would facilitate smoother and more 
uniform engine operation even at low idle
speeds. For full-load requirements, the 
delivery quantity would have to be increased
by a factor of four or five. The required injec-
tion pressures were at that time already over
100 bar. Bosch demanded that these pump
properties be guaranteed over 2,000 operat-
ing hours.

These were exacting demands for the then

state-of-the-art technology. Not only did
some feats of fluid engineering have to be
achieved, but also this requirement repre-
sented a challenge in terms of production 
engineering and materials application tech-
nology.

Bosch’s emergence onto the diesel-tech-
nology stage
In 1886, Robert Bosch (1861–1942) opened a
“workshop for light and electrical engineer-
ing” in Stuttgart. He employed one other me-
chanic and an apprentice. At the beginning,
his field of work lay in installing and repair-
ing telephones, telegraphs, lightning conduc-
tors, and other light-engineering jobs.

The low-voltage magneto-ignition system

developed by Bosch had provided reliable 
ignition in gasoline engines since 1897. 
This product was the launching board for the
rapid expansion of Robert Bosch’s business.
The high-voltage magneto ignition  system
with spark plug followed in 1902. The 
armature of this ignition system is  still to 
this day incorporated in the logo of Robert
Bosch GmbH.

In 1922, Robert Bosch turned his attention
to the diesel engine. He believed that certain
accessory parts for these engines could simi-
larly make suitable objects for Bosch high-
volume precision production like magnetos
and spark plugs. The accessory parts in ques-

Development of the fuel-injection pump
Firstly, different pump designs were tried out.
Some pumps were spool-controlled, while
others were valve-controlled. The injected
fuel quantity was regulated by altering the
plunger lift. By the end of 1924, a pump de-
sign was available which, in terms of its deliv-
ery rate, its durability and its low space re-
quirement, satisfied the demands both of the
Benz precombustion-chamber engine pre-
sented at the Berlin Motor Show and of the
MAN direct-injection engine.

In March 1925, Bosch concluded contracts
with Acro AG to utilize the Acro patents on a
diesel-engine system with air chamber and
the associated injection pump and nozzle.
The Acro pump, developed by Franz Lang in
Munich, was a unique fuel- injection pump. 
It had a special valve spool with helix, which
was rotated to regulate the delivery quantity.
Lang later moved this helix to the pump
plunger.

The delivery properties of the Acro injection
pump did not match what Bosch’s own test
pumps had offered. However, with the Acro
engine, Bosch wanted to come into contact
with a diesel engine which was particularly
suitable for small cylinder units and high
speeds and in this way gain a firm foothold
for developing injection pumps and nozzles.
At the same time, Bosch was led by the idea of
granting licenses in the Acro patents to en-
gine factories to promote the spread of the
vehicle diesel engine and thereby contribute
to the motorization of traffic.

After Lang’s departure from the company

in October 1926, the focus of activity at
Bosch was again directed toward pump
 development. The first Bosch diesel fuel-
 injection pump ready for series production
appeared soon afterwards.

History of the diesel engine

Bosch diesel fuel injection

Bosch diesel fuel-injection pump ready
for series production
In accordance with the design engineer’s
plans of 1925 and like the modified Acro
pump, the Bosch fuel-injection pump fea-
tured a diagonal helix on the pump plunger.
Apart from this, however, it differed signifi-
cantly from all its predecessors. 

The external lever apparatus of the Acro
pump for rotating the pump plunger was
 replaced by the toothed control rack, which
engaged in pinions on control sleeves of the
pump elements. 

In order to relieve the load on the pressure
line at the end of the injection process and to
prevent fuel dribble, the delivery valve was
provided with a suction plunger adjusted to
fit in the valve guide. In contrast to the load-
relieving techniques previously used, this new
approach achieved increased steadiness of de-
livery at different speeds and quantity settings
and significantly simplified and shortened the

adjustment of multicylinder pumps to identi-
cal delivery by all elements.

The pump’s simple and clear design made
it easier to assemble and test. It also signifi-
cantly simplified the replacement of parts
compared with earlier designs. The housing
conformed first and foremost to the require-
ments of the foundry and other manufactur-
ing processes. The first specimens of this
Bosch fuel-injection pump really suitable for
volume production were manufactured in
April 1927. Release for production in greater
batch quantities and in versions for two-,
four- and six-cylinder engines was granted on
30 November 1927 after the specimens had
passed stringent tests at Bosch and in practi-
cal operation with flying colors.

Nozzles and nozzle holders
The development of nozzles and nozzle 
holders was conducted in parallel to pump
development. Initially, pintle nozzles were
used for precombustion-chamber engines.
Hole-type nozzles were added at the start 
of 1929 with the introduction of the Bosch
pump in the direct-injection diesel engine.

The nozzles and nozzle holders were always

adapted in terms of their size to the new
pump sizes. It was not long before the engine
manufacturers also wanted a nozzle holder
and nozzle which could be screwed into the
cylinder head in the same way as the spark
plug on a gasoline engine. Bosch adapted to
this request and started to produce screw-in
nozzle holders.

Governor for the fuel-injection pump
Because a diesel engine is not self-governing
like a gasoline engine, but needs a governor to
maintain a specific speed and to provide pro-
tection against overspeed accompanied by
self-destruction, vehicle diesel engines had to
be equipped with such devices right from the
start. The engine factories initially manufac-
tured these governors themselves. However,
the request soon came to dispense with the
drive for the governor, which was without 
exception a mechanical governor, and to
combine it with the injection pump. Bosch
complied with this request in 1931 with the
introduction of the Bosch governor.

Spread of Bosch diesel fuel-injection
technology
By August 1928, one thousand Bosch fuel-in-
jection pumps had already been supplied.
When the upturn in the fortunes of the
 vehicle diesel engine began, Bosch was well
prepared and fully able to serve the engine
factories with a full range of fuel-injection
equipment. When the Bosch pumps and noz-
zles proved their worth, most companies saw
no further need to continue manufacturing
their own accessories in this field. 

Bosch’s expertise in light engineering (e.g., 
in the manufacture of lubricating pumps)
stood it in good stead in the development 
of diesel fuel-injection pumps. Its products
could not be manufactured “in accordance
with the pure principles of mechanical 
engineering”. This helped Bosch to obtain a
market advantage. Bosch had thus made a
significant contribution towards enabling the
diesel engine to develop into what it is today.

Areas of use for diesel engines

Suitability criteria, applications

Areas of use for diesel engines

No other internal-combustion engine is as
widely used as the diesel engine 1). This is
due primarily to its high degree of efficiency
and the resulting fuel economy.

The chief areas of use for diesel engines are
(cid:2) Fixed-installation engines
(cid:2) Cars and light commercial vehicles
(cid:2) Heavy goods vehicles
(cid:2) Construction and agricultural machinery
(cid:2) Railway locomotives and
(cid:2) Ships

Diesel engines are produced as inline or 
V-configuration units. They are ideally suited
to turbocharger or supercharger aspiration as
– unlike the gasoline engine – they are not
susceptible to knocking (refer to the chapter
“Cylinder-charge control systems”).

Suitability criteria

The following features and characteristics are
significant for diesel-engine applications (ex-
amples):
(cid:2) Engine power
(cid:2) Specific power output
(cid:2) Operational safety
(cid:2) Production costs
(cid:2) Economy of operation
(cid:2) Reliability
(cid:2) Environmental compatibility
(cid:2) User-friendliness
(cid:2) Convenience (e.g. engine-compartment de-

sign)

The relative importance of these characteris-
tics affect engine design and vary according to
the type of application.

for a patent for his “New rational thermal engines”

 however, before the first functional diesel engine was
 produced at MAN in Augsburg in 1897.

for operation at that speed. An engine gover-
nor adjusts the quantity of fuel injected de-
pendent on engine load. For this type of
 application, mechanically governed fuel-
 injection systems are still used.

Cars use fast-running diesel engines capable
of speeds up to 5,500 rpm. The range of sizes
extends from 10-cylinder 5-liter units used in
large saloons to 3-cylinder 800-cc models for
small subcompacts.

Car and commercial-vehicle engines can also
be used as fixed-installation engines. How-
ever, the engine-control system may have to
be modified to suit the different  conditions.

Cars and light commercial vehicles
Car engines (Fig. 1) in particular are  expected
to produce high torque and run smoothly.
Great progress has been made in these areas
by refinements in engine design and the de-
velopment of new fuel-injection with Elec-
tronic Diesel Control (EDC). These advances
have paved the way for substantial improve-
ments in the power output and torque char-
acteristics of diesel engines since the early
1990s. And as a result, the diesel engine has
forced its way into the executive and luxury-
car markets.

In Europe, all new diesel engines are now
 Direct-Injection (DI) designs as they offer
fuel consumption reductions of 15 to 20% in
comparison with indirect-injection engines.
Such engines, now almost exclusively fitted
with turbochargers, offer considerably better
torque characteristics than comparable gaso-
line engines. The maximum torque available
to a vehicle is generally determined not by the
engine but by the power-transmission system.

The ever more stringent emission limits im-
posed and continually increasing power de-
mands require fuel-injection systems with ex-
tremely high injection pressures. Improving
emission characteristics will continue to be a
major challenge for diesel-engine developers
in the future. Consequently, further innova-
tions can be expected in the area of exhaust-
gas treatment in years to come.

Areas of use for diesel engines

Applications

Heavy goods vehicles
The prime requirement for engines for heavy
goods vehicles (Fig. 2) is economy. That is
why diesel engines for this type of application
are exclusively direct-injection (DI) designs.
They are generally medium-fast engines that
run at speeds of up to 3,500 rpm.

For large commercial vehicles too, the emis-
sion limits are continually being lowered.
That means exacting demands on the fuel-in-
jection system used and a need to develop
new emission-control systems.

Construction and agricultural machinery
Construction and agricultural machinery is
the traditional domain of the diesel engine.
The design of engines for such applications
places particular emphasis not only on econ-
omy but also on durability, reliability and
ease of maintenance. Maximizing power
 utilization and minimizing noise output 
are less important considerations than they
would be for car engines, for example. 
For this type of use, power outputs can range
from around 3 kW to the equivalent of HGV
engines.

Many engines used in construction-industry
and agricultural machines still have mechani-
cally governed fuel-injection systems. In con-
trast with all other areas of application, where
water-cooled engines are the norm, the
ruggedness and simplicity of the air-cooled
engine remain important factors in the build-
ing and farming industries.

Railway locomotives
Locomotive engines, like heavy-duty marine
diesel engines, are designed primarily with
continuous-duty considerations in mind. 
In addition, they often have to cope with
poorer quality diesel fuel. In terms of size,
they range from the equivalent of a large
truck engine to that of a medium-sized
 marine engine.

Ships
The demands placed on marine engines vary
considerably according to the particular type
of application. There are out-and-out high-
performance engines for fast naval vessels or
speedboats, for example. These tend to be 
4-stroke medium-fast engines that run at
speeds of 400...1,500 rpm and have up to
24 cylinders (Fig. 3). At the other end of

the scale there are 2-stroke heavy-duty
 engines designed for maximum economy 
in continuous duty. Such slow-running en-
gines (< 300 rpm) achieve effective levels 
of efficiency of up to 55%, which represent
the highest attainable with piston engines.

Large-scale engines are generally run on
cheap heavy oil. This requires pretreatment of
the fuel on board. Depending on quality, it
has to be heated to temperatures as high as
160°C. Only then is its viscosity reduced to a
level at which it can be filtered and pumped.

Smaller vessels often use engines originally
intended for large commercial vehicles. 
In that way, an economical propulsion unit
with low development costs can be produced.
Once again, however, the engine management
system has to be adapted to the different 
service profile.

Multi-fuel engines
For specialized applications (such as 
operation in regions with undeveloped infra-
structures or for military use), diesel engines
capable of running on a variety of different
 fuels including diesel, gasoline and others
have been developed. At present they are of
virtually no significance whatsoever within
the overall picture, as they are incapable of
meeting the current demands in respect of
emissions and performance characteristics.

Engine characteristic data

Table 1 shows the most important compari-
son data for various types of diesel and 
gasoline engine.

The average pressure in petrol engines with

direct fuel injection is around 10%
higher than for the engines listed in the table
with inlet-manifold injection. At the same
time, the specific fuel consumption is up to
25% lower. The compression ratio of such 
engines can be as much as 13:1.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Method of operation

Basic principles of the diesel engine

The diesel engine is a compression-ignition
engine in which the fuel and air are mixed in-
side the engine. The air required for combus-
tion is highly compressed inside the combus-
tion chamber. This generates high tempera-
tures which are sufficient for the diesel fuel
to spontaneously ignite when it is injected
into the cylinder. The diesel engine thus uses
heat to release the chemical energy contained
within the diesel fuel and convert it into me-
chanical force.

The diesel engine is the internal-combustion
engine that offers the greatest overall effi-
ciency (more than 50% in the case of large,
slow-running types). The associated low fuel
consumption, its low-emission exhaust and
quieter running characteristics assisted, for ex-
ample, by pre-injection have combined to give
the diesel engine its present significance.

Diesel engines are particularly suited to aspira-
tion by means of a turbocharger or super-
charger. This not only improves the engine’s
power yield and efficiency, it also reduces pollu-
tant emissions and combustion noise.

In order to reduce NOx emissions on cars and
commercial vehicles, a proportion of the ex-
haust gas is fed back into the engine’s intake

manifold (exhaust-gas recirculation). An even
greater reduction of NOx emissions can be
achieved by cooling the recirculated exhaust
gas.

Diesel engines may operate either as two-
stroke or four-stroke engines. The types used
in motor vehicles are generally four-stroke
designs.

Method of operation

A diesel engine contains one or more cylin-
ders. Driven by the combustion of the air/fuel
mixture, the piston (Fig. 1, 3) in each cylinder
(5) performs up-and-down movements. This
method of operation is why it was named the
“reciprocating-piston engine”.

The connecting rod, or conrod (11), converts
the linear reciprocating action of the piston
into rotational movement on the part of the
crankshaft (14). A flywheel (15) connected 
to the end of the crankshaft helps to maintain
continuous crankshaft rotation and reduce un-
evenness of rotation caused by the periodic na-
ture of fuel combustion in the individual
cylinders. The speed of rotation of the crank-
shaft is also referred to as engine speed.

Four-stroke cycle
On a four-stroke diesel engine (Fig. 2), inlet
and exhaust valves control the intake of air
and expulsion of burned gases after com-
bustion. They open and close the cylinder’s
inlet and exhaust ports. Each inlet and ex-
haust port may have one or two valves.

1. Induction stroke (a)
Starting from Top Dead Center (TDC), the
piston (6) moves downwards increasing the
capacity of the cylinder. At the same time
the inlet valve (3) is opened and air is drawn
into the cylinder without restriction by a
throttle valve. When the piston reaches
 Bottom Dead Center (BDC), the cylinder
capacity is at its greatest (Vh+Vc).

2. Compression stroke (b)
The inlet and exhaust valves are now closed.
The piston moves upwards and compresses
the air trapped inside the cylinder to the de-
gree determined by the engine’s compression
ratio (this can vary from 6 : 1 in large-scale
engines to 24 : 1 in car engines). In the pro -
cess, the air heats up to temperatures as high
as 900°C. When the compression stroke is
 almost complete, the fuel-injection system
injects fuel at high pressure (as much as
2,000 bar in modern engines) into the hot,
compressed air. When the piston reaches 
top dead center, the cylinder capacity is at 
its smallest (compression volume, Vc).

3. Ignition stroke (c)
After the ignition lag (a few degrees of
crankshaft rotation) has elapsed, the igni-
tion stroke (working cycle) begins. The
finely atomized and easily combustible
diesel fuel spontaneously ignites and burns
due to the heat of the compressed air in the
combustion chamber (5). As a result, the
cylinder charge heats up even more and the
pressure in the cylinder rises further as well.
The amount of energy released by combus-
tion is essentially determined by the mass 
of fuel injected (quality-based control).  
The pressure forces the  piston downwards.
The chemical energy  released by combustion
is thus converted into kinetic energy. The
crankshaft drive translates the piston’s
 kinetic energy into a turning force (torque)
available at the crankshaft.

4. Exhaust stroke (d)
Fractionally before the piston reaches bot-
tom dead center, the exhaust valve (4) opens.
The hot, pressurized gases flow out of the
cylinder. As the piston moves upwards again,
it forces the remaining exhaust gases out.

On completion of the exhaust stroke, the
crankshaft has completed two revolutions
and the four-stroke operating cycle starts
again with the induction stroke.

24

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Method of operation

Valve timing
The cams on the inlet and exhaust camshafts
open and close the inlet and exhaust valves
respectively. On engines with a single cam -
shaft, a rocker-arm mechanism transmits the
action of the cams to the valves.

Valve timing involves synchronizing the
opening and closing of the valves with the ro-
tation of the crankshaft (Fig. 4). For that rea-
son, valve timing is specified in  degrees 
of crankshaft rotation.

The crankshaft drives the camshaft by means
of a toothed belt or a chain (the timing belt
or timing chain) or sometimes by 
a series of gears. On a four-stroke engine, 
a complete operating cycle takes two revolu-
tions of the crankshaft. Therefore, the speed
of rotation of the camshaft is only half that of
the crankshaft. The transmission ratio
 between the crankshaft and the camshaft 
is thus 2 : 1.

At the changeover from exhaust to induction
stroke, the inlet and exhaust valves are open
simultaneously for a certain period 
of time. This “valve overlap” helps to “flush
out” the remaining exhaust and cool the
cylinders.

Compression
The compression ratio, ε, of a cylinder  results
from its swept volume, Vh, and its compres-
sion volume, Vc, thus:

ε =

Vh + Vc
Vc

The compression ratio of an engine has 
a decisive effect on the following:
(cid:2) The engine’s cold-starting characteristics
(cid:2) The torque generated
(cid:2) Its fuel consumption
(cid:2) How noisy it is and
(cid:2) The pollutant emissions

The compression ratio, ε, is generally between
16:1 and 24:1 in engines for cars and com-
mercial vehicles, depending on the engine de-
sign and the fuel-injection method. 
It is therefore higher than in gasoline engines
(ε = 7 : 1...13 : 1). Due to the susceptibility of
gasoline to knocking, higher compression ra-
tios and the resulting higher combustion-
chamber temperatures would cause the
air/fuel mixture to spontaneously combust in
an uncontrolled manner.

The air inside a diesel engine is compressed

to a pressure of 30...50 bar (conventionally
aspirated engine) or 70...150 bar (turbo -
charged/super charged engine). This generates
temperatures ranging from 700 to 900°C (Fig.
3). The ignition temperature of the most eas-
ily combustible components of diesel fuel is
around 250°C.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Torque and power output

25

Torque and power output

Torque
The conrod converts the linear motion 
of the piston into rotational motion of 
the crankshaft. The force with which the
 expanding air/fuel mixture forces the piston
downwards is thus translated into rotational
force or torque by the leverage of the crank-
shaft. 

The output torque M of the engine is,
therefore, dependent on mean pressure pe
(mean piston or operating pressure). 
It is expressed by the equation:
M = pe · VH / (4 · π)

where
VH is the cubic capacity of the engine and 
π ≈ 3.14.

The mean pressure can reach levels of
8...22 bar in small turbocharged diesel
 engines for cars. By comparison, gasoline en-
gines achieve levels of 7...11 bar.

The maximum achievable torque, Mmax, that
the engine can deliver is determined by its de-
sign (cubic capacity, method of aspiration,
etc.). The torque output is adjusted to the re-
quirements of the driving situation  essentially
by altering the fuel and air mass and the mix-
ing ratio.

Torque increases in relation to engine
speed, n, until maximum torque, Mmax, 
is reached (Fig. 1). As the engine speed in-
creases beyond that point, the torque begins
to fall again (maximum permissible engine
load, desired performance, gearbox design). 

Engine design efforts are aimed at generating
maximum torque at low engine speeds (un-
der 2,000 rpm) because at those speeds fuel
consumption is at its most economical and
the engine’s response characteristics 
are perceived as positive (good “pulling
power”). 

Power output
The power P (work per unit of time) gener-
ated by the engine depends on torque M and
engine speed n. Engine power output in-
creases with engine speed until it reaches its
maximum level, or rated power Prated at the
engine’s rated speed, nrated. The following
equation applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

Figure 1a shows a comparison between the
power curves of diesel engines made in 1968
and in 1998 in relation to engine speed. 

Due to their lower maximum engine speeds,
diesel engines have a lower displacement-
 related power output than gasoline engines.
Modern diesel engines for cars have rated
speeds of between 3,500 and 5,000 rpm.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Engine efficiency

Engine efficiency

The internal-combustion engine does work
by changing the pressure and volume of a
working gas (cylinder charge). 

Effective efficiency of the engine is the ratio
between input energy (fuel) and useful work.
This results from the thermal efficiency of an
ideal work process (Seiliger process) and the
percentage losses of a real process.

Seiliger process
Reference can be made to the Seiliger process
as a thermodynamic comparison process for
the reciprocating-piston engine. It describes
the theoretically useful work  under ideal 
conditions. This ideal process assumes the
following simplifications: 
(cid:2) Ideal gas as working medium
(cid:2) Gas with constant specific heat
(cid:2) No flow losses during gas exchange

The state of the working gas can be described
by specifying pressure (p) and volume (V).
Changes in state are presented in the p-V
chart (Fig. 1), where the enclosed area corre-
sponds to work that is carried out in an oper-
ating cycle. 

In the Seiliger process, the following process
steps take place:

Isentropic compression (1-2)
With isentropic compression (compression at
constant entropy, i.e. without transfer of
heat), pressure in the cylinder increases while
the volume of the gas decreases.

Isochoric heat propagation (2-3)
The air/fuel mixture starts to burn. Heat
propagation (qBV) takes place at a constant
volume (isochoric). Gas pressure also in-
creases.

Isobaric heat propagation (3-3(cid:2))
Further heat propagation (qBp) takes place 
at constant pressure (isobaric) as the piston
moves downwards and gas volume increases.

Isentropic expansion (3(cid:2)-4)
The piston continues to move downwards to
bottom dead center. No further heat transfer
takes place. Pressure drops as volume in-
creases. 

Isochoric heat dissipation (4-1)
During the gas-exchange phase, the remain-
ing heat is removed (qA). This takes place at 
a constant gas volume (completely and at
 infinite speed). The initial situation is thus 
restored and a new operating cycle begins.

p-V chart of the real process
To determine the work done in the real
process, the pressure curve in the cylinder 
is measured and presented in the p-V chart
(Fig. 2). The area of the upper curve corre-
sponds to the work present at the piston.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Engine efficiency

For assisted-aspiration engines, the gas-ex-
change area (WG) has to be added to this
since the compressed air delivered by the
turbocharger/supercharger also helps to
press the piston downwards on the induc-
tion stroke. 

Losses caused by gas exchange are over-
compensated at many operating points by
the supercharger/turbocharger, resulting in 
a positive contribution to the work done. 

Representation of pressure by means of the
crankshaft angle (Fig. 3, previous page) is
used in the thermodynamic pressure-curve
analysis, for example. 

Efficiency
Effective efficiency of the diesel engine is
 defined as:

ηe =

We
WB

We is the work effectively available at the
crankshaft.
WB is the calorific value of the fuel supplied.

Effective efficiency ηe is representable as the
product of the thermal efficiency of the ideal
process and other efficiencies that include
the influences of the real process: 

ηe = ηth · ηg · ηb · ηm = ηi · ηm

ηth: thermal efficiency 
ηth is the thermal efficiency of the Seiliger
process. This process considers heat losses
occurring in the ideal process and is mainly
dependent on compression ratio and excess-
air factor. 

As the diesel engine runs at a higher com-

pression ratio than a gasoline engine and 
a high excess-air factor, it achieves higher
 efficiency. 

ηg: efficiency of cycle factor 
ηg specifies work done in the real high-pres-
sure work process as a factor of the theoreti-
cal work of the Seiliger process.

Deviations between the real and the ideal

processes mainly result from use of a real
working gas, the finite velocity of heat prop-
agation and dissipation, the position of heat
propagation, wall heat loss, and flow losses
during the gas-exchange process. 

ηb: fuel conversion factor 
ηb considers losses occurring due to incom-
plete fuel combustion in the cylinder. 

ηm: mechanical efficiency 
ηm includes friction losses and losses arising
from driving ancillary assemblies. Frictional
and power-transmission losses increase with
engine speed. At nominal speed, frictional
losses are composed of the following: 
(cid:2) Pistons and piston rings approx. 50%
(cid:2) Bearings approx. 20%
(cid:2) Oil pump approx. 10%
(cid:2) Coolant pump approx. 5%
(cid:2) Valve-gear approx. 10%
(cid:2) Fuel-injection pump approx. 5%

If the engine has a supercharger, this must
also be included.

ηi: efficiency index 
The efficiency index is the ratio between
 “indexed” work present at the piston Wi
and the calorific value of the fuel supplied.

Work effectively available at the crankshaft
We results from indexed work taking me-
chanical losses into consideration:
We = Wi · ηm.

Operating statuses

Starting
Starting an engine involves the following
stages: cranking, ignition and running up 
to self-sustained operation. 

The hot, compressed air produced by the
compression stroke has to ignite the injected
fuel (combustion start). The minimum igni-
tion temperature required for diesel fuel is
approx. 250°C.

This temperature must also be reached 
in poor conditions. Low engine speeds, low
outside temperatures, and a cold engine lead
to relatively low final compression tempera-
tures due to the fact that: 
(cid:2) The lower the engine speed, the lower 
the ultimate pressure at the end of the
compression stroke and, accordingly, the
ultimate temperature (Fig. 1). The reasons
for this phenomenon are leakage losses
through the piston ring gaps between the
piston and the cylinder wall and the fact
that when the engine is first started, there is
no thermal expansion and an oil film has
not formed. Due to heat loss during com-

pression, maximum compression tempera-
ture is reached a few degrees before TDC
(thermodynamic loss angle, Fig. 2).

(cid:2) When the engine is cold, heat loss occurs
across the combustion-chamber surface
area during the compression stroke. On in-
direct-injection (IDI) engines, this heat loss
is particularly high due to the larger surface
area. 

(cid:2) Internal engine friction is higher at low
temperatures than at normal operating
temperature because of the higher viscosity
of the engine oil. For this reason, and also
due to low battery voltage, the starter-mo-
tor speed is only relatively low.

(cid:2) The speed of the starter motor is particu-

larly low when it is cold because the battery
voltage drops at low temperatures. 

The following measures are taken to raise
temperature in the cylinder during the start-
ing phase:

Fuel heating
A filter heater or direct fuel heater (Fig. 3 on
next page) can prevent the precipitation of
paraffin crystals that generally occurs at low

Compression pressure and ultimate temperature

temperatures (during the starting phase and
at low outside temperatures). 

Start-assist systems
The air/fuel mixture in the combustion
chamber (or in the prechamber or whirl
chamber) is normally heated by sheathed-
 element glow plugs in the starting phase on
direct-injection (DI) engines for passenger
cars, or indirect-injection engines (IDI). On
direct-injection (DI) engines for commercial
vehicles, the intake air is preheated. Both the
above methods assist fuel vaporization and
air/fuel mixing and therefore facilitate reliable
combustion of the air/fuel mixture.

Glow plugs of the latest generation require 
a preheating time of only a few seconds
(Fig. 4), thus allowing a rapid start. The lower
post-glow temperature also permits longer
post-glow times. This reduces not only harm-
ful pollutant emissions but also noise levels
during the engine’s warm-up period.

Injection adaptation
Another means of assisted starting is to inject
an excess amount of fuel for starting to com-
pensate for condensation and leakage losses
in the cold engine, and to increase  engine
torque in the running-up phase. 

Advancing the start of injection during the
warming-up phase helps to offset longer igni-
tion lag at low temperatures and to ensure re-
liable ignition at top dead center, i.e. at maxi-
mum final compression temperature. 

The optimum start of injection must be
achieved within tight tolerance limits. As the
internal cylinder pressure (compression pres-
sure) is still too low, fuel injected too early
has a greater penetration depth and precipi-
tates on the cold cylinder walls. There, only a
small proportion of it vaporizes since then
the temperature of the air charge is too low.

If the fuel is injected too late, ignition occurs
during the downward stroke (expansion
phase), and the piston is not fully accelerated,
or combustion misses occur.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Operating statuses

31

No load
No load refers to all engine operating statuses
in which the engine is overcoming only its
own internal friction. It is not producing any
torque output. The accelerator pedal may be
in any position. All speed ranges up to and
including breakaway speed are possible.

Idle
The engine is said to be idling when it is run-
ning at the lowest no-load speed. The acceler-
ator pedal is not depressed. The engine does
not produce any torque. It only overcomes its
internal friction. Some sources  refer to the
entire no-load range as idling. The upper no-
load speed (breakaway speed) is then called
the upper idle speed.

Full load
At full load (or Wide-Open Throttle (WOT)),
the accelerator pedal is fully depressed, or the
full-load delivery limit is controlled by the
engine management dependent on the oper-
ating point. The maximum possible fuel vol-
ume is injected and the engine generates its
maximum possible torque output under
steady-state conditions. Under non steady-
state conditions (limited by turbocharger/
supercharger pressure) the engine develops
the maximum possible (lower) full-load
torque with the quantity of air available. All
engine speeds from idle speed to nominal
speed are possible.

Part load
Part load covers the range between no load
and full load. The engine is generating an
output between zero and the maximum
 possible torque.

Lower part-load range
This is the operating range in which the diesel
engine’s fuel consumption is particularly 
economical in comparison with the gasoline
engine. “Diesel knock” that was a problem 
on earlier diesel engines – particularly when
cold – has virtually been eliminated on diesels
with pre-injection.

As explained in the “Starting” section, the
 final compression temperature is lower at
lower engine speeds and at lower loads. In
comparison with full load, the combustion
chamber is relatively cold (even when the 
engine is running at operating temperature)
because the energy input and, therefore, the
temperatures, are lower. After a cold start, the
combustion chamber heats up very slowly in
the lower part-load range. This  is particularly
true for engines with prechamber or whirl
chambers because the larger surface area
means that heat loss is particularly high.

At low loads and with pre-injection, only a
few mm3 of fuel are delivered in each injec-
tion cycle. In this situation, particularly high
demands are placed on the accuracy of the
start of injection and injected fuel quantity.
As during the starting phase, the required
combustion temperature is reached also at
idle speed only within a small range of piston
travel near TDC. Start of injection is con-
trolled very precisely to coincide with that
point.

During the ignition-lag period, only a small
amount of fuel may be injected since, at the
point of ignition, the quantity of fuel in the
combustion chamber determines the sudden
increase in pressure in the cylinder.

Transition between operating statuses
If the load, the engine speed, or the accelera-
tor-pedal position change, the engine’s oper-
ating state changes (e.g. its speed or torque
output).

The response characteristics of an engine can
be defined by means of characteristic data di-
agrams or maps. The map in Figure 5 shows
an example of how the engine speed changes
when the accelerator-pedal position changes
from 40% to 70% depressed. Starting from
operating point A, the new part-load operat-
ing point D is reached via the full-load curve
(B-C). There, power demand and engine
power output are equal. The engine speed 
increases from nA to nD.

The greater the increase in pressure, the
louder the combustion noise. Pre-injection 
of approx. 1 mm3 (for cars) of fuel virtually
cancels out ignition lag at the main injection
point, and thus substantially reduces combus-
tion noise. 

Overrun
The engine is said to be overrunning when it
is driven by an external force acting through
the drivetrain (e.g. when descending an
 incline). No fuel is injected (overrun fuel cut-
off). 

Steady-state operation
Torque delivered by the engine corresponds
to the torque required by the accelerator-
pedal position. Engine speed remains con-
stant.

Non-steady-state operation
The engine’s torque output does not equal the
required torque. The engine speed is not con-
stant.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Operating conditions

33

Operating conditions

In a diesel engine, the fuel is injected directly
into the highly compressed hot air which
causes it to ignite spontaneously. Therefore,
and because of the heterogeneous air/fuel
mixture, the diesel engine – in contrast with
the gasoline engine – is not restricted by ig-
nition limits (i.e. specific air-fuel ratios λ).
For this reason, at a constant air volume in
the cylinder, only the fuel quantity is con-
trolled.

The fuel-injection system must assume the
functions of metering the fuel and distribut-
ing it evenly over the entire charge. It must
accomplish this at all engine speeds and
loads, dependent on the pressure and tem-
perature of the intake air.

Thus, for any combination of engine operat-
ing parameters, the fuel-injection system
must deliver: 
(cid:2) The correct amount of fuel
(cid:2) At the correct time
(cid:2) At the correct pressure
(cid:2) With the correct timing pattern and at the
correct point in the combustion chamber

In addition to optimum air/fuel mixture
considerations, metering the fuel quantity
also requires taking account of operating
limits such as:
(cid:2) Emission restrictions (e.g. smoke emis-

sion limits)

(cid:2) Combustion-peak pressure limits
(cid:2) Exhaust temperature limits
(cid:2) Engine speed and full-load limits 
(cid:2) Vehicle or engine-specific load limits, and
(cid:2) Altitude and turbocharger/supercharger

pressure limits

Smoke limit
There are statutory limits for particulate
emissions and exhaust-gas turbidity. As a
large part of the air/fuel mixing process only
takes place during combustion, localized
over-enrichment occurs, and, in some cases,
this leads to an increase in soot-particle
emissions, even at moderate levels of excess
air. The air-fuel ratio usable at the statutory
full-load smoke limit is a measure of the
 efficiency of air utilization. 

Combustion pressure limits
During the ignition process, the partially
 vaporized fuel mixed with air burns at high
compression, at a rapid rate, and at a high

Operating conditions

initial thermal-release peak. This is referred to
as “hard” combustion. High final compres-
sion peak pressures occur during this phe-
nomenon, and the resulting forces exert
stresses on engine components and are sub-
ject to periodic changes. The dimensioning
and durability of the engine and drivetrain
components, therefore, limit the permissible
combustion pressure and, consequently, the
injected fuel quantity. The sudden rise in
combustion pressure is mostly counteracted
by pre-injection.

Exhaust-gas temperature limits
The high thermal stresses placed on the
 engine components surrounding the hot
combustion chamber, the heat resistance of
the exhaust valves and of the exhaust system
and cylinder head determine the maximum
exhaust temperature of a diesel engine.

Engine speed limits
Due to the existing excess air in the diesel en-
gine, power at constant engine speed mainly
depends on injected fuel quantity. If the
amount of fuel supplied to a diesel  engine is
increased without a corresponding increase in
the load that it is working against, then the en-
gine speed will rise. If the fuel supply is not re-
duced before the engine reaches a critical

speed, the engine may exceed its maximum
permitted engine speed, i.e. it could self-de-
struct. Consequently, an engine speed limiter
or governor is  absolutely essential on a diesel
engine. 

On diesel engines used to drive road-going
vehicles, the engine speed must be infinitely
variable by the driver using the accelerator
pedal. In addition, when the engine is under
load or when the accelerator pedal is released,
the engine speed must not be allowed to drop
below the idling speed to a standstill. This is
why a minimum-maximum-speed governor
is fitted. The speed range between these two
points is controlled using the accelerator-
pedal position. If the diesel engine is used to
drive a machine, it is expected to keep to a
specific speed constant, or remain within per-
mitted limits, irrespective of load. A variable-
speed governor is then fitted to control speed
across the entire range.

A program map is definable for the engine
operating range. This map (Fig. 1, previous
page) shows the fuel quantity in relation to
engine speed and load, and the necessary ad-
justments for temperature and air-pressure
variations.

Altitude and turbocharger/supercharger
pressure limits
The injected fuel quantity is usually designed
for sea level. If the engine is operated at high
elevations (height above mean sea level), the
fuel quantity must be adjusted in relation to
the drop in air pressure in order to comply
with smoke limits. A standard value is the
barometric elevation formula, i.e. air density
decreases by approximately 7% per 1,000 m of
elevation.

With turbocharged engines, the cylinder
charge in dynamic operation is often lower
than in static operation. Since the maximum
injected fuel quantity is designed for static
operation, it must be reduced in dynamic op-
eration in line with the lower air-flow rate
(full-load limited by charge-air pressure).

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Fuel-injection system

35

Fuel-injection system

The low-pressure fuel supply conveys fuel
from the fuel tank and delivers it to the fuel-
injection system at a specific supply pressure.
The fuel-injection pump generates the fuel
pressure required for injection. In most sys-
tems, fuel runs through high-pressure
 delivery lines to the injection nozzle and is in-
jected into the combustion chamber at 
a pressure of 200...2,200 bar on the nozzle
side.

Engine power output, combustion noise, and
exhaust-gas composition are mainly
 influenced by the injected fuel mass, the
 injection point, the rate of discharge, and the
combustion process.

Up to the 1980s, fuel injection, i.e. the in-
jected fuel quantity and the start of injection
on vehicle engines, was mostly controlled me-
chanically. The injected fuel quantity is then
varied by a piston timing edge or via slide
valves, depending on load and engine speed.
Start of injection is adjusted by mechanical
control using flyweight governors, or hy-
draulically by pressure control (see  section
entitled “Overview of diesel fuel- injection
systems”).

Now electronic control has fully replaced me-
chanical control – not only in the automotive
sector. Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) man-
ages the fuel-injection process by involving
various parameters, such as engine speed,
load, temperature, geographic  elevation, etc.
in the calculation. Start of injection and fuel
injection quantity are controlled by solenoid
valves, a process that is much more precise
than mechanical control.

(cid:4)

Size of injection

An engine developing 75 kW (102 HP) and 
a specific fuel consumption of 200 g/kWh 
(full load) consumes 15 kg fuel per hour. On a
4-stroke 4-cylinder engine, the fuel is distrib-
uted by 288,000 injections at 2,400 revs per
minute. This results in a fuel volume of approx.
60 mm3 per injection. By comparison, a rain-
drop has a volume of approximately 30 mm3.

Even greater precision in metering requires an
idle with approx. 5 mm3 fuel per injection and a
pre-injection of only 1 mm3. Even the minutest
variations have a negative effect on the

smooth running of the engine, noise, and pol-
lutant emissions. 

The fuel-injection system not only has to deliver
precisely the right amount of fuel for each indi-
vidual, it also has to distribute the fuel evenly to
the individual cylinder of an engine. Electronic
Diesel Control (EDC) adapts the injected fuel
quantity for each cylinder in order to achieve 
a particularly smooth-running engine.

36

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Combustion chambers

Combustion chambers

The shape of the combustion chamber is one
of the decisive factors in determining the
quality of combustion and therefore the per-
formance and exhaust characteristics of 
a diesel engine. Appropriate design of com-
bustion-chamber geometry combined with
the action of the piston can produce whirl,
squish, and turbulence effects that are used to
improve distribution of the liquid fuel or
air/fuel vapor spray inside of the combustion
chamber.

The following technologies are used: 
(cid:2) Undivided combustion chamber (Direct

Injection (DI) engines) and

(cid:2) Divided combustion chamber (Indirect In-

jection (IDI) engines)

The proportion of direct-injection engines 
is increasing due to their more economical
fuel consumption (up to 20% savings). 
The harsher combustion noise (particularly
under acceleration) can be reduced to the
level of indirect-injection engines by pre-in-
jection. Engines with divided combustion
chambers now hardly figure at all among new
developments.

1

Direct injection

Undivided combustion chamber 
(direct-injection engines)
Direct-injection engines (Fig. 1) have a higher
level of efficiency and operate more economi-
cally than indirect-injection engines. Accord-
ingly, they are used in all types of commercial
vehicles and most modern diesel cars.

As the name suggests, the direct-injection
process involves injecting the fuel directly
into the combustion chamber, part of which
is formed by the shape of the piston crown
(piston crown recess, 2). Fuel atomization,
heating, vaporization and mixing with the air
must therefore take place in rapid succession.
This places exacting demands on fuel and air
delivery. During the induction and compres-
sion strokes, the special shape of the intake
port in the cylinder head creates an air vortex
inside of the cylinder. The shape of the com-
bustion chamber also contributes to the air
flow pattern at the end of the compression
stroke (i.e. at the moment of fuel injection).
Of the combustion chamber  designs used
over the history of the diesel engine, the most
widely used at present is the ω piston crown
recess.

In addition to creating effective air turbu-
lence, the technology must also ensure that
fuel is delivered in such a way that it is evenly
distributed throughout the combustion
chamber to achieve rapid mixing. A multi-
hole nozzle is used in the direct-injection
process and its nozzle-jet position is opti-
mized as a factor of combustion-chamber de-
sign. Direct fuel injection requires very high
injection pressures (up to 2,200 bar).

In practice, there are two types of direct

fuel injection:
(cid:2) Systems in which mixture formation is
 assisted by specifically created air-flow
 effects and

(cid:2) Systems which control mixture formation
virtually exclusively by means of fuel injec-
tion and largely dispense with any air-flow
effects

In the latter case, no effort is expended in cre-
ating air-turbulence effects and this is  evident
in smaller gas replacement losses and more
effective cylinder charging. At the same time,
however, far more demanding requirements
are placed on the fuel-injection system with
regard to injection-nozzle positioning, the
number of nozzle jets, the degree of atomiza-
tion (dependent on spray-hole diameter), and
the intensity of injection pressure in order to
obtain the required short injection times and
quality of the air/fuel mixture.

Divided combustion chamber 
(indirect injection)
For a long time diesel engines with divided
combustion chambers (indirect-injection en-
gines) held an advantage over direct- injection
engines in terms of noise and  exhaust-gas
emissions. That was the reason why they were
used in cars and light commercial vehicles.
Now direct-injection engines are more eco-
nomical than IDI engines, with comparable
noise emissions as a result of their high injec-
tion pressures, electronic diesel control, and
pre-injection. As a result, indirect-injection
engines are no longer used in new vehicles.

There are two types of processes with  divided
combustion chamber:
(cid:2) The precombustion chamber system and 
(cid:2) The whirl-chamber system

Precombustion chamber system
In the prechamber (or precombustion cham-
ber) system, fuel is injected into a hot
prechamber recessed into the cylinder head
(Fig. 2, 2). The fuel is injected through a pin-
tle nozzle (1) at a relatively low pressure (up
to 450 bar). A specially shaped baffle (3) in
the center of the chamber diffuses the jet of
fuel that strikes it and mixes it thoroughly
with the air. 

Combustion starting in the prechamber
 drives the partly combusted air/fuel mixture
through the connecting channel (4) into 
the main combustion chamber. Here and fur-
ther down the combustion process, the in-
jected fuel is mixed intensively with the exist-
ing air. The ratio of precombustion chamber
volume to main combustion chamber volume
is approx. 1 : 2.

2

Precombustion chamber system 

The short ignition lag 1) and the gradual re-
lease of energy produce a soft combustion ef-
fect with low levels of noise and engine load. 

1)

Time from start of
 injection to start of
ignition

A differently shaped prechamber with an
evaporation recess and a different shape and
position of the baffle (spherical pin) apply a
specific degree of whirl to the air that passes
from the cylinder into the prechamber during
the compression stroke. The fuel is injected at
an angle of 5 degrees in relation 
to the prechamber axis.

So as not to disrupt the progression of com-
bustion, the glow plug (5) is positioned on
the “lee side” of the air flow. A controlled
post-glow period of up to 1 minute after a
cold start (dependent on coolant tempera-
ture) helps to improve exhaust-gas character-
istics and reduce engine noise during the
warm-up period.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Combustion chambers

It is important that mixture formation takes
place as completely as possible inside the
swirl chamber. The shape of the swirl cham-
ber, the alignment and shape of the fuel jet
and the position of the glow plug must be
carefully matched to the engine in order to
obtain optimum mixture formation at all en-
gine speeds and under all operating condi-
tions.

Another demand is for rapid heating of the
swirl chamber after a cold start. This reduces
ignition lag and combustion noise as well as
preventing unburned hydrocarbons (blue
smoke) during the warm-up period.

3

Swirl-chamber system

Swirl-chamber system
With this process, combustion is also initiated
in a separate chamber (swirl chamber) that
has approx. 60% of the compression volume.
The spherical and disk-shaped swirl chamber
is linked by a connecting channel that dis-
charges at a tangent into the cylinder cham-
ber (Fig. 3, 2).

During the compression cycle, air entering
via the connecting channel is set into a
swirling motion. The fuel is injected so that
the swirl penetrates perpendicular to its axis
and meets a hot section of the chamber wall
on the opposite side of the chamber.

As soon as combustion starts, the air/fuel
mixture is forced under pressure through the
connecting channel into the cylinder cham-
ber where it is turbulently mixed with the re-
maining air. With the swirl-chamber system,
the losses due to gas flow between the main
combustion chamber and the swirl chamber
are less than with the precombustion cham-
ber system because the connecting channel
has a larger cross-section. This results in
smaller throttle-effect losses and consequent
benefits for internal efficiency and fuel con-
sumption. However, combustion noise is
louder than with the precombustion chamber
system.

(cid:4)

M System

In the direct-injection system with recess-wall
deposition (M system) for commercial-vehicle
and fixed-installation diesel engines and multi-
fuel engines, a single-jet nozzle sprays the fuel
at a low injection pressure against the wall of
the piston crown recess. There, it vaporizes
and is absorbed by the air. This system thus
uses the heat of the piston recess wall to
 vaporize the fuel. If the air flow inside of the
combustion chamber is properly adapted, an
extremely homogeneous air/fuel mixture with a

long combustion period, low pressure increase
and, therefore, quiet combustion can be
achieved. Due to its consumption disadvan-
tages compared with the air-distributing 
direct injection
process, the 
M system is 
no longer used 
in modern appli-
cations.

Fuel consumption in everyday practice

Automotive manufacturers are obliged
by law to specify the fuel consumption
of their vehicles. This figure is deter-
mined from the exhaust-gas emissions
during the exhaust-gas test when the
vehicle travels a specific route profile
(test cycle). The fuel consumption fig-
ures are therefore comparable for all
 vehicles. 

Every driver makes a significant con-

tribution to reducing fuel consumption
by his or her driving style. Reducing the
fuel consumption that the driver can
achieve with a vehicle depends on
 several factors. 

Applying the measures listed below, 
an “economical” driver can reduce fuel
consumption in everyday traffic by 20 
to 30% compared to an average driver.
The reduction in fuel consumption
achievable by applying the individual
measures depends on a number of
 factors, mainly the route profile (city
streets, overland roads), and on traffic
conditions. For this reason, it is not
 always practical to specify figures for
fuel-consumption savings. 

Positive influences on fuel consumption
(cid:2) Tire pressure: Remember to increase tire pressure when the vehicle is carrying a full payload

(cid:2) When accelerating at high load and low engine speed, shift up at 2,000 rpm.

2,000 rpm. 

(cid:2) Avoid braking and re-accelerating by adopting a forward-looking style of driving.
(cid:2) Use overrun fuel cutoff to the full.
(cid:2) Switch off the engine when the vehicle is stopped for an extended period of time, e.g. at traffic
lights with a long red phase, or at closed railroad crossings (3 minutes at idle consumes as
much fuel as driving 1 km).

(cid:2) Use high-lubricity engine oils (saving: approx. 2% according to manufacturer specifications).

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

The combustion processes in the diesel 
engine, also linked to engine performance,
fuel consumption, exhaust-gas composition,
and combustion noise, depend to a great 
extent on how the air/fuel mixture is 
prepared. 

The fuel-injection parameters that are deci-
sive on the quality of the mixture formation
are primarily:
(cid:2) start of injection
(cid:2) rate-of-discharge curve and injection

 duration

(cid:2) injection pressure
(cid:2) number of injection events

On the diesel engine, exhaust-gas and noise
emissions are largely reduced by measures 
inside of the engine, i.e. combustion-process
control.

Until the 1980s injected fuel quantity and
start of injection were controlled on vehicle
engines by mechanical means only. However,
compliance with prevailing emission limits
requires the high-precision adjustment of 
injection parameters, e.g. pre-injection, main
injection, injected fuel quantity, injection
pressure, and start of injection, adapted to 
the engine operating state. This is only
achievable using an electronic control unit
that calculates injection parameters as 
a factor of temperature, engine speed, load,
altitude (elevation), etc. Electronic Diesel
Control (EDC) has generally become wide-
spread on diesel engines.

As exhaust-gas emission standards become
more severe in future, further measures for
minimizing pollutants will have to be intro-
duced. Emissions, as well as combustion
noise, can continue to be reduced by means
of very high injection pressures, as achieved
by the Unit Injector System, and by a rate-
of-discharge curve that is adjustable indepen-
dent of pressure buildup, as implemented by
the common-rail system.

Mixture distribution

Excess-air factor λ
The excess-air factor λ (lambda) was intro-
duced to indicate the degree by which the 
actual air/fuel mixture actually deviates from
the stoichiometric1) mass ratio. It indicates
the ratio of intake air mass to required air
mass for stoichiometric combustion, thus:

λ =

Air mass
Fuel mass · Stoichiometric ratio

λ = 1: The intake air mass is equal to the air
mass theoretically required to burn all of the
fuel injected. 

λ < 1: The intake air mass is less than the
amount required and therefore the mixture is
rich. 

λ > 1: The intake air mass is greater than the
amount required and therefore the mixture is
lean.

1) The stoichiometric ratio indicates the air mass in kg
 required to completely burn 1 kg of fuel (mL/mK). 
For diesel fuel, this is approx. 14.5.

Lambda levels in diesel engines
Rich areas of mixture are responsible for
sooty combustion. In order to prevent the
formation of too many rich areas of mixture,
diesel engines – in contrast to gasoline en-
gines – have to be run with an overall  excess
of air.

The lambda levels for turbocharged diesel
engines at full load are between λ = 1.15 and
λ = 2.0. When idling and under no-load con-
ditions, those figures rise to λ >10.

These excess-air factors represent the ratio of
total masses of fuel and air in the cylinder.
However, the lambda factor, which is subject
to strong spatial fluctuation, is primarily 
responsible for auto-ignition and the produc-
tion of pollutants.

Diesel engines operate with heterogeneous
mixture formation and auto-ignition. It is not
possible to achieve completely homogeneous
mixing of the injected fuel with the air charge
prior to or during combustion. Within the
heterogeneous mixture encountered in a
diesel engine, the localized excess-air factors
can cover the entire range from λ = 0 (pure
fuel) in the eye of the jet close to the injector
to λ = ∞ (pure air) at the outer extremities of
the spray jet. Around the outer zone of a sin-
gle liquid droplet (vapor envelope), there are
localized lambda levels of 0.3 to 1.5 (Figs. 2
and 3). From this, it can be deduced that op-
timized atomization (large numbers of very

small droplets), high levels of excess air, and
“metered” motion of the air charge produce
large numbers of localized zones with lean,
combustible lambda levels. This results in 
less soot occurring during combustion.
EGR compatibility then rises, and NOx
emissions are reduced.

Optimized fuel atomization is achieved by
high injection pressures that range up to max.
2,200 bar for UIS. Common-rail systems
(CRS) operate at an injection pressure of
max. 1,800 bar. This results is a high relative
velocity between the jet of fuel and the air in
the cylinder which has the effect of scattering
the fuel jet.

With a view to reducing engine weight and
cost, the aim is to obtain as much power 
as possible from a given engine capacity. 
To achieve this, the engine must run on 
the lowest possible excess air at high loads. 
On the other hand, a deficiency in excess 
air increases the amount of soot emissions.
Therefore, soot has to be limited by precisely
metering the injected fuel quantity to match
the available air mass as a factor of engine
speed.

Low atmospheric pressures (e.g. at high 
altitudes) also require the fuel volume to be
adjusted to the smaller amount of available
air.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Fuel-injection parameters

Start of injection and delivery
Start of injection
The point at which injection of fuel into the
combustion chamber starts has a decisive
 effect on the point at which combustion of
the air/fuel mixture starts, and therefore on
emission levels, fuel consumption and com-
bustion noise. For this reason, start of injec-
tion plays a major role in optimizing engine
performance characteristics.

Start of injection specifies the position stated
in degrees of crankshaft rotation relative to
crankshaft Top Dead Center (TDC) at 
which the injection nozzle opens, and fuel 
is injected into the engine combustion 
chamber.

The position of the piston relative to top
dead center at that moment influences the
flow of air inside of the combustion chamber,
as well as air density and temperature. Ac-
cordingly, the degree of mixing of air and fuel
is also dependent on start of injection. Thus,

start of injection affects emissions such as
soot, nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned 
hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide
(CO).

The start-of-injection setpoints vary accord-
ing to engine load, speed, and temperature.
Optimized values are determined for each 
engine, taking into consideration the impacts
on fuel consumption, pollutant emission, 
and noise. These values are then stored in a
start-of-injection program map (Fig. 4).
Load-dependent start-of-injection variability
is controlled across the program map.

Compared with cam-controlled systems,
common-rail systems offer more freedom in 
selecting the quantity and timing of injection
events and injection pressure. As a consequence,
fuel pressure is built up by a separate high-pres-
sure pump, optimized to every operating point
by the engine management system, and fuel 
injection is controlled by a solenoid valve or
piezoelectric element.

Standard values for start of injection
On a diesel-engine data map, the optimum
points of combustion start for low fuel con-
sumption are in the range of 0...8° crankshaft
angle before TDC. As a result, and based on
statutory exhaust-gas emission limits, the
start of injection points are as  follows:

Retarded start of injection
A retarded start of injection at low-load con-
ditions can result in incomplete combustion
and, therefore, in the emission of unburned
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide
(CO) since the temperature in the combustion
chamber is already dropping (Fig. 5).

Direct-injection car engines:
(cid:2) No load: 2° crankshaft angle before TDC to

4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:2) Part load: 6° crankshaft angle before TDC

to 4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:2) Full load: 6 to 15° crankshaft angle before

TDC

TDC

Direct-injection commercial-vehicle engines 
(without exhaust-gas recirculation):
(cid:2) No load: 4 to 12° crankshaft angle before

(cid:2) Full load: 3 to 6° crankshaft angle before
TDC to 2° crankshaft angle after TDC

When the engine is cold, the start of injection
for car and commercial-vehicle engines is 3 to
10° earlier. Combustion time at full load is 40
to 60° crankshaft angle.

Advanced start of injection
The highest compression temperature (final
compression temperature) occurs shortly
 before piston Top Dead Center (TDC). If com-
bustion starts a long way before TDC, combus-
tion pressure rises steeply, and acts 
as a retarding force against the piston stroke.
Heat lost in the process diminishes engine
 efficiency and, therefore, increases fuel con-
sumption. The steep rise in compression pres-
sure also makes combustion much noisier.
An advanced start of injection increases
temperature in the combustion chamber. 
As a result, NOx emission levels rise, but 
HC emissions are lower (Fig. 5).

Minimizing blue and white smoke levels
 requires advanced start of injection and/or
pre-injection when the engine is cold.

The partially conflicting tradeoffs of specific
fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions
on the one hand, and soot (black smoke) and
NOx emissions on the other,  demand com-
promises and very tight tolerances when
modifying the start of injection to suit a par-
ticular engine.

Start of delivery
In addition to start of injection, start of
 delivery is another aspect that is often consid-
ered. It relates to the point at which the fuel-
injection pump starts to deliver fuel to the in-
jector.

On older fuel-injection systems, start of de-

livery plays an important role since the in-
line or distributor injection pump must be al-
located to the engine. The relative timing be-
tween pump and engine is fixed at start of de-
livery, since this is easier to define than the
actual start of injection. This is made possible
because there is a definite relationship be-
tween start of delivery and start of injection
(injection lag 1)).

Injection lag results from the time it takes

the pressure wave to travel from the high-
pressure pump through to the injection noz-
zle. Therefore, it depends on the length of the
line. At different engine speeds, there is a dif-
ferent injection lag measured as a crankshaft
angle (degrees of crankshaft rotation). At
higher engine speeds, the engine has a greater
ignition lag 2) related to the crankshaft posi-
tion (in degrees of crankshaft angle). Both of
these effects must be compensated for –
which is why a fuel-injection system must be
able to adjust the start of delivery/start of in-
jection in response to engine speed, load, and
temperature.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Injected-fuel quantity
The required fuel mass, me, for an engine
cylinder per power stroke is calculated using
the following equation:

me =

P · be · 33.33
n · z

[mg/stroke]

where:
P engine power in kilowatts
be engine specific fuel

consumption in g/kWh

n engine speed in rpm 
z number of engine cylinders

Injection duration
One of the main parameters of the rate-of-
discharge curve is injection duration. During
this period, the injection nozzle is open, and
fuel flows into the combustion chamber. This
parameter is specified in degrees of crank-
shaft or camshaft angle, or in milli seconds.
Different diesel combustion processes require
different injection durations, as  illustrated by
the following examples  (approximate figures
at rated output):
(cid:2) Passenger-car direct-injection (DI) engine 

approx. 32...38° crankshaft angle

(cid:2) Indirect-injection car engines: 35...40° 

The corresponding fuel volume (injected fuel
quantity), QH, in mm3/stroke or mm3/injec-
tion cycle is then:

crankshaft angle

(cid:2) Direct-injection commercial-vehicle
engines: 25...36° crankshaft angle 

A crankshaft angle of 30° during injection
duration is equivalent to a camshaft angle 
of 15°. This results in an injection pump
speed 1) of 2,000 rpm, equivalent to an injec-
tion duration of 1.25 ms.

In order to minimize fuel consumption and
emissions, the injection duration must be de-
fined as a factor of the operating point and
start of injection (Figs. 6 through 9).

1) Equivalent to half the engine speed on four-stroke engines

QH =

P · be · 1,000
30 · n · z · (cid:3)

[mm3/stroke]

Fuel density, (cid:3), in g/cm3 is temperature-
 dependent.

Engine power output at an assumed con-
stant level of efficiency (η~1/be) is directly
proportional to the injected fuel quantity.

The fuel mass injected by the fuel-injection
system depends on the following variables:
(cid:2) The fuel-metering cross-section of the

 injection nozzle

(cid:2) The injection duration
(cid:2) The variation over time of the difference
between the injection pressure and the
pressure in the combustion chamber

(cid:2) The density of the fuel

Diesel fuel is compressible, i.e it is com-
pressed at high pressures. This increases 
the injected fuel quantity. The deviation be-
tween the setpoint quantity in the program
map and the actual quantity impacts on per-
formance and pollutant emissions. In high-
precision fuel-injection systems controlled by
electronic diesel control, the required  injected
fuel quantity can be metered with 
a high degree of accuracy.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Rate-of-discharge curve
The rate-of-discharge curve describes the
fuel-mass flow plotted against time when in-
jected into the combustion chamber  during
the injection duration.

Rate-of-discharge curve on cam-controlled
fuel-injection systems
On cam-controlled fuel-injection systems,
pressure is built up continuously throughout
the injection process by the fuel-injection
pump. Thus, the speed of the pump has a 
direct impact on fuel delivery rate and, 
consequently, on injection pressure.

Port-controlled distributor and in-line
fuel-injection pumps do not permit any  
pre-injection. With two-spring nozzle-and-
holder assemblies, however, the injection rate
can be reduced at the start of injection to 
improve combustion noise.

Pre-injection is also possible with sole-
noid-valve controlled distributor injection
pumps. Unit Injector Systems (UIS) for
 passenger cars are equipped with hydro -
mechanical pre-injection, but its control 
is only limited in time.

Pressure generation and delivery of the
 injected fuel quantity are interlinked by 
the cam and the injection pump in cam-
controlled systems. This has the following 
impacts on injection characteristics:

(cid:2) Injection pressure rises as engine speed and
injected fuel quantity increase, and until
maximum pressure is reached (Fig. 10).

(cid:2) Injection pressure rises at the start of 

injection, but drops back to nozzle-closing
pressure before the end of injection (start-
ing at end of delivery).

The consequences of this are as follows:
(cid:2) Small injected fuel quantities are injected 

at lower pressure.

(cid:2) The rate-of-discharge curve is approxi-

mately triangular in shape.

This triangular curve promotes combustion
in part-load and at low engine speeds since it
achieves a shallower rise, and thus quieter
combustion; however, this curve is less bene-
ficial at full-load as a square curve achieves
better air efficiency.

On indirect-injection engines (engines
with prechamber or whirl chambers), throt-
tling-pintle nozzles are used to produce a sin-
gle jet of fuel and define the rate-of-discharge
curve. This type of injection nozzle controls
the outlet cross-section as a function of nee-
dle lift. It produces a gradual  increase in pres-
sure and, consequently, “quiet combustion”.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

47

Since the electronic control unit triggers the
injectors, start of injection, injection dura-
tion, and injection pressure are freely defin-
able for the various engine operating points
in an engine application. They are controlled
by Electronic Diesel Control (EDC). EDC
balances out injected-fuel-quantity spread in
individual injectors by means of injector de-
livery compensation (IMA).

Modern piezoelectric common-rail fuel-in-
jection systems permit several pre-injection
and secondary injection events. In fact, up 
to five injection events are possible during 
a power cycle.

Rate-of-discharge curve in the
common-rail system
A high-pressure pump generates the fuel-rail
pressure independently of the injection cycle.
Injection pressure during the injection
process is virtually constant (Fig. 11). At a
given system pressure, the injected fuel quan-
tity is proportional to the length of time the
injector is open, and it is independent of en-
gine or pump speed (time-based injection).

This results in an almost square rate-of-dis-
charge curve which intensifies with short in-
jection durations and the almost constant,
high spray velocities at full-load, thus permit-
ting higher specific power outputs.

However, this is not beneficial to combustion
noise since a large quantity of fuel is  injected
during ignition lag because of the high injec-
tion rate at the start of injection. This leads to
a high pressure rise during  premixed com-
bustion. As it is possible 
to  exclude up to two pre-injection events, 
the combustion chamber can be precon -
ditioned. This shortens ignition lag and
achieves the lowest possible noise emissions.

Injection functions
Depending on the application for which the
engine is intended, the following injection
functions are required (Fig. 12):
(cid:2) Pre-injection (1) reduces combustion noise

and NOx emissions, in particular 
on DI engines.

(cid:2) Positive-pressure gradient during the main
injection event (3) reduces NOx emissions
on engines without exhaust-gas recircula-
tion.

(cid:2) Two-stage pressure gradient (4) during 
the main injection event reduces NOx
and soot emissions on engines without ex-
haust-gas recirculation.

(cid:2) Constant high pressure during the main in-
jection event (3, 7) reduces soot emissions
when operating the engine with exhaust-
gas recirculation.

(cid:2) Advanced secondary injection (8) reduces

soot emissions.

(cid:2) Retarded secondary injection (9).

Pre-injection
The pressure and temperature levels in the
cylinder at the point of main injection rise 
 if a small fuel quantity (approx. 1 mg) is
burned during the compression phase. This
shortens the ignition lag of the main injection
event and has a positive impact on combus-
tion noise, since the proportion of fuel in the

13

Effect of pre-injection on combustion-pressure 
pattern

premixed combustion process decreases. At
the same time the quantity of diffuse fuel
combusted increases. This increases soot and
NOx emissions, also due to the higher temper-
ature prevailing in the cylinder.

On the other hand, the higher combustion-
chamber temperatures are favorable mainly at
cold start and in the low load range in order
to stabilize combustion and reduce HC and
CO emissions.

A good compromise between combustion

noise and NOx emissions is obtainable by
adapting the time interval between pre-injec-
tion and main injection dependent on 
the operating point, and metering the pre-in-
jected fuel quantity.

Retarded secondary injection
With retarded secondary injection, fuel is 
not combusted, but is evaporated by residual
heat in the exhaust gas. The secondary-injec-
tion phase follows the main-injection phase
during the expansion or exhaust stroke at a
point up to 200° crankshaft angle after TDC.
It injects a precisely metered quantity of fuel
into the exhaust gas. The resulting mixture of
fuel and exhaust gas is expelled through the
exhaust ports into the exhaust-gas system
during the exhaust stroke.

Retarded secondary injection is mainly
used to supply hydrocarbons which also cause
an increase in exhaust-gas temperature by ox-
idation in an oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter. This measure is used to regenerate
downstream exhaust-gas treatment systems,
such as particulate filters or NOx accumula-
tor-type catalytic converters.

Since retarded secondary injection may
cause thinning of the engine oil by the diesel
fuel, it needs clarification with the engine
manufacturer. 

Advanced secondary injection
On the common-rail system, secondary injec-
tion can occur directly after main injection
while combustion is still taking place. In this
way, soot particles are reburned, and soot
emissions can be reduced by 20 to 70%.

Timing characteristics of fuel-injection
 systems
Figure 14 presents an example of a radial-pis-
ton distributor pump (VP44). The cam on
the cam ring starts delivery, and fuel then ex-
its from the nozzle. It shows that pressure and
injection patterns vary greatly between the
pump and the nozzle, and are determined by
the characteristics of the components that
control injection (cam, pump, high-pressure
valve, fuel line, and nozzle). For this reason,
the fuel-injection system must be precisely
matched to the engine.

The characteristics are similar for all fuel-
injection systems in which pressure is gener-
ated by a pump plunger (in-line injection
pumps, unit injectors, and unit pumps).

Detrimental volume in conventional  injection
systems
The term “detrimental volume” refers to the
volume of fuel on the high-pressure side of
the fuel-injection system. This is made up of
the high-pressure side of the fuel-injection
pump, the high-pressure fuel lines, and the
volume of the nozzle-and-holder assembly.
Every time fuel is injected, the detrimental
volume is pressurized and depressurized. As a
result, compression losses occur, thus retard-
ing injection lag. The fuel volume inside of
the pipes is compressed by the dynamic
processes generated by the pressure wave.

The greater the detrimental volume, the
poorer the hydraulic efficiency of the fuel-in-
jection system. A major consideration when
developing a fuel-injection system is, there-
fore, to minimize detrimental volume as
much as possible. The unit injector system
has the smallest detrimental volume.

In order to guarantee uniform control of
the engine, the detrimental volume must be
equal for all cylinders.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

The fuel must be injected at high pressure
due to low air flow. Modern direct-injection
systems now generate full-load peak pressures
of 1,000...2,050 bar for car engines, and
1,000...2,200 bar for commercial vehicles.
However, peak pressure is available only 
at higher engine speeds – except on the 
common-rail system.

A decisive factor to obtain an ideal torque
curve with low-smoke operation (i.e. with 
low particulate emission) is a relatively high
injection pressure adapted to the combustion
process at low full-load engine speeds. Since
the air density in the cylinder is relatively low
at low engine speeds, injection pressure must
be limited to avoid depositing fuel on the
cylinder wall. Above about 2,000 rpm, the
maximum charge-air pressure becomes 
available, and injection pressure can rise to
maximum.

To obtain ideal engine efficiency, fuel must 
be injected within a specific, engine-speed-
dependent angle window on either side of
TDC. At high engine speeds (rated output),
therefore, high injection pressures are re-
quired to shorten the injection duration.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
On diesel engines with divided combustion
chambers, rising combustion pressure expels
the charge out of the prechamber or whirl
chamber into the main combustion chamber.
This process runs at high air velocities in the
whirl chamber, in the connecting  passage 
between the whirl chamber, and the main
combustion chamber.

Injection pressure
The process of fuel injection uses pressure 
in the fuel system to induce the flow of fuel
through the injector jets. A high fuel-system
pressure results in a high rate of fuel outflow
at the injection nozzle. Fuel atomization is
caused by the collision of the turbulent jet 
of fuel with the air inside of the combustion
chamber. Therefore, the higher the relative
velocity between fuel and air, and the higher
the density of the air, the more finely the fuel
is atomized. The injection pressure at the
nozzle may be higher than in the fuel-
 injection pump because of the length of 
the high-pressure fuel line, whose length 
is matched to the reflected pressure wave.

Direct-injection (DI) engines
On diesel engines with direct injection, the
velocity of the air inside of the combustion
chamber is relatively slow since it only moves
as a result of its mass moment of inertia
(i.e. the air “attempts” to maintain the velocity
at which it enters the cylinder; this causes
whirl). The piston stroke intensifies whirl in
the cylinder since the restricted flow forces
the air into the piston recess, and thus into a
smaller diameter. In general, however, air mo-
tion is less and in indirect-injection engines.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Nozzle and nozzle holder designs

51

Nozzle and nozzle holder
 designs

Secondary injection
Unintended secondary injection has a par-
ticularly undesirable effect on exhaust-gas
quality. Secondary injection occurs when the
injection nozzle shortly re-opens after clos-
ing and allows poorly conditioned fuel to 
be injected into the cylinder at a late stage 
in the combustion process. This fuel is not
completely burned, or may not be burned 
at all, with the result that it is released into
the exhaust gas as unburned hydrocarbons.
This undesirable effect can be prevented by
rapidly closing nozzle-and-holder assem-
blies, at sufficiently high closing pressure
and low static pressure in the supply line.

Dead volume
Dead volume in the injection nozzle on the
cylinder side of the needle-seal seats has a
similar effect to secondary injection. The
fuel accumulated in such a volume runs into
the combustion chamber on completion of
combustion, and partly escapes into the ex-
haust pipe. This fuel component similarly
increases the level of unburned hydrocar-
bons in the exhaust gas (Fig. 1). Sac-less

(vco) nozzles, in which the injection orifices
are drilled into the needle-seal seats, have
the smallest dead volume.

Injection direction 
Direct-injection (DI) engines
Diesel engines with direct injection generally
have hole-type nozzles with between 4 and
10 injection orifices (most commonly 6 to 8
injection orifices) arranged as centrally as
possible. The injection direction is very pre-
cisely matched to the combustion chamber.
Divergences of the order of only 2 degrees
from the optimum injection direction lead
to a detectable increase in soot emission and
fuel consumption.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
Indirect-injection engines use pintle nozzles
with only a single injection jet. The nozzle
injects the fuel into the precombustion or
whirl chamber in such a way that the glow
plug is just within the injection jet. The in-
jection direction is matched precisely to the
combustion chamber. Any deviations in in-
jection direction result in poorer utilization
of combustion air and, therefore, to an in-
crease in soot and hydrocarbon emissions.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Method of operation

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

The gasoline or spark-ignition (SI) internal-
combustion engine uses the Otto cycle 1)
and externally supplied ignition. It burns an
air/fuel mixture and in the process converts
the chemical energy in the fuel into kinetic
energy. 

For many years, the carburetor was respon-
sible for providing an air/fuel mixture in the
intake manifold which was then drawn into
the cylinder by the downgoing piston. 

The breakthrough of gasoline fuel injec-
tion, which permits extremely precise meter-
ing of the fuel, was the result of the legisla-
tion governing exhaust-gas emission limits.
Similar to the carburetor process, with man-
ifold fuel injection the air/fuel mixture is
formed in the intake manifold. 

Even more advantages resulted from the
 development of gasoline direct injection, in
particular with regard to fuel economy and
increases in power output. Direct injection
injects the fuel directly into the engine cylin-
der at exactly the right instant in time. 

1) Named after Nikolaus Otto (1832–1891) who presented
the first gas engine with compression using the 4-stroke
principle at the Paris World Fair in 1878.

Method of operation

The combustion of the air/fuel mixture
causes the piston (Fig. 1, Pos. 8) to perform
a reciprocating movement in the cylinder (9).
The name reciprocating-piston engine, or
better still reciprocating engine, stems from
this principle of functioning. 

The conrod (10) converts the piston’s   
re ciprocating movement into a crankshaft
(11) rotational movement which is main-
tained by a flywheel at the end of the crank-
shaft. Crankshaft speed is also referred to as
engine speed or engine rpm.

Four-stroke principle
Today, the majority of the internal-combus-
tion engines used as vehicle power plants are
of the four-stroke type. The four-stroke prin-
ciple employs gas-exchange valves (5 and 6)
to control the exhaust-and-refill cycle. These
valves open and close the cylinder’s intake
and exhaust passages, and in the process con-
trol the supply of fresh air/fuel mixture and
the forcing out of the burnt exhaust gases.

Method of operation

1st stroke: Induction
Referred to Top Dead Center (TDC), the pis-
ton is moving downwards and increases the
volume of the combustion chamber (7) so
that fresh air (gasoline direct injection) or
fresh air/fuel mixture (manifold injection) 
is drawn into the combustion chamber past
the opened intake valve (5). 

The combustion chamber reaches maxi-

mum volume (Vh+Vc) at Bottom Dead
 Center (BDC).

2nd stroke: Compression
The gas-exchange valves are closed, and the
piston is moving upwards in the cylinder. In
doing so it reduces the combustion-chamber
volume and compresses the air/fuel mixture.
On manifold-injection engines the air/fuel
mixture has already entered the combustion
chamber at the end of the induction stroke.
With a direct-injection engine on the other
hand, depending upon the operating mode,
the fuel is first injected towards the end of the
compression stroke. 

At Top Dead Center (TDC) the combus-

tion-chamber volume is at minimum
 (compression volume Vc).

3rd stroke: Power (or combustion)
Before the piston reaches Top Dead Center
(TDC), the spark plug (2) initiates the com-
bustion of the air/fuel mixture at a given  
ig nition point (ignition angle). This form 
of  ignition is known as externally supplied
 ignition. The piston has already passed its
TDC point before the mixture has combusted
completely. 

The gas-exchange valves remain closed and
the combustion heat increases the pressure in
the cylinder to such an extent that the piston
is forced downward. 

4th stroke: Exhaust
The exhaust valve (6) opens shortly before
Bottom Dead Center (BDC). The hot (ex-
haust) gases are under high pressure and
leave the cylinder through the exhaust valve.
The remaining exhaust gas is forced out by
the upwards-moving piston. 

A new operating cycle starts again with the
induction stroke after every two revolutions
of the crankshaft. 

Valve timing
The gas-exchange valves are opened and
closed by the cams on the intake and exhaust
cam shafts (3 and 1 respectively).  
On engines with only 1 camshaft, a lever
mechanism transfers the cam lift to the  
gas-exchange valves. 

The valve timing defines the opening and
closing times of the gas-exchange valves. Since
it is referred to the crankshaft pos ition, timing
is given in “degrees crankshaft”. Gas flow and
gas-column vibration effects are applied to im-
prove the filling of the combustion chamber
with air/fuel mixture and to remove the ex-
haust gases. This is the reason for the valve
opening and closing times overlapping in a
given crankshaft angular-position range.

The camshaft is driven from the crankshaft
through a toothed belt (or a chain or gear pair).
On 4-stroke engines, a complete working cycle
takes two rotations of the crankshaft. In other
words, the camshaft only turns at half crank-
shaft speed, so that the step-down ratio be-
tween crankshaft and camshaft is 2:1.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Method of operation

Compression
The difference between the maximum piston
displacement Vh and the compression volume
Vc is the compression ratio

ε = (Vh + Vc)/Vc.

The engine’s compression ratio is a vital
 factor in determining 
(cid:2) Torque generation
(cid:2) Power generation
(cid:2) Fuel economy and
(cid:2) Emissions of harmful pollutants

The gasoline-engine’s compression ratio ε
varies according to design configuration and
the selected form of fuel injection (manifold
or direct injection ε = 7...13). Extreme com-
pression ratios of the kind employed in diesel
powerplants (ε = 14...24) are not suitable for
use in gasoline engines. Because the knock re-
sistance of the fuel is limited, the extreme
compression pressures and the high combus-
tion-chamber temperatures resulting from
such compression ratios must be avoided in
order to prevent spontaneous and uncon-
trolled detonation of the air/fuel mixture. The
resulting knock can damage the engine.

Air/fuel ratio
Complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture
relies on a stoichiometric mixture ratio. A

stoichiometric ratio is defined as 14.7 kg of
air for 1 kg of fuel, that is, a 14.7 to 1 mixture
ratio.

The air/fuel ratio λ (lambda) indicates the
extent to which the instantaneous monitored
air/fuel ratio deviates from the theoretical
ideal:

λ = 

induction air mass
theoretical air requirement

The lambda factor for a stoichiometric ratio
is λ 1.0. λ is also referred to as the excess-air
factor.

Richer fuel mixtures result in λ figures of

less than 1. Leaning out the fuel produces
mixtures with excess air: λ then exceeds 1. Be-
yond a certain point the mixture encounters
the lean-burn limit, beyond which ignition is
no longer possible. The excess-air factor has a
decisive effect on the specific fuel consump-
tion (Fig. 3) and untreated pollutant emis-
sions (Fig. 4).

Induction-mixture distribution in the
combustion chamber 
Homogeneous distribution
The induction systems on engines with mani -
fold injection distribute a homogeneous
air/fuel mixture throughout the  combustion
chamber. The entire induction charge has a

specific operating conditions, also rely on ho-
mogeneous mixture distribution.

Stratified-charge concept
A combustible mixture cloud with λ ≈ 1 sur-
rounds the tip of the spark plug at the instant
ignition is triggered. At this point the remain-
der of the combustion chamber contains
 either non-combustible gas with no fuel, 
or an extremely lean air/fuel charge. The cor-
responding strategy, in which the ignitable
mixture cloud is present only in one portion of
the combustion chamber, is the stratified-
charge concept (Fig. 5b). With this concept,
the overall mixture – meaning the average
mixture ratio within the entire combustion
chamber – is extremely lean (up to λ ≈ 10). This
type of lean operation fosters extremely high
levels of fuel economy.

chamber

b

Efficient implementation of the stratified-
charge concept is impossible without direct
fuel injection, as the entire induction strategy
depends on the ability to inject fuel directly
into the combustion chamber just  before ig-
nition.

Ignition and flame propagation
The spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture by
discharging a spark across a gap. The extent
to which ignition will result in reliable flame
propagation and secure combustion depends
in large part on the air/fuel mixture λ, which
should be in a range extending from λ =
0.75...1.3. Suitable flow patterns in the area
immediately adjacent to the spark-plug elec-
trodes can be employed to ignite mixtures as
lean as λ ≤ 1.7. 

The initial ignition event is followed by for-
mation of a flame-front. The flame front’s
propagation rate rises as a function of com-
bustion pressure before dropping off again
toward the end of the combustion process.
The mean flame front propagation rate is 
on the order of 15...25 m/s. 

The flame front’s propagation rate is the
combination of mixture transport and com-
bustion rates, and one of its defining factors is
the air/fuel ratio λ. The combustion rate peaks
at slightly rich mixtures on the order 
of λ = 0.8...0.9. In this range it is possible to ap-
proach the conditions coinciding with an ideal
constant-volume combustion process (refer to
section on “Engine efficiency”). Rapid com-
bustion rates provide highly satisfactory full-
throttle, full-load performance at high engine
speeds. 

Good thermodynamic efficiency is

 produced by the high combustion tempera-
tures achieved with air/fuel mixtures of 
λ = 1.05...1.1. However, high combustion
temperatures and lean mixtures also promote
generation of nitrous oxides (NOX), which
are subject to strict limitations under official
emissions standards.

(Fig. 1, Pos. 14), the throttle valve (13) ensur-
ing that the air quantity is metered. The fuel
is metered through fuel injectors. Further-
more, usually part of the burnt mixture
 (exhaust gas) from the last combustion is
 retained as residual gas (9) in the cylinder or
exhaust gas is returned specifically to increase
the residual-gas content in the cylinder (4).

Components of the cylinder charge
The gas mixture trapped in the combustion
chamber when the intake valve closes is re-
ferred to as the cylinder charge. This is com-
prised of the fresh gas and the residual gas. 

The term “relative air charge rac” has been

introduced in order to have a quantity
which is independent of the engine’s dis-
placement. It describes the air content in 
the cylinder and is defined as the ratio of 
the current air quantity in the cylinder to
the air quantity that would be contained in
the engine displacement under standard
conditions (p0 = 1013 hPa, T0 =273 K). Ac-
cordingly, there is a relative fuel quantity rfq;
this is defined in such a way that identical
values for rac and rfq result in λ = 1, i.e., 
λ = rac/rfq, or with specified λ : rfq = rac/λ.

Fresh gas
The freshly introduced gas mixture in the
cylinder is comprised of the fresh air drawn
in and the fuel entrained with it. In a mani-
fold-injection engine, all the fuel has already
been mixed with the fresh air upstream of
the intake valve. On direct-injection systems,
on the other hand, the fuel is injected di-
rectly into the combustion chamber.

The majority of the fresh air enters the

cylinder with the air-mass flow (Fig. 1, 
Pos. 6, 7) via the throttle valve (13). Addi-
tional fresh gas, comprising fresh air and
fuel vapor, is directed to the cylinder via the
evaporative-emissions control system (3, 2).

For homogeneous operation at λ (cid:4) 1, the
air in the cylinder directed via the throttle
valve after the intake valve (11) has closed 
is the decisive quantity for the work at the
piston during the combustion stroke and
therefore for the engine’s output torque. In
this case, the air charge corresponds to the
torque and the engine load. Here, changing
the throttle-valve angle only indirectly leads
to a change in the air charge. First of all, the
pressure in the intake manifold must rise so
that a greater air mass flows into the cylinder
via the intake valves. Fuel can, on the other
hand, be injected more contemporaneously
with the combustion process and metered
precisely to the individual cylinder. There-
fore the injected fuel quantity is dependent
on the current air quantity, and the gasoline
engine is an air-directed system in “conven-
tional” homogeneous mode at λ (cid:4) 1.

During lean-burn operation (stratified
charge), however, the torque (engine load) –
on account of the excess air – is a direct
product of the injected fuel mass. The air
mass can thus differ for the same torque.
The gasoline engine is therefore fuel-di-
rected during lean-burn operation.

Almost always, measures aimed at increasing
the engine’s maximum torque and maxi-
mum output power necessitate an increase
in the maximum possible fresh-gas charge.
This can be achieved by increasing the en-
gine displacement but also by supercharging
(see section entitled “Supercharging”). 

Residual gas
The residual-gas share of the cylinder charge
comprises that portion of the cylinder charge
which has already taken part in the combus-
tion process. In principle, one differentiates
between internal and external residual gas.
Internal residual gas is the exhaust gas which
remains in the upper clearance volume of the
cylinder after combustion or which, while
the intake and exhaust valves are simultane-
ously open (valve overlap, see section entitled
“Gas exchange”), is drawn from the exhaust
port back into the intake manifold (internal
exhaust-gas recirculation). 

External residual gas is exhaust gas which

is introduced via an exhaust-gas recircula-
tion valve (Fig. 1, Pos. 4, 5) into the intake
manifold (external exhaust-gas recircula-
tion).

The residual gas is made up of inert gas 1)
and – in the event of excess air, i.e., during
lean-burn operation – of unburnt air. The
amount of inert gas in the residual gas is
particularly important. This no longer con-
tains any oxygen and therefore does not par-
ticipate in combustion during the following
power cycle. However, it does delay ignition
and slows down the course of combustion,
which results in slightly lower efficiency but
also in lower peak pressures and tempera-
tures. In this way, a specifically used amount
of residual gas can reduce the emission of
nitrogen oxides (NOX). This then is the
 benefit of inert gas in lean-burn operation
in that the three-way catalytic converter is
unable to reduce the nitrogen oxides in the
event of excess air.

1) Components in the combustion chamber which behave

inertly, that is, do not participate in the combustion process.

In homogeneous engine mode, the fresh-gas
charge displaced by the residual gas (consist-
ing in this case of inert gas only) is compen-
sated by means of a greater opening of the
throttle valve. With a constant fresh-gas
charge, this increases the intake-manifold
pressure, therefore reduces the throttling
losses (see section entitled “Gas exchange”),
and in all results in reduced fuel consump-
tion. 

Gas exchange
The process of replacing the consumed
cylinder charge (exhaust gas, also referred to
in the above as residual gas) with fresh gas is
known as gas exchange or the charge cycle. 
It is controlled by the opening and closing of
the intake and exhaust valves in combina-
tion with the piston stroke. The shape and
position of the camshaft cams determine the
progression of the valve lift and thereby in-
fluence the cylinder charge. 

The opening and closing times of the
valves are called valve timing and the maxi-
mum distance a valve is lifted from its seat is
known as the valve lift or valve stroke. The
characteristic variables are Exhaust Opens
(EO), Exhaust Closes (EC), Intake Opens
(IO), Intake Closes (IC) and the valve lift.
There are engines with fixed and others with
variable timing and valve lifts (see chapter
entitled “Cylinder-charge control systems”).

The amount of residual gas for the following
power cycle can be significantly influenced
by a valve overlap. During the valve overlap,
intake and exhaust valves are simultaneously
open for a certain amount of time, i.e., the
intake valve opens before the exhaust valve
closes. If in the overlap phase the pressure 
in the intake manifold is lower than that 
in the exhaust train, the residual gas flows
back into the intake manifold; because the
residual gas drawn back in this way is drawn
in again after Exhaust Closes, this results in
an increase in the residual-gas content. 

58

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Cylinder charge

In the case of supercharging, the pressure be-
fore the intake valve can also be higher during
the overlap phase; in this event, the residual
gas flows in the direction of the exhaust train
such that it is properly cleared away (“scav-
enging”) and it is also possible for the air to
flow through into the exhaust train. 

When the residual gas is successfully scav-
enged, its volume is then available for an in-
creased fresh-gas charge. The scavenging effect
is therefore used to increase torque in the
lower speed range (up to approx. 2000 rpm),
either in combination with dynamic super-
charging in naturally aspirated engines or
with turbocharging.

Volumetric efficiency and air consumption
The success of the gas-exchange process is
measured in the variables volumetric effi-
ciency, air consumption and retention rate.
The volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the
fresh-gas charge actually remaining in the
cylinder to the theoretically maximum possi-
ble charge. It differs from the relative air
charge in that the volumetric efficiency is
 referred to the external conditions at the time
of measurement and not to standard condi-
tions. 

The air consumption describes the total
air-mass throughput during the gas-exchange
process, likewise referred to the theoretically
maximum possible charge. The air consump-
tion can also include the air mass which is
transferred directly into the exhaust train
during the valve overlap. The retention rate,
the ratio of volumetric efficiency to air con-
sumption, specifies the proportion of the air-
mass throughput which remains in the cylin-
der at the end of the gas-exchange process.
The maximum volumetric efficiency for
naturally aspirated engines is 0.6...0.9. It de-
pends on the combustion-chamber shape, the
opened cross-sections of the gas-exchange
valves, and the valve timing. 

Pumping losses
Work is expended in the form of pumping
losses or gas-exchange losses in order to re-
place the exhaust gas with fresh gas in the
gas-exchange process. These losses use up
part of the mechanical work generated and
therefore reduce the effective efficiency of the
engine. In the intake phase, i.e., during the
downward stroke of the piston, the intake-
manifold pressure in throttled mode 
is less than the ambient pressure and in
 particular the pressure in the piston return
chamber. The piston must work against this
pressure differential (throttling losses). 

A dynamic pressure occurs in the combus-

tion chamber during the upward stroke of 
the piston when the burnt gas is emitted, 
particularly at high engine speeds and loads;
the piston must expend energy in order to
overcome this pressure (push-out losses).

If with gasoline direct injection stratified-
charge operation is used with the throttle
valve fully opened or high exhaust-gas recir-
culation is used in homogeneous operation
(λ (cid:4) 1), this increases the intake-manifold
pressure and reduces the pressure differential
above the piston. In this way, the engine’s
throttling losses can be reduced, which in
turn improves the effective efficiency.

Supercharging
The torque which can be achieved during 
homogenous operation at λ (cid:4) 1 is propor-
tional to the fresh-gas charge. This means that
maximum torque can be increased by com-
pressing the air before it enters the cylinder
(supercharging). This leads to an increase in
volumetric efficiency to values above 1.

Dynamic supercharging
Supercharging can be achieved simply by 
taking advantage of the dynamic effects inside
the intake manifold. The supercharging level
depends on the intake manifold’s design and
on its operating point (for the most part, on
engine speed, but also on cylinder charge).
The possibility of changing the intake-mani-
fold geometry while the engine is running
(variable intake-manifold geometry) means

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Cylinder charge

59

that dynamic supercharging can be applied
across a wide operating range to increase the
maximum cylinder charge.

Mechanical supercharging
The intake-air density can be further in-
creased by compressors which are driven
mechanically from the engine’s crankshaft.
The compressed air is forced through the
 intake manifold and into the engine’s
 cylinders.

Exhaust-gas turbocharging
In contrast mechanical supercharging, the
compressor of the exhaust-gas turbocharger
is driven by an exhaust-gas turbine located
in the exhaust-gas flow, and not by the en-
gine’s crankshaft. This enables recovery of
some of the energy in the exhaust gas. 

Charge recording
In a gasoline engine with homogeneous 
λ = 1 operation, the injected fuel quantity 
is dependent on the air quantity. This is nec-
essary because after a change to the throttle-
valve angle the air charge changes only grad-
ually while the fuel quantity can be varied
from injection to injection.

For this reason, the current available air
charge must be determined for each com-
bustion in the engine-management system
(charge recording). There are essentially
three systems which can be used to record
the charge:
(cid:2) A hot-film air-mass meter (HFM) mea-
sures the air-mass flow into the intake
manifold.

(cid:2) A model is used to calculate the air-mass
flow from the temperature before the
throttle valve, the pressure before and
 after the throttle valve, and the throttle-
valve angle (throttle-valve model, 
α/n system 1)).

(cid:2) A model is used to calculate the charge

drawn in by the cylinder from the engine
speed (n), the pressure (p) in the intake
manifold (i.e., before the intake valve), 
the temperature in the intake passage and
further additional information (e.g., cam -
shaft/valve-lift adjustment, intake-mani-
fold changeover, position of the swirl con-
trol valve) (p/n system). Sophisticated
models may be necessary, depending on
the complexity of the engine, particularly
with regard to the variabilities of the valve
gear.

Because only the mass flow passing into the
intake manifold can be determined with a
hot-film air-mass meter or a throttle-valve
model, both these systems only provide a
cylinder-charge value during stationary en-
gine operation. Stationary means at constant
intake-manifold pressure; because then the
mass flows flowing into the intake manifold
and off into the engine are identical.

In the event of a sudden load change
(change in the throttle-valve angle), the in-
flowing mass flow changes spontaneously,
while the off-flowing mass flow and with 
it the cylinder charge only change if the
 intake-manifold pressure has increased 
or  reduced. The accumulator behavior 
of the intake manifold must therefore 
also be imitated (intake-manifold model).

1) The designation α/n system is historically conditioned
since originally the pressure after the throttle valve was
not taken into account and the mass flow was stored in 
a program map covering throttle-valve angle and engine
speed. This simplified approach is sometimes still used
 today.

Torque and power

Torque and power

Torques at the drivetrain
The power P delivered by a gasoline engine
is defined by the available clutch torque M
and the engine speed n. The clutch torque 
is the torque developed by the combustion
process less friction torque (friction losses in
the engine), pumping losses, and the torque
needed to drive the auxiliary equipment
(Fig. 1). The drive torque is derived from 
the clutch torque plus the losses arising at
the clutch and transmission.

The combustion torque is generated in
the power cycle and is determined in en-
gines with manifold injection by the follow-
ing variables:
(cid:2) The air mass which is available for com-
bustion when the intake valves close
(cid:2) The fuel mass which is available at the

same moment, and

(cid:2) The moment in time when the ignition
spark initiates the combustion of the
air/fuel mixture

Direct-injection gasoline engines function 
at certain operating points with excess air
(lean-burn operation). The cylinder thus
contains air, which has no effect on the gen-
erated torque. Here, it is the fuel mass which
has the most effect.

Generation of torque 
The physical quantity torque M is the pro -
duct of force F times lever arm s :

M = F · s

The connecting rod utilizes the throw of 
the crankshaft to convert the piston’s linear
travel into rotary motion. The force with
which the expanding air/fuel mixture drives
the piston down the cylinder is converted
into torque by the lever arm generated by
the throw.

The lever arm l which is effective for the
torque is the lever component vertical to the
force (Fig. 2). The force and the leverage an-
gle are parallel at Top Dead Center (TDC).

Torque and power

61

Relationship between torque and power
The engine’s power output P climbs along
with increasing torque M and engine
speed n. The following applies:

P = 2 · π · M · n

Engine power increases until it reaches its
peak value at rated speed nrat with rated
power Prat. Owing to the substantial decrease
in torque, power generation drops again at
extremely high engine speeds.

A transmission to vary conversion ratios

is needed to adapt the gasoline engine’s
torque and power curves to meet the
 requirements of vehicle operation.

This results in an effective lever arm of zero.
The ignition angle must be selected in such a
way as to trigger mixture ignition while the
crankshaft is rotating through a phase of in-
creasing lever arm (0...90 °crankshaft). This
enables the engine to generate the maximum
possible torque. The engine’s design (for in-
stance, piston displacement, combustion-
chamber geometry, volumetric efficiency,
charge) determines the maximum possible
torque M that it can generate. 

Essentially, the torque is adapted to the
 requirements of actual driving by adjusting
the quality and quantity of the air/fuel mix-
ture and the ignition angle. Fig. 3 shows the
typical torque and power curves, plotted
against engine speed, for a manifold-injec-
tion gasoline engine. As engine speed in-
creases, full-load torque initially increases to
its maximum Mmax. At higher engine speeds,
torque falls off again as the shorter opening
times of the intake valves limits the cylinder
charge.

Engine designers focus on attempting 
to obtain maximum torque at low engine
speeds of around 2000 rpm. This rpm range
coincides with optimal fuel economy.
 Engines with exhaust-gas turbochargers 
are able to meet these requirements.

Engine efficiency

Engine efficiency

Thermal efficiency
The internal-combustion engine does not con-
vert all the energy which is chemically available
in the fuel into mechanical work, and some of
the added energy is lost. This means that an en-
gine’s efficiency is less than 100% (Fig. 1).
Thermal efficiency is one of the important links
in the engine’s efficiency chain. 

Pressure-volume diagram (p-V diagram)
The p-V diagram is used to display the
 pressure and volume conditions during 
a complete working cycle of the 4-stroke
IC engine.

The ideal cycle
Figure 2 (curve A) shows the compression
and power strokes of an ideal process as
 defined by the laws of Boyle/Mariotte and
Gay- Lussac. The piston travels from BDC 
to TDC (point 1 to point 2), and the air/fuel
mixture is compressed without the addition
of heat (Boyle/Mariotte). Subsequently, 
the mixture burns accompanied by a pressure
rise (point 2 to point 3) while volume re-
mains constant (Gay-Lussac). 

From TDC (point 3), the piston travels to-

wards BDC (point 4), and the combustion-
chamber volume increases. The pressure of
the burnt gases drops whereby no heat is 
released (Boyle/Mariotte). Finally, the burnt
mixture cools off again with the  volume 
remaining constant (Gay-Lussac)  until the
initial status (point 1) is reached again. 

The area inside the points 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 shows
the work gained during a complete working
cycle. The exhaust valve opens at point 4 and
the gas, which is still under pressure, escapes
from the cylinder. If it were possible for the
gas to expand completely  by the time point 5
is reached, the area described by 1 – 4 – 5
would represent usable energy. On an ex-
haust-gas-turbocharged  engine, the part
above the atmospheric line (1 bar) can
to some extent be utilized (1 – 4 – 5(cid:2)).

Real p-V diagram
Since it is impossible during normal engine
operation to maintain the basic conditions
for the ideal cycle, the actual p-V diagram
(Fig. 2, curve B) differs from the ideal 
p-V diagram.

Measures for increasing thermal efficiency
The thermal efficiency rises along with
 increasing air/fuel-mixture compression. 
The higher the compression, the higher the
pressure in the cylinder at the end of the
compression phase, and the larger is the en-
closed area in the p-V diagram. This area is 
an indication of the energy generated during
the combustion process. When selecting 
the compression ratio, the fuel’s antiknock
 qualities must be taken into account. 

Manifold-injection engines inject the fuel
into the intake manifold onto the closed in-
take valve, where it is stored until drawn 
into the cylinder. During the formation of 
the air/fuel mixture, the fine fuel droplets 
vaporize. The energy needed for this process 
is in the form of heat and is taken from the
air and the intake-manifold walls. On direct-
injection engines the fuel is injected into 
the combustion chamber, and the energy
needed for fuel-droplet vaporization is taken
from the air trapped in the cylinder which
cools off as a result. This means that the 
compressed air/fuel mixture is at a lower tem-
perature than is the case with a manifold-in-
jection engine, so that a higher  compression
ratio can be chosen. 

Thermal losses
The heat generated during combustion heats
up the cylinder walls. Part of this thermal 
energy is radiated and lost. In the case of
gasoline direct injection, the stratified-charge
air/fuel mixture cloud is surrounded by a
jacket of gases which do not participate in the
combustion process. This gas jacket hinders
the transfer of heat to the cylinder walls and
therefore reduces the thermal losses. 

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Engine efficiency

63

Further losses stem from the incomplete
combustion of the fuel which has condensed
onto the cylinder walls. Thanks to the 
insulating effects of the gas jacket, these losses
are reduced in stratified-charge operation.
Further thermal losses result from the resid-
ual heat of the exhaust gases. 

Frictional losses
The frictional losses are the total of all the
friction between moving parts in the engine
itself and in its auxiliary equipment. For in-
stance, due to the piston-ring friction at the
cylinder walls, the bearing friction, and the
friction of the alternator drive.

Losses at λ = 1
The efficiency of the constant-volume cycle
climbs along with increasing excess-air factor
(λ). Due to the reduced flame-propagation
velocity common to lean air/fuel mixtures, at
λ > 1.1 combustion is increasingly sluggish, a
fact which has a negative effect upon the SI
engine’s efficiency curve. In the final analysis,
efficiency is the highest in the range λ =
1.1...1.3. Efficiency is therefore less for a ho-
mogeneous air/fuel-mixture formation with λ
= 1 than it is for an air/fuel mixture featuring
excess air. When a 3-way catalytic converter is
used for emissions control, an air/fuel mix-
ture with λ = 1 is ab -
solutely imperative for efficient operation.

Pumping losses
During the exhaust and refill cycle, the engine
draws in fresh gas during the 1st (induction)
stroke. The desired quantity of gas is con-
trolled by the throttle-valve opening. 
A vacuum is generated in the intake manifold
which opposes engine operation 
(throttling losses). Since with a gasoline 
direct-injection engine the throttle valve is
wide open at idle and part load, and the
torque is determined by the injected fuel
mass, the pumping losses (throttling losses)
are lower.

In the 4th stroke, work is also involved in
forcing the remaining exhaust gases out of
the cylinder.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Specific fuel consumption

Specific fuel consumption

Specific fuel consumption be is defined as the
mass of the fuel (in grams) that the internal-
combustion engine requires to perform a
specified amount of work (kW · h, kilowatt
hours). This parameter thus provides a more
accurate measure of the energy extracted
from each unit of fuel than the terms liters
per hour, litres per 100 kilo meters or miles
per gallon.

Effects of excess-air factor
Homogeneous mixture distribution
When engines operate on homogeneous in-
duction mixtures, specific fuel consumption
initially responds to increases in excess-air
factor λ by falling (Fig. 1). The progressive 
reductions in the range extending to 
λ = 1.0 are explained by the incomplete 
combustion that results when a rich air/
fuel mixture burns with inadequate air. 

The throttle plate must be opened to wider
apertures to obtain a given torque during op-
eration in the lean range (λ > 1). The resulting
reduction in throttling losses combines 
with enhanced thermodynamic efficiency 
to furnish lower rates of specific fuel con-
sumption.

Excess-air factor λ

As the excess-air factor is increased, the flame
front’s propagation rate falls in the  resulting,
progressively leaner mixtures. 
The ignition timing must be further ad-
vanced to compensate for the resulting lag 
in ignition of the combustion mixture. 

As the excess-air factor continues to rise,
the engine approaches the lean-burn limit,
where incomplete combustion takes place
(combustion miss). This results in a radical
increase in fuel consumption. The excess-air
factor that coincides with the lean-burn limit
varies according to engine design.

Stratified-charge concept
Engines featuring direct gasoline injection
can operate with high excess-air factors in
their stratified-charge mode. The only fuel 
in the combustion chamber is found in the
stratification layer immediately adjacent to
the tip of the spark plug. The excess-air  
factor within this layer is approximately 
λ = 1. 

The remainder of the combustion chamber

is filled with air and inert gases (exhaust-
gas recirculation). The large throttle-plate
apertures available in this mode lead to a 
reduction in pumping losses. This combines
with the thermodynamic benefits to provide 
a substantial reduction in specific fuel con-
sumption.

Effects of ignition timing
Homogeneous mixture distribution
Each point in the cycle corresponds to an 
optimal phase in the combustion process
with its own defined ignition timing (Fig. 1).
Any deviation from this ignition timing 
will have negative effects on specific fuel 
consumption. 

Stratified-charge concept
The range of possibilities for varying the igni-
tion angle is limited on direct-injection gaso-
line engines operating in the stratified-charge
mode. Because the ignition spark must be 
triggered as soon as the mixture cloud reaches
the spark plug, the ideal ignition point is largely
determined by injection timing.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Specific fuel consumption

65

Achieving ideal fuel consumption
During operation on homogeneous induc-
tion mixtures, gasoline engines must operate
on a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of λ = 1 to
create an optimal operating environment for
the 3-way catalytic converter. Under these
conditions using the excess-air factor to ma-
nipulate specific fuel consumption is not an
option. Instead, the only available recourse 
is to vary the ignition timing. Defining igni-
tion timing always equates with finding the
best compromise between maximum fuel
economy and minimal levels of raw exhaust
emissions. Because the catalytic converter’s
treatment of toxic emissions is very effective
once it is hot, the aspects related to fuel
economy are the primary considerations
once the engine has warmed to normal
 operating temperature.

Fuel-consumption map
Testing on an engine dynamometer can be
used to determine specific fuel consumption
in its relation to brake mean effective pres-
sure and to engine speed. The monitored
data are then entered in the fuel consump-
tion map (Fig. 2). The points representing
levels of specific fuel consumption are

joined to form curves. Because the resulting
graphic portrayal resembles a sea shell, the
lines are also known as shell or conchoid
curves.

As the diagram indicates, the point of
minimum specific fuel consumption co -
incides with a high level of brake mean
 effective pressure pme at an engine speed 
of roughly 2600 rpm.

Because the brake mean effective pressure
also serves as an index of torque generation
M, curves representing power output P can
also be entered in the chart. Each curve as-
sumes the form of a hyperbola. Although
the chart indicates identical power at differ-
ent engine speeds and torques (operating
points A and B), the specific fuel consump-
tion rates at these operating points are not
the same. At Point B the engine speed is
lower and the torque is higher than at 
Point A. Engine operation can be shifted
 toward Point A by using the transmission 
to select a gear with a higher conversion
 ratio.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Combustion knock

Combustion knock

Among the factors imposing limits on the lati -
tude for enhancing an engine’s thermodynamic
efficiency and increasing power-plant perfor-
mance are spontaneous pre-ignition and detona-
tion. This highly undesirable phenomenon 
is frequently accompanied by an audible “ping-
ing” noise, which is why the generally applicable
term for this condition is “knock”. Knock occurs
when portions of the mixture ignite sponta-
neously before being reached by the flame front.
The intense heat and immense pressure peaks
produced by combustion knock subject pistons,
bearings, cylinder head and head gasket to 
enormous mechanical and thermal loads. Ex-
tended periods of knock can produce blown
head gaskets, holed piston crowns and engine
seizure, and leads to destruction of the engine.

The sources of combustion knock
The spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture to-
ward the end of the compression stroke, just
before the piston reaches Top Dead Centre
(TDC). Because several milliseconds can
elapse until the entire air/fuel mixture can ig-
nite (the precise ignition lag varies  according
to engine speed), the actual combustion peak
occurs after TDC. 

The flame front extends outward from the

spark plug. After being compressed during
the compression stroke, the induction mix-
ture is heated and pressurized as it burns
within the combustion chamber. This further
compresses any unburned air/fuel mixture
within the chamber. As a result, some por-
tions of the compressed air/fuel mixture can
attain temperatures high enough to induce
spontaneous auto-ignition (Fig. 1). Sudden
detonation and uncontrolled combustion are
the results. 

When this type of detonation occurs it pro-
duces a flame front with a propagation rate 10
to 100 times that associated with the normal
combustion triggered by the spark plug (ap-
proximately 20 m/s). This uncontrolled com-
bustion generates pressure pulses which spread
out in circular patterns from the core of the
process. It is when these pulsations impact
against the walls of the cylinder that they 

generate the metallic pinging sound typically 
associated with combustion knock.

Other flame fronts can be initiated at hot
spots within the combustion chamber. Among
the potential sources of this hot-spot ignition
are spark plugs which during operation heat up
excessively due to their heat range being too
low. This type of pre-ignition produces engine
knock by initiating combustion before the 
ignition spark is triggered.

Engine knock can occur throughout the
engine’s speed range. However, it is not possi-
ble to hear it at extremely high rpm, when its
sound is obscured by the noise from general
engine operation.

Factors affecting tendency to knock
Substantial ignition advance: Advancing the
timing to ignite the mixture earlier produces
progressively higher combustion-chamber
temperatures and correspondingly extreme
pressure rises.
High cylinder-charge density: The charge den-
sity must increase as torque demand rises
(engine load factor). This leads to high tem-
peratures during compression.
Fuel grade: Because fuels with low octane 
ratings furnish only limited resistance to
knock, compliance with manufacturer’s 
specifications for fuel grade(s) is vital.
Excessively high compression ratio: One poten-
tial source of excessively high compression
would be a cylinder head gasket of less than
the specified thickness. This leads to higher
pressures and temperatures in the air/fuel
mixture during compression. Deposits and
residue in the combustion chamber (from 
ageing, etc.) can also produce a slight increase
in the effective compression ratio.
Cooling: Ineffective heat dissipation within
the engine can lead to high mixture tempera-
tures within the combustion chamber.
Geometry: The engine’s knock tendency can
be aggravated by unfavorable combustion-
chamber geometry. Poor turbulence and 
swirl characteristics caused by  unsatisfactory
intake-manifold tract configurations are yet
another potential problem source.

Basics of the gasoline (SI) engine

Combustion knock

67

Engine knock with direct 
gasoline  injection
With regard to engine knock, when operating
with homogeneous air/fuel mixtures direct-in-
jection gasoline engines behave the same as
manifold-injected power plants. One major
difference is the cooling effect exerted by the
evaporating fuel during direct injection, which
reduces the temperature of the air within the
cylinder to levels lower than those encountered
with manifold injection.

During operation in the stratified-charge
mode it is only in the area immediately adja-
cent to the spark plug tip that an ignitable
mixture is present. When the remainder of the
combustion chamber is filled with air or inert
gases, there is no danger of spontaneous igni-
tion and engine knock. Nor is there any danger
of detonation when an extremely lean air/fuel
mixture is present within these outlying sec-
tions of the combustion chamber. The ignition
energy required to generate a flame in this
kind of lean mixture would be substantially
higher than that needed to spark a stoichio-
metric combustion mixture. This is why strati-
fied-charge operation effectively banishes the
danger of engine knock.

1

The sources of combustion knock

Avoiding consistent engine knock
To effectively avoid pre-ignition and detona-
tion, ignition systems not equipped with
knock detection rely on ignition timing with
a safety margin of 5...8 degrees (crankshaft)
relative to the knock limit.

Ignition systems featuring knock detection
employ one or several knock sensors to moni-
tor acoustic waves in the engine. The engine-
management ECU detects knock in individual
combustion cycles by analysing the electrical
signals relayed by these sensors. The ECU then
responds by retarding the ignition timing for
the affected cylinder to prevent continuous
knock. The system then gradually advances the
ignition timing back toward its original posi-
tion. This progressive advance process contin-
ues until the ignition timing is either back at
the initial reference point programmed into
the engine’s software map, or until the system
starts to detect knock again. The engine man-
agement regulates the timing advance for each
cylinder individually.

The limited number of combustion events

with mild knock of the kind that also occur
with knock control are not injurious to the
health of the engine. On the contrary: They
help dissolve deposits formed by oil and fuel
additives within the combustion chamber (on
intake and exhaust valves, etc.), allowing
them to be combusted and/or discharged
with the exhaust gases.

Advantages of knock control
Thanks to reliable knock recognition,  
engines with knock control can use higher
compression ratios. Co-ordinated control of
the ignition’s timing advance also makes it 
possible to do without the safety margin
 between the timing point and the knock
threshold; the ignition timing can be selected
for the “best case” instead of the “worst case”
scenario. This provides benefits in terms of
thermodynamic efficiency. Knock control 
(cid:2) reduces fuel consumption, 
(cid:2) enhances torque and power, and 
(cid:2) allows engine operation on different fuels
within an extended range of octane ratings
(both premium and regular unleaded, etc.).

Inductive ignition system

Design

Inductive ignition system

Ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the gaso-
line engine is electric; it is produced by gen-
erating a flashover between the electrodes
on a spark plug. The ignition-coil energy
converted in the spark ignites the com-
pressed mixture immediately adjacent to
the spark plug, creating a flame front which
then spreads to ignite the mixture in the
 entire combustion chamber. The inductive
ignition system generates in each power
stroke the high voltage required for flash -
over and the spark duration required for
 ignition. The electrical energy drawn from
the vehicle electrical system battery is tem-
porarily stored in the ignition coil for this
purpose. 

The most significant application for the in-
ductive ignition system is in passenger cars
with gasoline engines. The most commonly
used are four-stroke engines with four cylin-
ders. 

Design of the ignition circuit of an inductive ignition system

Design

Figure 1 shows the basic design of the igni-
tion circuit of an inductive ignition system
using the example of a system with distribu-
torless (stationary) voltage distribution – 
as is used in all current applications – and
single-spark ignition coils. The ignition cir-
cuit comprises the following components: 
(cid:2) Ignition driver stage (5), which is inte-
grated in the Motronic ECU or in the
 ignition coil

(cid:2) Ignition coils (3), designed as pencil coils
or as a compact coil to generate one spark
(as illustrated) or two sparks

(cid:2) Spark plugs (4), and 
(cid:2) Connecting devices and interference sup-

pressors 

Older ignition systems with rotating high-
voltage distribution require an additional
high-voltage distributor. This ensures that
the ignition energy generated in the ignition
coil is directed to the correct spark plug.

Function and method of operation

69

Function and method 
of operation

It is the function of the ignition to ignite the
compressed air/fuel mixture and thus initi-
ate its combustion. Safe combustion of the
mixture must be guaranteed in the process.
To this end, sufficient energy must be stored
in the ignition coil prior to the moment of
ignition and the ignition spark must be gen-
erated at the correct moment of ignition.

All the components of the ignition system

are adapted in terms of their designs and
performance data to the demands of the
overall system.

Generating the ignition spark
A magnetic field is built up in the ignition
coil when a current flows in the primary
 circuit. The ignition energy required for
 ignition is stored in this magnetic field.

Interrupting the coil current at the mo-
ment of ignition causes the magnetic field to
collapse. This rapid magnetic-field change
induces a high voltage (Fig. 2) on the sec-
ondary side of the ignition coil as a result 
of the large number of turns (turns ratio
 approx. 1:100). When the ignition voltage 
is reached, flashover occurs at the spark 
plug and the compressed air/fuel mixture 
is ignited.

The current in the primary winding only
gradually attains its setpoint value because
of the induced countervoltage. Because the
energy stored in the ignition coil is depen-
dent on the current (E = 1/2LI2), a certain
amount of time (dwell period time) is re-
quired in order to store the energy necessary
for ignition. This dwell period is dependent
on, among others, the vehicle system volt-
age. The ECU program calculates from the
dwell period and the moment of ignition the
cut-in point, and cuts the ignition coil in via
the ignition driver stage and out again at the
moment of ignition.

Flame-front propagation
After the flashover, the voltage at the spark
plug drops to the spark voltage (Fig. 2). The
spark voltage is dependent on the length of
the spark plasma (electrode gap and deflec-
tion due to flow) and ranges between a few
hundred volts and well over 1 kV. The igni-
tion-coil energy is converted in the ignition
spark during the ignition-spark period; this
spark duration lasts between 100 μs to over
2 ms. Following the breakaway of the spark,
the attenuated voltage decays.

The electrical spark between the spark-
plug electrodes generates a high-tempera-
ture plasma. When the mixture at the spark
plug is ignitable and sufficient energy is sup-
plied by the ignition system, the flame core
that is created develops into an automati-
cally propagating flame front.

Moment of ignition
The instant at which the spark ignites the
air/fuel mixture within the combustion
chamber must be selected with extreme
 precision. It is usually specified as an igni-
tion angle in °cks (crankshaft) referred to
Top Dead Center (TDC). This variable has 
a  crucial influence on engine operation and
determines

 increase. The pressure wave which is gener-
ated propagates, strikes the cylinder walls,
and can be heard as combustion knock. 

If knock continues over a longer period 

of time, the engine can incur mechanical
damage caused by the pressure waves and
the excessive thermal loading. To prevent
knock on today’s high-compression engines,
no matter whether of the manifold-injection
or direct-injection type, knock control is
now a standard feature of the engine-man-
agement system. With knock control, knock
sensors (structure-borne-noise sensors)
 detect the start of knock and the ignition
timing is  retarded at the cylinder concerned
(Fig. 4). The pressure increase after the mix-
ture has ignited therefore occurs later, which
reduces the tendency to knock. When the
knocking stops, the ignition-timing adjust-
ment is reversed in stages. To obtain the
best-possible engine efficiency, therefore, 
the basic adaptation of the ignition angle
(ignition map) can be located directly at 
the knock limit.

(cid:2) The delivered torque
(cid:2) The exhaust-gas emissions, and 
(cid:2) The fuel consumption

The moment of ignition is specified in such
a way that all requirements are met as effec-
tively as possible. However, continuous en-
gine knocking must not develop during
 operation.

The influencing variables that determine

the moment of ignition are engines speed
and engine load, or torque. Additional vari-
ables, such as, for example, engine tempera-
ture, are also used to determine the optimal
moment of ignition. These variables are
recorded by sensors and then relayed to the
engine ECU (Motronic). The moment of ig-
nition is calculated from program maps and
characteristic curves, and the actuation sig-
nal for the ignition driver stage is generated.

Knock control
Knock is a phenomenon which occurs 
when ignition takes place too early (Fig. 3).
Here, once regular combustion has started,
the rapid pressure increase in the combus-
tion chamber leads to auto-ignition of the
unburnt residual mixture which has not
been reached by the flame front. The result-
ing abrupt combustion of the residual mix-
ture leads to a considerable local pressure

Ignition parameters

Moment of ignition
Engine-speed and load dependence
Once ignition has been initiated by the
 ignition spark, it takes a few milliseconds 
for the air/fuel mixture to burn completely.
This  period of time remains roughly con-
stant as long as the mixture composition re-
mains unchanged. The moment of ignition
point must be selected so that main com-
bustion, and the accompanying pressure
peak in the cylinder, takes place shortly after
TDC. As engine speed increases, the ignition
angle must therefore be advanced.

The cylinder charge also has an effect 
on the combustion curve. The flame front
propagates at a slower rate when the cylin-
der charge is low. For this reason, with a low
cylinder charge, the ignition angle must also
be advanced.

In the case of gasoline direct injection, the
range for variation of the moment of igni-
tion in stratified-charge mode is limited by
the end of injection and the time needed for
mixture preparation during the compression
stroke.

Basic adaptation of ignition angle
In electronically controlled ignition systems,
the ignition map (Fig. 5) takes into account
the influence of engine speed and cylinder
charge on the ignition angle. This map is
stored in the engine-management system’s
data memory, and forms the basic adapta-
tion of the ignition angle.

The map’s x and y axes represent the en-
gine speed and the relative air charge. A spe-
cific number of values, typically 16, forms
the data points of the map. One ignition an-
gle is stored for each pair of values. The map
therefore contains 256 adjustable ignition-
angle values. By applying linear interpola-
tion between two data points, the number 
of ignition-angle values is increased to 4096.
Using the ignition-map principle for elec-

tronic control of the ignition angle means
that, for every engine operating point, it is
possible to select the best-possible ignition
angle. These maps are ascertained on the en-
gine test stand, or dynamic power analyzer,
where demands pertaining to, for example,
noise, comfort and component protection
are also taken into account.

Additive ignition-angle corrections
Different impacting factors on the moment
of ignition are taken into account through
additive corrections of the basic ignition
 angle, such as, for instance, knock control 
or warming-up after the starting phase. 
The engine temperature has a further influ-
ence on the selection of the ignition angle
(e.g., shifting of the knock limit when the
engine is hot).

Temperature-dependent ignition-angle

corrections are therefore also necessary.
Such corrections are stored in the data
memory in the form of fixed values or
 characteristic curves (e.g., temperature-
 dependent correction). They shift the basic
ignition angle by the specified amount. 
The ignition-angle correction can be 
either an advance or a retardation.

72

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

Ignition angles for specific operating
 conditions
Specific operating states, e.g., starting or
stratified-charge mode with gasoline direct
injection, require ignition angles that deviate
from the ignition map. In such cases, access
is obtained to special ignition angles stored
in the data memory.

Dwell period
The energy stored in the ignition coil is de-
pendent on the level of the primary current
at the moment of ignition (cut-out current)
and the inductance of the primary winding.
The level of the cut-out current is essentially
dependent on the cut-in period (dwell pe-
riod) and the vehicle system voltage. The
dwell periods for obtaining the desired cut-
out current are stored in voltage-dependent
curves or program maps. Changing the
dwell period by way of the temperature 
can also be compensated for.

In order not to thermally overload the
 ignition coil, it is essential to adhere rigidly
to the time required to generate the required
ignition energy in the coil. 

Ignition voltage
The ignition voltage at the point where
flashover between the spark-plug electrodes
occurs is the ignition-voltage demand. 
It is dependent, among other things, on 
(cid:2) The density of the air/fuel mixture in the
combustion chamber, and thus on the
moment of ignition 

(cid:2) The composition of the air/fuel mixture

(excess-air factor, lambda value)
(cid:2) The flow velocity and turbulence 
(cid:2) The electrode geometry
(cid:2) The electrode material, and
(cid:2) The electrode gap

It is vital that the ignition voltage supplied
by the ignition system always exceed the
 ignition-voltage demand under all condi-
tions.

Ignition energy
The cut-out current and the ignition-coil
parameters determine the amount of energy
that the coil stores for application as ignition
energy in the spark. The level of ignition en-
ergy has a decisive influence on flame-front
propagation. Good flame-front propagation
is essential to delivering high-performance
engine operation coupled with low levels 
of toxic emissions. This places considerable
demands on the ignition system.

Energy balance of an ignition
The energy stored in the ignition coil is
 released as soon as the ignition spark is
 initiated. This energy is divided into two
separate components.

Spark head
In order that an ignition spark can be gener-
ated at the spark plug, first the secondary-
side capacitance C of the ignition circuit
must be charged, and this is released again
on flashover. The energy required for this
 increases quadratically with the ignition
voltage U (E = 1/2 CU2). Figure 6 shows the
component of this energy contained in the
spark head.

Spark tail
The energy still remaining in the ignition
coil after flashover (inductive component) 
is then released in the course of the spark
duration. This energy represents the differ-
ence between the total energy stored in the
ignition coil and the energy released during
capacitive discharge. In other words: The
higher the ignition-voltage demand, the
greater the component of total energy con-
tained in the spark head, and the less energy
is converted in the spark duration, i.e., the
shorter the spark duration. When the igni-
tion-voltage demand is high, due for in-
stance to badly worn spark plugs, the energy
stored in the spark tail may no longer be
enough to completely burn an already ig-
nited mixture or to re-ignite a spark that 
has broken away.

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

73

Further increases in the ignition-voltage de-
mand lead to the ignition-miss limit being
reached. Here, the available energy is no
longer enough to generate a flashover, and
instead it decays in a damped oscillation
 (ignition miss).

Energy losses
Figure 6 shows a simplified representation 
of the existing conditions. Ohmic resistance
in the ignition coil and the ignition cables
combined with the suppression resistors
cause losses, which are then unavailable 
as ignition energy.

Additional losses are produced by shunt
resistors. While these losses can result from
contamination on the high-voltage connec-
tions, the primary cause is soot and deposits
on the spark plugs within the combustion
chamber.

The level of shunt losses is also dependent
on the ignition-voltage demand. The higher
the voltage applied at the spark plug, the
greater the currents discharging through 
the shunt resistors.

Mixture ignition
Under ideal (e.g., laboratory) conditions, the
energy required to ignite an air/fuel mixture
with an electrical spark for each individual
injection is approximately 0.2 mJ, provided
the mixture in question is static, homoge-
neous and stoichiometric. Under such con-
ditions, rich and lean mixtures require in
 excess of 3 mJ. 

The energy that is actually required to ig-
nite the mixture is only a fraction of the to-
tal energy in the ignition spark, the ignition
energy. With conventional ignition systems,
energy levels in excess of 15 mJ are needed 
to generate a high-voltage flashover at the
moment of ignition at high breakdown volt-
ages. This additional energy is required to
charge the capacitance on the secondary
side. Further energy is required to maintain
a specific spark duration and to compensate
for losses, due for instance to contamination
shunts at the spark plugs. These require-
ments amount to ignition energies of at least
30...50 mJ, a figure which corresponds to 
an energy level of 60...120 mJ stored in the
ignition coil.

Inductive ignition system

Ignition parameters

Turbulence within the mixture of the kind
encountered when engines with gasoline
 direct injection are operated in stratified-
charge mode can deflect the ignition spark
to such an extent that it breaks away (Fig. 7).
A number of follow-up sparks is then
needed to ignite the mixture, and this energy
must also be provided by the ignition coil.
The ignition tendency decreases in the
case of lean mixtures. A particularly high
level of energy is therefore required to be
able to cover the increased ignition-voltage
demand and at the same time to ensure an
effectively long spark duration.

If inadequate ignition energy is available,
the mixture will fail to ignite. No flame front
is established, and combustion miss occurs.
This is why the system must furnish ade-
quate reserves of ignition energy: To ensure
reliable detonation of the air/fuel mixture,
even under unfavorable external conditions.
It may be enough to ignite just a small por-
tion of the mixture directly with the spark
plug. The mixture igniting at the spark plug
then ignites the remaining mixture in the
cylinder and thereby initiates the combus-
tion process.

Factors affecting ignition performance
Efficient preparation of the mixture with
unobstructed access to the spark plug im-
proves ignition performance, as do extended
spark durations and large spark lengths or
large electrode gaps. Mixture turbulence 
can also be an advantage, provided enough
energy is available for follow-up ignition
sparks should these be needed. Turbulence
supports rapid flame-front distribution in
the combustion chamber, and with it the
complete combustion of the mixture in 
the entire combustion chamber.

Spark-plug contamination is also a signif-
icant factor. If the spark plugs are very dirty,
energy is discharged from the ignition coil
through the spark-plug shunt (deposits)
during the period in which the high voltage
is being built up. This reduces the high volt-
age whilst simultaneously shortening spark
duration. This affects exhaust emissions, 
and can even lead to ignition misses under
extreme conditions, as when the spark plugs
are severely contaminated or wet. 

Ignition misses lead to combustion mis -
ses, which increase both fuel consumption
and pollutant emissions, and can also dam-
age the catalytic converter.

All electrical ignition systems are high-voltage
systems. To avoid potential dangers, always
switch off the ignition or disconnect the power
source before working on any ignition system.
These precautions apply to, e.g.,
(cid:2) Replacing components, such as ignition coils,

spark plugs, ignition cables, etc.

(cid:2) Connecting engine testers, such as timing
stroboscope, dwell-angle/speed tester,
 ignition oscilloscope, etc.

When checking the ignition system, remember
that dangerously high levels of voltage are pre-
sent within the system whenever the ignition is
on. All tests and inspections should therefore
only be carried out by qualified professional
 personnel.

have to be synchronized by means of a
camshaft sensor with the camshaft. 

System with dual-spark ignition coils
One ignition driver stage and one ignition
coil are allocated to every two cylinders. 
The ends of the secondary winding are each
connected to a spark plug in different cylin-
ders. The cylinders have been chosen so that
when one cylinder is in the compression
stroke, the other is in the exhaust stroke (ap-
plies only to engines with an even number
of cylinders). Flashover occurs at both spark
plugs at the moment of ignition. Because it
is important to prevent residual exhaust gas
or fresh induction gas from being ignited 
by the spark during the exhaust stroke addi-
tional spark, the latitude for varying ignition
timing is limited with this system. However,
it does not need to be synchronized with 
the camshaft. Because of these limitations,
dual-spark ignition coils cannot be recom-
mended.

Voltage-distribution concept

Voltage distribution

Rotating high-voltage distribution
The high voltage generated in the ignition
coil (Fig. 8a, Pos. 2) must be applied at the
correct spark plug at the moment of igni-
tion. In the case of rotating high-voltage
 distribution, the high voltage generated by
this single ignition coil is mechanically dis-
tributed to the individual spark plugs (5) 
by an ignition distributor (3). The rotation
speed and the position of the distributor
 rotor, which establishes the electrical con-
nection between the ignition coil and the
spark plug, are coupled to the camshaft.

This form of distribution is no longer of any
significance to new, modern-day engine-
management systems.

Distributorless (stationary) voltage 
distribution
The mechanical components have been
 dispensed with in the distributorless, or
 stationary, voltage-distribution system 
(Fig. 8b). Voltage is distributed on the
 primary side of the ignition coils, which 
are connected directly to the spark plugs.
This permits wear-free and loss-free voltage
distribution. There are two versions of this
type of voltage distribution.

System with single-spark ignition coils
Each cylinder is allocated an ignition driver
stage and an ignition coil. The engine ECU
actuates the ignition driver stages in speci-
fied firing order. 

Since there are no distributor losses, these

ignition coils can be very small in design.
They are preferably mounted directly over
the spark plug. 

Distributorless voltage distribution with
single-spark ignition coils can be used with
any number of cylinders. There are no limi-
tations on the ignition-timing adjustment
range. In this case, the spark plug of the
cylinder which is at firing TDC is the one
that fires. However, the system does also

Inductive ignition system

Ignition driver stage

Ignition driver stage

Function and method of operation 
The function of the ignition driver stage is 
to control the flow of primary current in the
ignition coil. It is usually designed as a three-
stage power transistor with BIP technology
(Bosch Integrated Power, bipolar technol-
ogy). The functions of primary- voltage limi-
tation and primary-current  limitation are
 integrated as monolithic  components on the
ignition driver stage, and protect the ignition
components against overload. 

During operation, the ignition driver
stage and the ignition coil both heat up. 
In order not to exceed the permissible oper-
ating temperatures, it is necessary that ap-
propriate measures be taken to ensure that
the heat losses are reliably dissipated to the
surroundings even when outside tempera-
tures are high. In order to avoid high power
loss in the ignition driver stage, the function
of primary-current limitation is only to
limit the current in the event of a fault 
(e.g., short circuit).

In the future, the three-stage circuit-breakers
will be superseded by the new IGBTs (Insu-
lated Gate Bipolar Transistors, hybrid form
on field-effect and bipolar transistors), also
for ignition applications. The IGBT has
some advantages over BIP:
(cid:2) Virtually power-free actuation (voltage

 instead of current)
(cid:2) Low saturation voltage
(cid:2) Higher load current
(cid:2) Lower switching times
(cid:2) Higher clamp voltage
(cid:2) Higher holding temperature
(cid:2) Protected against polarity reversal in the

12 V vehicle electrical system

Design variations 
Ignition driver stages are categorized into
internal and external driver stages. The for-
mer are integrated on the engine ECU’s
printed-circuit board, and the latter are
 located in their own housing outside the
 engine ECU. Due to the costs involved,
 external driver stages are no longer used 
on new developments. 

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly
common for driver stages to be incorporated
in the ignition coil. This solution avoids ca-
bles in the wiring harness which carry high
currents and are subjected to high voltages.
In addition, the power loss incurred in the
Motronic ECU is accordingly lower. Stricter
demands with regard to actuation, diagnos-
tic capability and temperature load are made
of the driver stages integrated in the ignition
coil. These demands are derived from the
 installation circumstances directly on the
engine with higher ambient temperatures,
ground offsets between ECU and ignition
coil, and the additional expenditure involved
in transmitting diagnostic information from
the ignition coil to the ECU either via an
 additional cable or through the intelligent
use of the control line to include the return
transmission of diagnostic information.

Connecting devices and interference suppressors

77

Normally, the suppression resistors are inte-
grated in the spark-plug connectors and ca-
ble connectors. Spark plugs are also available
which feature an integral suppression resis-
tor. However, increasing resistance on the
secondary side leads to additional energy
losses in the ignition circuit, with lower igni-
tion energy at the spark plug as the ultimate
result. 

Interference radiation can be even further
reduced by partially or completely screening
the ignition system. This screening includes
the ignition cables. This effort is justified
only in special cases (official government
and military vehicles, radio equipment 
with high transmitting power).

Connecting devices and
 interference suppressors

Ignition cables
The high voltage generated in the ignition
coil must be delivered to the spark plug. 
For this purpose, plastic-insulated, high-
voltage-proof cables with special connectors
at their ends for contacting the high-voltage
components are used with ignition coils
which are not mounted directly on the 
spark plug (e.g., dual-spark ignition coils). 
Since, for the ignition system, each high-

voltage cable represents a capacitive load
which reduces the available secondary
 voltage, the ignition cables must be kept 
as short as possible.

Interference-suppression resistors, 
screening
Each flashover is a source of interference 
due to its pulse-shaped discharge. Interfer-
ence-suppression resistors in the high-volt-
age circuit limit the peak current during
 discharge. In order to minimize the interfer-
ence radiation from the high-voltage circuit,
the suppression resistors should be installed
as close as possible to the source of inter -
ference.

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Transmission in the Drivetrain

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Every motor vehicle engine operates within a
specific speed range which is limited by the
idle speed and the maximum speed. Power
and torque are not offered uniformly and the
maximum values are only available in partial
ranges. 
Transmissions therefore convert the engine
torque and the engine speed in accordance
with vehicle traction requirements in such
a way that the power remains roughly
 constant. They also allow the different
 directions of rotation for forward and
 reverse travel.

Transmission in the  Drivetrain

Internal-combustion engines do not have a
constant torque and power characteristic over
the speed range available to them (idle to high
idle speed). The optimum “elastic” speed range
lies between maximum torque and maximum
power (Figure 1). For this reason, a vehicle
cannot start off from a state of rest where the
engine is stopped. To do this, it requires a
power take-up element (e.g. clutch).

Furthermore, the available engine torque 
is not sufficient for gradients and powerful
acceleration. For this purpose, a suitable gear
ratio for adapting traction and torque and for
optimizing fuel consumption must be made
available. 

Engines only have one direction of rotation 
as well, with the result that they require a
changeover facility for forward and reverse
travel.

As Figure 2 shows, the transmission is situ-

ated in a central position on the drivetrain
and thus substantially influences the drive-
train’s effectiveness.

In addition, an analysis of the losses that

arise in the drivetrain show that, after the
engine, it is the transmission which offers
the most possibilities for optimization
based on NEFZ driving cycle (Figure 3).

Transmission History 1

Benz patent motor carriage from 1886 with
belt and chain drives
When Daimler, Maybach, and Benz launched
their first road vehicles, pioneers of motive
power engineering had already developed the
machine parts required for power transmission
to a considerable extent. Names such as
Leonardo da Vinci, Dürer, Galileo, Hooke,
Bernoulli, Euler, Grashof, and Bach had played
a significant role in these developments. 

Power transmission in an automobile must
guarantee the functions of starting and engine-
speed and torque conversion for forward and
reverse travel. These functions call for actuators
and shifting elements which intervene in the
power-flow and perform engine-speed and
torque conversion. 

The first operational Benz patent motor car-
riage appeared in 1886. It was the first three-
wheel vehicle to be conceived in its entirety
specifically for motorized road traffic. It may well
have had just one gear, but it did not have a
start-up clutch. In order to get the carriage mov-
ing at all, it was necessary to push it or crank it
with the flywheel.

A single-cylinder four-stroke engine with a
displacement of 984 cc and a power output of
0.88 HP (0.65 kW) served as the drive unit for
this Benz three-wheeler.

Benz utilized the following machine parts to
transfer the motive force of his engine to the
road:

The end of the engine’s crankshaft held the
flywheel, which ensured that the engine ran more
smoothly and which could also be used to crank
the engine. Since the engine was built over the
rear axle, a bevel gear arranged at right angles
transmitted power in a small space to a belt
drive, which reduced the rotational speed slightly
to an intermediate shaft. Finally, a chain drive re-
duced the speed further to the powered axle.

The belt and chain drives dating from the ori-
gins of the automobile were gradually replaced
by a gear train. But, today, they are experiencing
a renaissance in the form of the continuously
variable transmission (CVT). A CVT transmis-
sion consists of a variator with two V-pulleys
and a flexible steel push-belt. As soon as the
pressure of the transmission oil displaces the
moving V-pulley halves, this changes the posi-
tion of the steel push-belt between the two pul-
leys and with it the gear ratio. This technology
allows continuous adjustment of the gear ratio
without interrupting the power transmission and
operation of the engine in its most favorable
power range.

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Transmission Requirements

Transmission Requirements

Every motor vehicle places quite specific
 demands on its transmission. Each of the
transmission types differ in terms of design
and associated features. The objectives or
main points of emphasis in transmission
 development can be divided into the follow-
ing categories:
(cid:2) comfort and convenience,
(cid:2) fuel consumption,
(cid:2) driveability,
(cid:2) installation space, and
(cid:2) production costs.

Comfort and Convenience
Essential requirements in terms of comfort
and convenience are, in addition to a smooth
gear change without engine-speed jumps,
comfortable gearshifts irrespective of engine
load and operating conditions, and a low level
of noise. Nor should there be any loss of con-
venience over the entire lifetime of the trans-
mission.

Fuel Consumption
The following transmission characteristics are
essential in keeping fuel consumption as low
as possible:
(cid:2) large transmission-ratio range,
(cid:2) high mechanical effi-

ciency,

(cid:2) “intelligent” shifting

1

1

Driveability
The following transmission functions ensure
good driveability: 
(cid:2) shifting points adapted to the relevant

 driving situation,

(cid:2) recognition of the type of driver,
(cid:2) high accelerating performance,
(cid:2) engine braking action during downhill dri-

ving,

(cid:2) suppression of gear change during

 cornering at high speed, and

(cid:2) recognition of winter road conditions.

Installation Space
Depending on the type of drive, there are dif-
ferent stipulations for the space available: 
Thus, the transmission for a rear-wheel
drive should be as small as possible in terms
of diameter, while the transmission for a
front-wheel drive should be as low as possible
in overall length. There are also precisely de-
fined specifications for satisfying require-
ments in a crash test.

Production Costs
The preconditions for the lowest production
costs possible are:
(cid:2) production in large-scale numbers,
(cid:2) simple control-system layout and

 automated assembly.

Manual Transmission

81

Manual  Transmission

Application
Manually shifted transmissions are the sim-
plest and most inexpensive transmissions for
car drivers (final users). For this reason, they
still dictate the market in Europe. 

Due to increasing engine performance and
higher vehicle weight together with decreas-
ing cd values, 5-speed manual transmissions
have been superseding the previously domi-
nant 4-speed manual transmissions since the
beginning of the 1980s. And now the  
6-speed transmission is virtually standard.

This development provided, on the one hand,
safe starting and good acceleration and, on
the other hand, lower engine speeds at higher
road speeds, and thus reduced fuel consump-
tion.

2

Power-flow in a standard drive (5-speed transmission)

Design
The design of a manually shifted trans -
mission (Figures 1 and 2) incorporates
(cid:2) a single-plate dry clutch as the power take-
up element and for interrupting the power-
flow during gear changes,
(cid:2) gears mounted on two shafts,
(cid:2) positive clutches as shifting elements,
 actuated via a synchronizer assembly.

Features
The main features of the manual
 transmission are:
(cid:2) high efficiency,
(cid:2) compact, light design,
(cid:2) economical construction,
(cid:2) absence of comfortable operation

(clutch pedal, manual gear changing),

(cid:2) driver-dependent shifting strategy,
(cid:2) interruption of tractive force during

gearshifting.

Automated Shift Transmission (AST)

Automated Shift  
Transmission (AST)

Application
Automated shift transmissions (AST), or
 automated manual transmissions (AMT),
help to simplify transmission operation and
increase economic operation. They are an
add-on solution to conventional manual
transmissions. The previously manual
gearshifts are now performed by pneumatic,
hydraulic, or electrical means. Bosch favors
the electrical solution described below
 (Figure 1). 

Design and Operating Concept
The AST is made possible by electronic clutch
management (ECM), supplemented by two
servomotors (selection and shifting motors)
for selection and shifting. Depending on the
system used, the required electrical control
signals can be issued directly from a shift lever
actuated by the driver or from an intermediate
electronic control system.

Thanks to the electric-motor-driven
 actuators of the AST concept, it is possible
at  little expense to achieve automation of the
transmission complete with the associated in-
crease in convenience. An important argu-
ment for the transmission manufacturers
here is the ability to reuse existing production
facilities.

In the simplest system, the mechanical link-
age is merely replaced by a remote switch.
The shift lever (tip lever or switch with H
gearshift pattern) just outputs electrical
 signals. Power take-up and clutching are 
performed as in the manual transmission,
partly linked to a gearshift recommendation. 

In fully automatic systems, the transmission
and power take-up element are automated. A
lever or tip switch is the control element for
the driver. The driver can skip the automatic
facility with a manual setting or with +/– but-
tons. Automatically controlling a multispeed
transmission requires a complex shifting
strategy which also takes into account the
present total running resistance (determined
by load and road profile). 

To support the synchronization process in
the interruption of tractive force during the
gearshift operation, an electronic engine-
control facility (depending on the shift type)
automatically closes the throttle briefly.

The design of automated shift transmissions
is characterized by the following features: 
(cid:2) basic design as for manual transmissions,
(cid:2) actuation of clutch and gear change by

 actuators (pneumatic, hydraulic or  electric-
motor-driven), and
(cid:2) electronic control.

Features
The main features of the automated shift
transmission are:
(cid:2) compact design, 
(cid:2) high efficiency,
(cid:2) adaptation to existing transmission

 possible,

(cid:2) more competitively priced than automatic

or CVT transmissions,

(cid:2) simple operation,
(cid:2) suitable shifting strategies for achieving 
optimum fuel consumption and best
 consumption figures, and

(cid:2) interruption of tractive force during

gearshifting.

are mounted directly on the transmission.
They have a brush holder with integrated
connector. This also contains an integrated
double Hall-effect sensor (IC) with a resolu-
tion of 40 increments per engine revolution.
A Hall-effect sensor with output channels for
the rotor angle (lateral pulse) and the
 direction (high and low) can detect the
 position of the output shaft.

A 20-pin magnet on the rotor shaft allows a

resolution of 9° per increment. In relation to
the transmission step-up ratio, it is possible
to obtain a resolution of between 0.59° per
increment and 0.20° per increment at the
output. Depending on the requirement, the
gear has a crank or eccentric drive. The
worm-gear pair has 1 to 4 teeth.

EC Motors
EC motors are brushless, permanently
 excited, electronically commutated DC
 motors and are used as an alternative to the
DC motors. They are equipped with a rotor-
position sensor, supplied with direct current
via control and power electronics (Figure 7),
and characterized by long lifetime and the
minimal space they take up.

Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)

Dual-Clutch Transmission
(DCT)

Application
Dual-clutch transmissions, DCT (Figure 1),
are seen as the further development of the
AST. They operate without interruption of
tractive force, a major drawback of the AST.
The DCT’s main benefit lies in its lower
fuel consumption compared with automated
shift transmissions.

The dual-clutch transmission was used
for the first time in 1992 in motor racing
(Porsche). However, owing to the high
 computation effort required in the control
system to ensure a comfortable overlapping
gearshift, it failed to make it into mass
 production.

With the availability of high-power

 computers, several manufacturers (e.g. VW,
Audi) are now working on introducing dual-
clutch transmissions for mass production.

1

Since its requirements profile matches that of
an automatic transmission in terms of conve-
nience and functionality, it has found its
niche in the superior, luxury vehicle
 categories. 

Dual-clutch transmissions also match the
wishes of vehicle manufacturers for modular
concepts since both manually shifted and au-
tomated shift transmissions can be manufac-
tured on the same production line.

Design
The design of dual-clutch transmissions is
characterized by the following features:
(cid:2) basic design as for manual transmissions,
(cid:2) gears mounted on three shafts,
(cid:2) two clutches, 
(cid:2) actuation of clutch and shifting elements

via transmission-shift control and
 actuators.

Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)

87

Operating Concept
The dual-clutch transmission operates as fol-
lows: 

The gear wheels assigned to the gear steps
are divided into groups of even and uneven
gears. Although it is similar in terms of basic
design to a conventional manual countershaft
transmission, there is one crucial difference:
Even the main shaft is split – namely into a
solid shaft and a surrounding hollow shaft,
both coupled to a gear train. 

Each partial shaft is assigned its own clutch at
the transmission input. Since now two gears
are engaged during the gear change (both the
active gear and the neighboring, preselected
gear), a faster change between the gears is

thus possible. In this way, the gear change can
take place between the two partial transmis-
sions, in the same way as in an automatic
transmission, without interruption of tractive
force (Figure 2).

Features
The main features of the dual-clutch
 transmission are:
(cid:2) similar levels of convenience to an

 automatic transmission,

(cid:2) high efficiency,
(cid:2) no interruption of tractive force during

gearshifting,

(cid:2) skipping of a gear possible,
(cid:2) takes up more space than an AST,
(cid:2) high bearing forces, solid construction.

Automatic Transmission (AT)

Automatic Transmission (AT)

Application
Automatic power-shift transmissions, or sim-
ply automatic transmissions (AT) perform
power take-up, select the gear ratios, and
carry out the gearshifts themselves. A hydro-
dynamic converter acts as the power take-up
element.

Design and Operating Concept
Transmission with Ravigneaux Planetary-
Gear Set
The four-shaft planetary-gear set known as
the Ravigneaux set is the basis of many auto-
matic 4-speed transmissions. Figure 1 shows
the schematic, the shifting logic, and a speed-
ladder diagram for this transmission. The
transmission schematic clearly shows the lay-
out of the gear wheels and shifting elements.
Sun gears B, C and planetary-gear carrier S
can be connected via clutches CB, CC and CS
to shaft A, which is guided by the converter
turbine into the transmission. Shafts S and C
can be connected with the aid of brakes BS
and BC to the transmission housing.

A planetary-gear set of this type has a kine-
matic degree of freedom of 2. This means
that, when two speeds are specified, all the
other speeds are established. The individual
gears are shifted in such a way that via two
shifting elements the speeds of two shafts are
defined either as drive speed ndr or as housing
speed nC = 0 rpm.

The speed-ladder diagram clearly shows the
speed ratios in the transmission. The speeds
are entered upwards on the speed ladders for
the individual shafts of the overlapping or
shift transmission. The gaps of the speed lad-
ders are derived from the gear ratios or num-
bers of teeth such that the speeds belonging
to a particular point of operation can be con-
nected by a straight line. 

At a specific drive speed, the five reference
lines characterize the speed ratios in four for-
ward gears and one reverse gear.
Only the three shafts B, C and S between the
input shaft “in” (corresponding to A) and the
output shaft “out” are available for the differ-
ent gearshifts. All three shafts can be con-

Transmission with 
Lepelletier Planetary-Gear Set
A more elegant way of shifting five and more
gears was devised by the French  engineer Le-
pelletier. He expanded the  Ravigneaux set to
include a range-change transmission for only
two shafts of the  Ravigneaux set in order to
drive them with means other than the drive
speed. 

The unusual feature of the Lepelletier plane-
tary-gear set as set out in Figure 2 (following
page) lies in the fact that the additional three-
shaft planetary-gear set reduces the speed of
shaft D in respect to that of shaft A. In the
first three gears of this 6-speed automatic
transmission, the shifting logic corresponds
to the logic of the 4-speed Ravigneaux set.
The gear ratios are greater by the orbit ratio
of the internal gear to the carrier at the fixed
sun gear of the additional planetary-gear set. 

In 4th and 5th gears, shaft S is connected via
clutch KS to shaft A. It rotates faster than
shafts B and C. The transmission ratios are
produced from the gearshifts in 4th gear: 
S = A and B = D and in 5th gear S = A and
C = D. Without the additional transmission
from A to D, the gear ratios in 3rd, 4th and
5th gears would be identical and all i = 1. 
The 6th gear of this 6-speed automatic
transmission corresponds in terms of the
shifting logic again to the 4th gear of the  
4-speed automatic transmission. Even the
gearshifts of the reverse gears are identical
in these 4-speed and 6-speed automatic
transmissions.

nected to input shaft A, but then construc-
tively only two shafts can still be connected to
the transmission housing. 

The simultaneous shifting of two brakes is
not useful for gearshifts as this blocks the
transmission. Of equally little use is the
 simultaneous connection of one shaft to the
housing and to the input shaft. The simulta-
neous shifting of two clutches always results
in the direct gear (i = 1). 

This retains exactly the five gears shown in

the shifting logic and in the speed diagram.
Beyond the numbers of teeth that are possible
within the framework of the installation con-
ditions, the designer still has the option of
changing the individual gear  ratios, where a
direct gear is always specified with i = 1.

Finally, these transmissions still make it possi-
ble with simple gearshifts to skip gears by cut-
ting in one shifting element and cutting out
another shifting element. It is possible to shift
from 1st gear into 2nd or 3rd gear, and from
4th gear into 3rd or 2nd gear. From 2nd and
3rd gear, all other gears can be reached with
simple gearshifts.

However, it is not possible to shift more than
four forward gears with the Ravigneaux set.
An automatic transmission with five gears
therefore requires either another basic
 transmission or a front-mounted or rear-
mounted range-change unit to expand the
Ravigneaux set. But such an expansion stage
requires at least two shifting elements. 

An example of this is the 5HP19 automatic

transmission from ZF, which has three
clutches, four brakes, and a one-way clutch to
shift only five forward gears.
Obviously, it is also possible to attain more
than 5 gears with range-change units but
shifting effort then becomes increasingly
more pronounced and gearshifts of several
shifting elements for one gear change cannot
be avoided.

90

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Automatic Transmission (AT)

The 6-speed automatic transmission (Fig-
ure 3) also makes possible wide gear steps
with simple gearshifts, which can be neces-
sary particularly in the case of rapid down-
shifts.
The Lepelletier planetary-gear set therefore
differs from the Ravigneaux set only in that it
has an additional planetary-gear set with a
fixed gear ratio. The number of shifting ele-
ments remains the same. They are simply
used repeatedly for the additional gears. In
terms of space, weight, and cost, this trans-
mission is more suitable than a 5-speed auto-
matic transmission. With the numbers of
teeth shown in Figure 2, this 6-speed auto-
matic transmission achieves a setting range of
(cid:2) = 6 with easily shiftable gear spacings.

The additional planetary-gear set consists of
sun gear E, internal gear A, and planetary-
gear carrier D and is used in reverse gear and
the first 5 gears as a fixed ratio stage. Shaft E is
permanently connected as reaction member 
to the transmission housing. If this connection 

were removed and replaced by an additional
brake BE, the vehicle could be started with this
brake instead of the  converter.

Power Take-Up Elements
In the majority of automatic transmissions
which are geared towards convenience, a
 hydrodynamic converter adopts the power
take-up function. A hydrodynamic converter
is an ideal power take-up element because of
the way it works as a turbo element. In order
to minimize converter losses during vehicle
operation, it is however (as often as is possi-
ble) locked up with the torque converter
lockup clutch (TCLC).

When used with very high-torque turbo-
 diesel engines, the converter can no longer 
be designed to achieve optimum results for 
all operating states. A drive of this type
 requires a relatively soft converter character-
istic for safe starting in cold conditions. The
maximum pump torque may only have an 
effect at high speeds so that the drag losses 
do not stall the weak engine without suffi-

cient charge-air pressure. At normal operat-
ing temperatures and at speeds at which suffi-
cient charge-air pressure is available, a hard
converter characteristic with a steep rise in
pump torque as engine speed increases is 
advantageous.

Series applications with fast and accurate
pressure control now also make it possible to
start up comfortably with friction clutches. A
good example of this is the Audi A6 with the
continuously variable Multitronic transmis-
sion. 

Pressure control and heat dissipation can
be better achieved with a brake than with a
clutch. It should therefore also be possible to
obtain comfortable starting with the brake.
Even during the gear changes, a slipping brake
can remove the load from the other shifting 
elements in the same way as a converter.

Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF)
Automatic transmissions place exacting
 demands on the ATF (automatic trans mission
fluid):
(cid:2) increased pressure-absorption capability,
(cid:2) good viscosity-temperature characteristics,
(cid:2) high resistance to aging,

(cid:2) low foaming tendency,
(cid:2) compatibility with sealing materials,

These requirements must be guaranteed 

in the oil pan in a temperature range of
–30...+150°C. Temperatures of up to 400°C
are briefly and locally possible between the
clutch plates during a gearshift.
The transmission fluid is specially adapted 
for fault-free operation of the automatic
transmission. A series of chemical sub-
stances (additives) is added to the basic oil 
for this purpose. The main additives are:
(cid:2) friction modifiers, which influence the 
frictional behavior of the shifting  
elements,

(cid:2) antioxidants for reducing thermo oxidative

aging at high temperatures,

(cid:2) dispersants for preventing deposits in the

(cid:2) foam inhibitors for preventing the buildup

transmission,

of oil foam,

(cid:2) corrosion inhibitors for preventing

 corrosion of transmission components
when condensation water is formed, and
(cid:2) seal-swell agents, which control the swelling
of sealing materials (elastomers) under the
influence of oil to defined levels.

Automatic Transmission (AT)

GM established the first specification for ATF
back in 1949. Typical technical data for SAE
viscosity classes in accordance with DIN
51 512 are:
Flash point
Pour point
Viscosity index 
Kin. viscosity:

(> 180°C)
(< –45°C)
(VI > 190)
(at +40°C)
(at +100°C)

Dyn. viscosity:

37 cSt 
17 cSt
17 000 cP (at –40°C)
13 300 cP (at –30°C)
11 000 cP (at –20°C)

In the meantime, automatic transmissions are
increasingly being filled with lifetime fluid,
thus rendering unnecessary a change of fluid.

Oil Pump
The transmission requires an oil pump (Fig-
ure 4) to build up a control pressure. This
pump is driven by the engine. At the same
time, the oil-pump drive power reduces the
transmission efficiency. The following equa-
tion applies here:

Pump output = pressure (cid:5) flow

Figure 5 shows the output characteristics of a
gear pump (1) and a radial piston pump (2)
in comparison. Possibilities for optimization
in the oil-pump range are  offered by a vari-
able flow or a controllable pump pressure:

Variable Pump Flow
The particular features of variable pump flow
are as follows:
(cid:2) The design creates a sufficiently high flow

to fill the clutch at idle speed.

(cid:2) An additional displacement at higher

speeds causes a loss of output.

(cid:2) The variable-capacity pump enables the
pump output to be adapted as required.

(cid:2) However, variable pump flow has the draw-
back of being expensive and susceptible to
failure.

Controllable Pump Pressure
The particular features of controllable pump
pressure are as follows:
(cid:2) The pump pressure is adapted to the
torque to be transferred in each case.
(cid:2) Main-pressure control allows effective

 operation (by means of the actuator) close
to the clutch slipping point.

Torque Converter
The torque converter (Figure 6) is a power
take-up aid, which works as an additional
gear in the start-up range and also serves to
damp vibrations. It was the hydraulic con-
verter with centripetal turbine which first en-
abled automatic transmissions to be used in
passenger cars. The most important  elements
of a converter are:
(cid:2) pump (driven by the engine),
(cid:2) turbine,
(cid:2) stator on the one-way clutch, and
(cid:2) fluid (for the transfer of torque).

6

Torque converter (section)

2

The impeller sets the fluid from the hub in
motion in an outward direction. There the
fluid hits the turbine, which directs it in-
wards. The fluid from the turbine in the hub
area then hits the stator, which diverts it back
to the pump (Figure 7).

In the converter area (ν < 85%), the
 turbine torque is increased by the reaction
torque at the stator. In the clutch area, the sta-
tor one-way clutch is released and there is no
further increase in torque. The maximum ef-
ficiency is < 97% (Figure 8).

A transmission of power via the converter can
only take place when slip occurs between the
impeller and the turbine wheel. This is low in
most vehicle operating states, ranging from
2...10%. However, this slip causes a loss in
power output and thereby increased vehicle
fuel consumption. A torque converter lockup
clutch must therefore always cut in when the
converter is not required for start-up or
torque conversion (see also section “Con-
trolled Torque Converter Lockup Clutch”).
This is a multiplate clutch, which connects
the impeller to the turbine wheel by frictional
locking.

Automatic Transmission (AT)

Multiplate Clutches
Multiplate clutches (Figure 9) facilitate shift-
ing without an interruption of tractive force
and support the torque in the gear in which
they are being actuated.

The following problems can occur in
 connection with multiplate clutches:
(cid:2) combustion at high temperatures,
(cid:2) supply of fluid with rotating clutches, and
(cid:2) pressure increase caused by rotation speed.

The lining and steel plates of the clutches and
brakes take on the dynamic torque and the
shifting energy during the gearshift and the
load torque to be transferred after the
gearshift. In order to ensure high gear-shift 
sophistication (convenience), the friction
 linings must demonstrate coefficients of
 friction which are as constant as possible and
not dependent on temperature and load.

The friction linings in automatic transmis-

sions have a cellulose support structure 
(paper linings). Added aramide fibers (high-
strength plastic) ensure temperature stability.
Further constituents are mineral aggregates,
graphite, or friction particles for influencing
the coefficient of friction. The entire lining is
soaked in phenol resin to give it its mechani-
cal strength. The steel plates are made of
cold-rolled sheet steel.

The friction process occurs in the fluid
layer between the lining and steel plates.
The friction lining maintains this fluid layer
through its porosity and by supplying cooling
fluid.

Planetary-Gear Sets
The planetary-gear set (Figure 10) is the heart
of the automatic transmission. Its function is
to adjust the gear ratios and to ensure con-
stant power transmission. A planetary-gear
set is made up of the following components:
(cid:2) A central gear wheel (sun gear).
(cid:2) Several (usually three to five) planet gears,
which can rotate around their own axes
and also around the sun gear. The planet
gears are held in place by the planetary-
gear carrier, which can rotate around the
central axis.

(cid:2) An internal gear, which surrounds and

 encloses the planet gears. This internal gear
can also rotate around the central axis.

Planetary-gear sets are used in automatic
transmissions for the following reasons:
(cid:2) The power density of planetary-gear sets is
very high since the power is transmitted in
parallel via several planet gears. Planetary-
gear sets are therefore highly compact and
low in weight.

(cid:2) No free radial forces occur in the plane-

 replaced by cost-effective plain bearings.

(cid:2) Multiplate clutches, multiplate brakes,

band brakes, and one-way clutches can be
arranged concentrically to the planetary-
gear set, thus providing more space for the
hydraulic control system.

Different planetary-gear set combinations are
used in transmissions:

Two types of planetary-gear set have been
successfully used in automatic transmissions
and are characterized by the following easy-
to-distinguish features: 

Ravigneaux Set
In the Ravigneaux set (Figure 11), two differ-
ent planetary sets and sun gears operate in a
single internal gear.

Simpson Set
In the Simpson set (Figure 12), two planetary
sets and internal gears run on one joint sun
gear.

Parking Lock
The function of the parking lock (Figure 13)
is to secure the vehicle against rolling off. Its
reliable operation is therefore fundamental to
safety.

The driver must press the brake pedal
 before the selector lever can be moved from
the P (Park) position. This mechanism pre-
vents the vehicle from being set in motion by
accidental operation of the selector lever.

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)

Continuously Variable
 Transmission (CVT)

Application
Drive concepts with continuously variable
transmissions (CVT) are characterized by
high driving convenience, outstanding ride
characteristics, and low fuel consumption. 
VDT (Van Doorne’s Transmissie) has for

many years specialized in developing CVT
components and prototype transmissions.
Since its takeover of VDT in 1995, Bosch now
covers the entire field of CVT system devel-
opments through to complete drivetrain-
management systems. All the continuously
variable automatic transmissions listed in
Table 1 are operated with a push-belt (Figure
1). One exception is the Audi Multitronic
with a link-chain manufactured by LuK (Fig-
ure 2).

The main components of a CVT can be
 activated by an electrohydraulic module. In
addition to the push-belt – in mass production
since 1985 – pulleys, pumps, and electrohy-
draulic modules are being developed for vol-
ume production launch. There are different
types of push-belt for mid-range engine
torques up to 400 Nm (e.g. Nissan Murano
V6 with 3.5 l displacement and max. 350 Nm
at 4000 rpm, with converter).
The know-how within the

Bosch Group provides the
software for optimum CVT
activation. Naturally there is
full flexibility with regard
to software sharing so that
vehicle manufacturers can
also develop and imple-
ment special functions
themselves.

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)

99

Design
The converter or the multiplate clutch acts as
the power take-up element, and the reverse
gear is shifted via a planetary-gear set.

The gear ratio is continuously varied with  
V-pulleys and a belt or a chain (variator).

High-pressure hydraulics provide the neces-
sary contact pressure and variator adjust-
ment.

All the functions are controlled by the elec-
trohydraulic control system. The various
components of the CVT transmission are de-
picted in Figure 8.

Features
One advantage of CVT transmissions is that
they do not cause any interruption of tractive
force when the gear ratio is changed. These
transmissions offer a high level of convenience
since gearshifts are not necessary.

In the entire engine map, operation is
matched to optimum fuel consumption/
maximum acceleration. A high ratio span is
also possible. 

Although the high-pressure pump requires a
certain level of drive power, the overall effi-
ciency is satisfactory.

Transmissions for Motor Vehicles

Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)

CVT Components
Variator
The variator consists of two V-pulleys which
move in relation to each other (Figures 9 and
10).

The pressure p of the transmission fluid
moves the moving parts of the variator (1) in
relation to each other. This alters the position
of the push-belt (3) between the two pulleys
and changes the gear ratio.

As power transmission is based solely on
the friction between the belt and the variator,
this type of adjustment requires a high system
pressure.

Push-Belt
The company Van Doorne’s Transmissie
holds a worldwide patent for the push-belt.
Figure 11 shows the different types of belt
and their areas of application in relation to
the engine torque to be transferred.

The push-belt (Figure 12) consists of push el-
ements 2 mm thick and 24...30 mm wide,
which are arranged at an inclination angle
of 11° to each other. The chain is held by two
packs, each with 8 to 12 steel belts. The coeffi-
cient of friction of the chain is at least 0.9.

The following nomenclature is used for the
belt designations:

24/12/1.5/208.8

(cid:4) Belt diameter
(cid:4) Thickness of belts

(cid:4) Number of belts

(cid:4) Width of push elements in mm

Link-chain
Instead of the push-belt usually used in CVT
transmissions, Audi uses a link-chain manu-
factured by the company LuK in its Multi-
tronic transmission (this chain is based on
the pin chain manufactured by the company
P.I.V. Reimers). 

This link-chain is made completely of steel

and yet is almost as flexible as a V-belt. It is
composed of various positions of links next
to each other and therefore of such  robust de-
sign that it can transfer very high torques
(transferable engine torque 350 Nm) and
forces.

The chain (Figure 13) consists of 1025 indi-
vidual links, each with 13...14 chain links
lined up next to each other. Pins with a width
of 37 mm and an inclination angle of 11°
connect the links (1) to each other. The ends
of the pins (2) press against the conical sur-
faces in the variator. 

The tractive force of the chain is trans-
ferred to the variator pulleys at the support
points created. The mini slip created in the
process is so minimal that the pins are subject
to wear of no more than one to two tenths of
a millimeter over the entire working life of
the transmission.

The link-chain has the further advantage

that it can be routed over a circumference
that is smaller still than other belts. By run-
ning on this minimum wrap diameter, it has
the capacity to transfer maximum forces and
torques. In this event, only nine pairs of pins
are in contact with the inside surfaces of the
pulleys. However, the specific contact pres-
sure is so high that they do not slip even
 under maximum load.

CVT Oil Pump
Since the process of adjusting the pulleys
in the CVT requires a high fluid pressure,
a high-power oil pump is used to generate
this pressure (Figure 14).

Transmission History 2

(cid:4)

Transmission history 2

Daimler/Maybach Steel-Wheel Carriage from
1889 with Four-Speed Transmission
Power transmission in an automobile must
 guarantee the functions of starting, engine-
speed, and torque conversion for forward and
reverse travel. These functions call for actuators
and shifting elements which intervene in the
power-flow and perform engine-speed and
torque  conversion. 

In the very early days of automobile history,
many vehicles transferred their engine’s motive
force to the road with belt and chain drives.
Only in the output stage, the final drive, were
gear and chain drives soon to be in use due to
the high torques involved. 

The steel-wheel carriage from Daimler and
his designer Maybach from 1889 was the first
four-wheel vehicle with an internal-combustion
engine not to be simply a converted horse-
drawn carriage, but to be conceived in its
 entirety specifically for motorized road traffic.
The power-flow of its vertically mounted two-
cylinder V-engine with a power output of 2 HP
(1.45 kW) was already transferred to the pow-
ered axle with a clutch, a four-speed manually
shifted gear transmission, and a differential. A
gear transmission could specifically carry out
the conversion of rotational speed, torque, and
 direction of rotation in the tightest of spaces.

(cid:4) Daimler/Maybach steel-wheel carriage from 1889

with its four-speed transmission 
(source: DaimlerChrysler Classic)

The four-speed transmission to be operated
 using two shift levers consisted of different
straight-toothed gear pairs, one pair of which
could always be engaged with the aid of two
sliding-gear clusters. The top speed that could
be reached ranged between 5 km/h (1st gear)
and 16 km/h (4th gear). For the purpose of
starting and shifting, the power transmission
from the engine to the transmission could be
 interrupted with a bevel clutch.

Despite the introduction of the variable-ratio
gear transmission, the belt drive maintained its
position for some time as the power take-up ele-
ment in the subsequent course of vehicle devel-
opment because it permitted a certain starting
slip and a greater spacing to the other drivetrain
components. There were also combinations of
belt drives, manual gear transmissions, and
chain drives. The chain drive remained in use
in passenger cars until roughly 1910. But as
 engine power output continued to increase,
there was no longer any way past the variable-
ratio gear transmission with bevel clutch on
 account of the high forces that were created.
After 1920 the positive connection (with
 constantly engaged gears) was established by
displacing dog clutches with low displacement
travel. Then helical gears and synchronization
became standard in manually shifted transmis-
sions. Finally, there came the introduction of
 automatic transmissions, which are usually fitted
with planetary-gear sets on account of the high
power density.

Motor-vehicle safety

Safety systems

Motor-vehicle safety

In addition to the components of the drive-
train (engine, transmission), which provide
the vehicle with its means of forward motion,
the vehicle systems that limit movement and
retard the vehicle also have an important role
to play. Without them, safe use of the vehicle
in road traffic would not be possible. Further-
more, systems that protect vehicle occupants
in the event of an accident are also becoming
increasingly important.

Safety systems

There are a many factors that affect vehicle
safety in road traffic situations:
(cid:2) the condition of the vehicle (e.g. level of

equipment, condition of tires, component
wear),

(cid:2) the weather, road surface and traffic condi-
tions (e.g. side winds, type of road surface
and density of traffic), and

(cid:2) the capabilities of the driver, i.e. his/her

driving skills and physical and mental con-
dition.

In the past, it was essentially only the braking
system (apart, of course, from the vehicle
lights) consisting of brake pedal, brake lines
and wheel brakes that contributed 
to vehicle safety. Over the course of time
though, more and more systems that actively
intervene in braking-system operation have
been added. Because of their active interven-

1

Safety when driving on roads (concepts and influencing variables)

Road safety

tion, these safety systems are also referred to
as active safety systems. 

The motor-vehicle safety systems that are
found on the most up-to-date vehicles sub-
stantially improve their safety.

The brakes are an essential component of 
a motor vehicle. They are indispensable for
safe use of the vehicle in road traffic. At the
slow speeds and with the small amount of
traffic that were encountered in the early
years of motoring, the demands placed on the
braking system were far less exacting than
they are today. Over the course of time, brak-
ing systems have become more and more
highly developed. In the final analysis, the
high speeds that cars can be driven at  today
are only possible because there are  reliable
braking systems which are capable 
of slowing down the vehicle and bringing it
safely to a halt even in hazardous situations.
Consequently, the braking system is a key
part of a vehicle’s safety systems.

As in all other areas of automotive engineer-
ing, electronics have also become established
in the safety systems. The demands now
placed on safety systems can only be met with
the aid of electronic equipment.

Active safety systems 
These systems help to prevent accidents 
and thus make a preventative contribution to
road safety. Examples of active vehicle safety
systems include
(cid:2) ABS (Antilock Braking System),
(cid:2) TCS (Traction Control System), and 
(cid:2) ESP (Electronic Stability Program). 

These safety systems stabilize the vehicle’s
handling response in critical situations and
thus maintain its steerability.

Passive safety systems
These systems are designed to protect  vehicle
occupants from serious injury in the event of
an accident. They reduce the risk of injury
and thus the severity of the consequences of
an accident. 

Examples of passive safety systems are the
seat-belts required by law, and airbags –
which can now be fitted in various positions
inside the vehicle such as in front of or at the
side of the occupants. 

Apart from their contribution to vehicle
safety, systems such as Adaptive Cruise
 Control (ACC) essentially offer added conve-
nience by maintaining the distance from the
vehicle in front by automatically throttling
back the engine or applying the brakes.

Fig. 1 illustrates the safety systems and
 components that are found on modern-day
vehicles equipped with the most advanced
technology.

106

Motor-vehicle safety

Basics of vehicle operation

Basics of vehicle operation

Driver behavior
The first step in adapting vehicle response 
to reflect the driver and his/her capabilities is
to analyze driver behavior as a whole.  Driver
behavior is broken down into two  basic cate-
gories:
(cid:2) vehicle guidance, and
(cid:2) response to vehicle instability.

The essential feature of the “vehicle guidance”
aspect is the driver’s aptitude in anticipating
subsequent developments; this translates into
the ability to analyze current driving condi-
tions and the associated interrelationships in
order to accurately gauge such factors as:
(cid:2) the amount of initial steering input re-
quired to maintain consistently optimal
cornering lines when cornering,

(cid:2) the points at which braking must be initi-
ated in order to stop within available dis-
tances, and

(cid:2) when acceleration should be started in order
to overtake slower vehicles without risk.

Steering angle, braking and throttle applica-
tion are vital elements within the guidance
process. The precision with which these 
functions are discharged depends upon 
the driver’s level of experience.

1

Overall system of “Driver – Vehicle – Environment”

While stabilizing the vehicle (response to vehi-
cle instability), the driver determines that the
actual path being taken deviates from the in-
tended course (the road’s path) and that the
originally estimated control inputs (steering
angle, accelerator pedal pressure) must be
 revised to avoid traction loss or prevent the 
vehicle leaving the road. The amount of stabi-
lization (correction) response necessary after
initiation of any given maneuver is inversely
proportional to the driver’s ability to estimate
initial guidance inputs; more driver ability
leads to greater vehicle stability. Progressively
higher levels of correspondence between the
initial control input (steering angle) and the
actual cornering line produce progressively
lower correction requirements; the vehicle
 reacts to these minimal corrections with
 “linear” response (driver input is transferred 
to the road surface proportionally, with no
substantial deviations).

Experienced drivers can accurately antici-
pate both how the vehicle will react to their
control inputs and how this reactive motion
will combine with predictable external fac-
tors and forces (when approaching curves
and road works etc.). Novices not only need
more time to complete this adaptive process,
their results will also harbor a greater poten-
tial for error. The conclusion is that inexperi-

enced drivers concentrate most of their at-
tention on the stabilization aspect of driving.
When an unforeseen development arises
for driver and vehicle (such as an unexpect-
edly sharp curve in combination with re-
stricted vision, etc.), the former may react in-
correctly, and the latter can respond by going
into a skid. Under these circumstances, the
vehicle responds non-linearly and trans-
gresses beyond its physical stability limits, 
so that the driver can no longer anticipate the
line it will ultimately take. In such cases, it is
impossible for either the novice or the experi-
enced driver to retain control over his/her ve-
hicle.

Accident causes and prevention
Human error is behind the vast majority 
of all road accidents resulting in injury.
 Accident statistics reveal that driving at an in-
appropriate speed is the primary cause for
most accidents. Other accident sources are 
(cid:2) incorrect use of the road,
(cid:2) failure to maintain the safety margin to the

preceding vehicle,

(cid:2) errors concerning right-of-way and traffic

priority,

(cid:2) errors occurring when making turns, and
(cid:2) driving under the influence of alcohol.

Technical deficiencies (lighting, tires, brakes,
etc.) and defects related to the vehicle in gen-
eral are cited with relative rarity as accident
sources. Accident causes beyond the control
of the driver more frequently stem from other
factors (such as weather).

These facts demonstrate the urgency of
continuing efforts to enhance and extend the
scope of automotive safety technology (with
special emphasis on the associated electronic
systems). Improvements are needed to 
(cid:2) provide the driver with optimal support in

critical situations,

(cid:2) prevent accidents in the first place, and
(cid:2) reduce the severity of accidents when they

do occur.

The designer’s response to critical driving
conditions must thus be to foster “pre-
dictable” vehicle behavior during operation at
physical limits and in extreme situations. A
range of parameters (wheel speed, lateral ac-
celeration, yaw velocity, etc.) can be moni-
tored for processing in one or several elec-
tronic control units (ECUs). This capability
forms the basis of a concept for virtually
 immediate implementation of suitable re-
sponse strategies to enhance driver control of
critical processes.

The following situations and hazards pro-
vide examples of potential “limit conditions”:
(cid:2) changes in prevailing road and/or weather

conditions,

(cid:2) “conflicts of interest” with other road users,
(cid:2) animals and/or obstructions on the road,

(cid:2) a sudden defect (tire blow-out, etc.) on the

and

vehicle.

Critical traffic situations
The one salient factor that distinguishes criti-
cal traffic situations is abrupt change, such as
the sudden appearance of an unexpected ob-
stacle or a rapid change in road-surface condi-
tions. The problem is frequently compounded
by operator error. Owing to lack of experi-
ence, a driver who is travelling too fast or is
not concentrating on the road will not be able
to react with the judicious and rational re-
sponse that the circumstances demand.

Because drivers only rarely experience this
kind of critical situation, they usually fail to
recognize how close evasive action or a brak-
ing maneuver has brought them to the vehi-
cle’s physical limits. They do not grasp how
much of the potential adhesion between tires
and road surface has already been “used up”
and fail to perceive that the vehicle may be at
its maneuverability limit or about to skid off
the road. The driver is not prepared for this
and reacts either incorrectly or too precipi-
tously. The ultimate results are accidents and
scenaria that pose threats to other road users.

108

Motor-vehicle safety

Basics of vehicle operation

These factors are joined by still other potential
accident sources including outdated technol-
ogy and deficiencies in infrastructure (badly
designed roads, outdated traffic-guidance
concepts).

Terms such as “improvements in vehicle re-
sponse” and “support for the driver in critical
situations” are only meaningful if they refer to
mechanisms that produce genuine long-term
reductions in both the number and severity of
accidents. Lowering or removing the risk from
these critical situations entails executing diffi-
cult driving maneuvers including
(cid:2) rapid steering inputs including counter-

steering, 

(cid:2) lane changes during emergency braking,
(cid:2) maintaining precise tracking while negoti-
ating curves at high speeds and in the face
of changes in the road surface.

These kinds of maneuvers almost always pro-
voke a critical response from the vehicle, i.e.,
lack of tire traction prevents the vehicle react-
ing in the way that the driver would normally
expect; it deviates from the desired course.

Due to lack of experience in these borderline
situations, the driver is frequently unable to re-
gain active control of the vehicle, and often pan-
ics or overreacts. Evasive action serves as an ex-
ample. After applying excessive steering input in
the moment of initial panic, this driver then
countersteers with even greater zeal in an at-
tempt to compensate for his initial error. Ex-
tended sequences of steering and countersteer-
ing with progressively greater input angles then
lead to a loss of control over the vehicle, which
responds by breaking into a skid.

Driving behavior
A vehicle’s on-the-road handling and braking
response are defined by a variety of influ-
ences. These can be roughly divided into
three general categories:
(cid:2) vehicle characteristics,
(cid:2) the driver’s behavior patterns, ability and

reflexes, and

(cid:2) peripheral circumstances/or influences
from the surroundings or from outside.

A vehicle’s handling, braking and overall
 dynamic response are influenced by its struc-
ture and design.

Handling and braking responses define the
vehicle’s reactions to driver inputs (at steering
wheel, accelerator pedal, brakes, etc.) as do
external interference factors (road-surface
condition, wind, etc.).

Good handling is characterized by the ability
to precisely follow a given course and thus
comply in full with driver demand.
The driver’s responsibilities include:
(cid:2) adapting driving style to reflect traffic and

road conditions,

(cid:2) compliance with applicable traffic laws and

regulations,

(cid:2) following the optimal course as defined by
the road’s geometry as closely as possible,
and

(cid:2) guiding the vehicle with foresight and

 circumspection.

The driver pursues these objectives by
 continuously adapting the vehicle’s position
and motion to converge with a subjective
conception of an ideal status. The driver relies
upon personal experience to anticipate devel-
opments and adapt to instantaneous traffic
conditions.

(cid:2) stability,
(cid:2) steering response and brake performance,

and

(cid:2) handling at the limit. The tests are intended
to describe these factors as a basis for imple-
menting subsequent improvements.

The advantages of this procedure are:
(cid:2) it allows assessment of the overall, synergis-

tic system (“driver – vehicle – environ-
ment”) and

(cid:2) supports realistic simulation of numerous
situations encountered under everyday
traffic conditions.

The disadvantages of this procedure are:
(cid:2) the results extend through a broad scatter
range, as drivers, wind, road conditions
and initial status vary from one maneuver
to the next,

(cid:2) subjective impressions and experience 

are colored by the latitude for individual
interpretation, and

(cid:2) the success or failure of an entire test series
can ultimately be contingent upon the abil-
ities of a single driver.

Table 1 (next page) lists the essential vehicle
maneuvers for evaluating vehicle response
within a closed control loop.

Owing to the subjective nature of human
behavior, there are still no definitions of dy-
namic response in a closed control loop that
are both comprehensive and objectively
grounded (closed-loop operation, meaning
with driver, Fig. 2).

Despite this, the objective driving tests are
complimented by various test procedures ca-
pable of informing experienced drivers about
a vehicle’s handling stability (example: slalom
course).

Evaluating driver behavior
Subjective assessments made by experienced
drivers remain the prime element in evalua-
tions of vehicle response. Because assessments
based on subjective perceptions are only rela-
tive and not absolute, they cannot serve as the
basis for defining objective “truths”. As a re-
sult, subjective experience with one vehicle
can be applied to other vehicles only on a
comparative, relative basis.

Test drivers assess vehicle response using
selected maneuvers conceived to reflect “nor-
mal” traffic situations. The overall  system (in-
cluding the driver) is judged as a closed loop.
While the element “driver” cannot be pre-
cisely defined, this process provides a replace-
ment by inputting objective, specifically de-
fined interference factors into the system. The
resulting vehicular reaction is then analyzed
and evaluated. The following maneuvers are
either defined in existing ISO standards or
currently going through the standardization
process. These dry-surface exercises serve as
recognized procedures for assessing vehicular
stability:
(cid:2) steady-state skid-pad circulation,
(cid:2) transition response,
(cid:2) braking while cornering,
(cid:2) sensitivity to crosswinds,
(cid:2) Straight-running properties 
(tracking  stability), and 
(cid:2) load change on the skid pad.

In this process, prime factors such as road
geometry and assignments taken over by 
the driver assume vital significance. Each test
driver attempts to gather impressions and ex-
perience in the course of various prescribed
vehicle maneuvers; the subsequent analysis
process may well include comparisons of the
impressions registered by different drivers.
These often hazardous driving maneuvers
(e.g. the standard VDA evasive-action test,
also known as the “elk test”) are executed by a
series of drivers to generate data describing
the dynamic response and general handling
characteristics of the test vehicle. The criteria
include:

Transition response
Transition response joins steady-state self-
steering properties (during skid-pad circula-
tion) as a primary assessment parameter. 
This category embraces such maneuvers as
suddenly taking rapid evasive action when
driving straight ahead.

The “elk test” simulates an extreme sce-
nario featuring sudden evasive action to 
avoid an obstacle. A vehicle traveling over 
a 50 meter stretch of road must safely drive
around an obstacle 10 meters in length pro-
jecting outward onto the track by a distance
of 4 meters (Fig. 3).

Braking during cornering – 
load-change reactions
One of the most critical situations encoun-
tered in every-day driving – and thus one 
of the most vital considerations for vehicle
design – is braking during cornering.

From the standpoint of the physical forces
involved, whether the driver simply releases
the accelerator or actually depresses the brake
pedal is irrelevant; the physical effects will not
differ dramatically. The resulting load shift
from rear to front increasing the rear slip an-
gle while reducing that at the front, and since
neither the given cornering radius nor the 
vehicle speed modifies the lateral force 
requirement, the vehicle tends to adopt an
oversteering attitude.

With rear-wheel drive, tire slip exerts less
influence on the vehicle’s intrinsic handling
response than with front-wheel drive; this
means that RWD vehicles are more stable 
under these conditions.

Vehicle reaction during this maneuver
must represent the optimal compromise
 between steering response, stability and 
braking efficiency.

Driving maneuvers
Steady-state skid-pad circulation
Steady-state cornering around the skid pad 
is employed to determine maximum lateral
acceleration. This procedure also provides in-
formation on the transitions that dynamic
handling undergoes as cornering forces climb
to their maximum. This information can be
used to define the vehicle’s intrinsic handling
(self-steering) properties (oversteer, under-
steer, neutral cornering response).

Motor-vehicle safety

Basics of vehicle operation

Parameters
The primary parameters applied in the assess-
ment of dynamic handling response are:
(cid:2) steering-wheel angle,
(cid:2) lateral acceleration,
(cid:2) longitudinal acceleration or longitudinal

deceleration,
(cid:2) yaw velocity,
(cid:2) side-slip angle and roll angle.

Additional data allow more precise definition
of specific handling patterns as a basis for
evaluating other test results:
(cid:2) longitudinal and lateral velocity,
(cid:2) steering angles of front/rear wheels,
(cid:2) slip angle at all wheels,
(cid:2) steering-wheel force.

Reaction time
Within the overall system “driver-vehicle-
 environment”, the driver’s physical condition
and state of mind, and thus his/her reaction
times, join the parameters described above as
decisive factors. This lag period is the time
that elapses between perception of an obstacle
and initial application of pressure to the 
brake pedal. The decision to act and the foot
movement count as intermediate stages in 
this process. This period is not consistent; 
depending upon personal factors and external
circumstances it is at least 0.3 seconds.

Special examinations are required to 

quantify individual reaction patterns 
(as conducted by medical/psychological
 institutes).

Motion
Vehicle motion may be consistent in nature
(constant speed) or it may be inconsistent
(during acceleration from a standing or
rolling start, or deceleration and braking with
the accompanying change in velocity).

The engine generates the kinetic energy re-
quired to propel the vehicle. Forces stemming
either from external sources or acting
through the engine and drivetrain must
 always be applied to the vehicle as a basic
condition for changes in the magnitude 
and direction of its motion.

Handling and braking response 
in  commercial vehicles
Objective evaluation of handling and braking
response in heavy commercial vehicles is
based on various driving maneuvers includ-
ing steady-state skid-pad cornering, abrupt
steering-angle change (vehicle reaction to
“tugging” the steering wheel through a speci-
fied angle) and braking during cornering.
The dynamic lateral response of tractor
and trailer combinations generally differs
substantially from that of single vehicles. 
Particular emphasis is placed on tractor 
and trailer loading, while other important
factors include design configuration and the
geometry of the linkage elements within the
combination.

The worst-case scenario features an empty

truck pulling a loaded central-axle trailer.

 requires a high degree of skill and circum-
spection on the part of the driver.

Jack-knifing is also a danger when tractor-
trailer combinations are braked in extreme sit-
uations. This process is characterized by a loss
of lateral traction at the tractor’s rear axle and

is triggered when “overbraking” on slippery
road surfaces, or by extreme yaw rates on μ-
split surfaces (with different friction
 coefficients at the center and on the shoulder
of the lane). Jack-knifing can be avoided with
the aid of antilock braking systems (ABS).

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Tires

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Design
There are a number of different tire designs 
that are distinguished according to the nature
and sophistication of the technology em-
ployed. The design of a conventional tire is
determined by the characteristics required of
it in normal conditions and emergency situa-
tions. 

Legal requirements and regulations specify
which tires must be used in which conditions,
the maximum speeds at which different types
of tire may be used, and the criteria by which
tires are classified.

Radial tires
In a radial tire, the type which has now be-
come the standard for cars, the cords of the
tire-casing plies run radially, following the
shortest route from bead to bead (Fig. 1). 
A reinforcing belt runs around the perimeter
of the relatively thin, flexible casing. 

A body can only be made to move or change
course by the action of forces. Many forces
act upon a vehicle when it is being driven. An
important role is played by the tires as any
change of speed or direction involves forces
acting on the tires.

Tires

Task
The tire is the connecting link between the
vehicle and the road. It is at that point that
the safe handling of a vehicle is ultimately de-
cided. The tire transmits motive, braking and
lateral forces within a physical environment
whose parameters define the limits 
of the dynamic loads to which the vehicle 
is subjected. The decisive criteria for the
 assessment of tire quality are:
(cid:2) Straight-running ability
(cid:2) Stable cornering properties 
(cid:2) Ability to grip on a variety of road  surfaces
(cid:2) Ability to grip in a variety of weather

 conditions

(cid:2) Steering characteristics
(cid:2) Ride comfort (vibration absorption 

and damping, quietness)

(cid:2) Durability and
(cid:2) Economy

Cross-ply tires
The cross-ply tire takes its name from the fact
that the cords of alternate plies of the tire cas-
ing run at right angles to one another so that
they cross each other. This type of tire is now
only of significance for motorcycles, bicycles,
and industrial and agricultural vehicles. On
commercial vehicles it is increasingly being
supplanted by the radial tire.

Regulations
In Europe, the Council Directives, and in 
the USA the FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard) require that motor vehicles
and trailers are fitted with pneumatic tires
with a tread pattern consisting of grooves
with a depth of at least 1.6 mm around the
entire circumference of the tire and across the
full width of the tread.

Cars and motor vehicles with a permissible
laden weight of less than 2.8 tonnes and de-
signed for a maximum speed of more than 40
km/h, and trailers towed by them, must be fit-
ted either with cross-ply tires all round 
or with radial tires all round; in the case of
 vehicle-and-trailer combinations the require-
ment applies individually to each unit of the
combination. It does not apply to trailers
towed by vehicles at speeds of up to 25 km/h.

Application
To ensure correct use of tires, it is important
the correct tire is selected according to the
recommendations of the vehicle or tire man-
ufacturer. Fitting the same type of tire to all
wheels of a vehicle ensures the best handling
results. The specific instructions 
of the tire manufacturer or a tire specialist re-
garding tire care, maintenance, storage and
fitting should be followed in order to obtain
maximum durability and safety.

When the tires are in use, i.e. when they are
fitted to the wheel, care should be taken to
ensure that
(cid:2) the wheels are balanced so as to guarantee

optimum evenness of running,

(cid:2) all wheels are fitted with the same type of

tire and the tires are the correct size for the
vehicle,

(cid:2) the vehicle is not driven at speeds in  excess
of the maximum allowed for the tires fit-
ted, and

(cid:2) the tires have sufficient depth of tread.

The less tread there is on a tire, the thinner is
the layer of material protecting the belt and
the casing underneath it. And particularly on
cars and fast commercial vehicles, insufficient
tread depth on wet road surfaces has a deci-
sive effect on safe handling characteristics due
to the reduction in grip. Braking distance in-
creases disproportionately as tread depth re-
duces (Fig. 2). An especially critical handling
scenario is aquaplaning in which all adhesion
between tires and road surface is lost and the
vehicle is no longer steerable.

116

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Tires

Tire slip
Tire slip, or simply “slip”, is said to occur
when there is a difference between the theo-
retical and the actual distance traveled by a
vehicle. 

This can be illustrated by the following exam-
ple in which we will assume that the circum-
ference of a car tire is 2 meters. If the wheel ro-
tates ten times, the distance traveled should be
20 meters. If tire slip occurs, however, the dis-
tance actually traveled by the braked vehicle is
greater.

Causes of tire slip
When a wheel rotates under the effect of
power transmission or braking, complex
physical processes take place in the contact
area between tire and road which place the
rubber parts under stress and cause them 
to partially slide, even if the wheel does not
fully lock. In other words, the elasticity of the
tire causes it to deform and “flex” to a greater
or lesser extent depending on the weather
conditions and the nature of the road surface.
As the tire is made largely of rubber, only a
proportion of the “deformation energy” is re-
covered as the tread moves out of the contact
area. The tire heats up in the process and en-
ergy loss occurs.

Illustration of slip
The slip component of wheel rotation is
 referred to by λ, where

The quantity υF is the vehicle road speed, υU
is the circumferential velocity of the wheel
(Fig. 3). The formula states that brake slip oc-
curs as soon as the wheel is rotating more
slowly than the vehicle road speed would nor-
mally demand. Only under that condition can
braking forces or acceleration forces be trans-
mitted.

Since the tire slip is generated as a result 
of the vehicle’s longitudinal movement, 
it is also referred to as “longitudinal slip”. The
slip generated during braking is usually
termed “brake slip”.

If a tire is subjected to other factors in addi-
tion to slip (e.g. greater weight acting on the
wheels, extreme wheel positions), its force
transmission and handling characteristics will
be adversely affected.

Forces acting on a vehicle

Theory of inertia
Inertia is the property possessed by all bodies,
by virtue of which they will naturally main-
tain the status in which they find themselves,
i.e. either at rest or in motion. In order to
bring about a change to that status, 
a force has to be applied to the body. For
 example, if a car’s brakes are applied when 
it is cornering on black ice, the car will carry
on in a straight line without altering course
and without noticeably slowing down. That is
because on black ice, only very small tire
forces can be applied to the wheels.

Turning forces
Rotating bodies are influenced by turning
forces. The rotation of the wheels, for example,
is slowed down due to the braking torque and
accelerated due to the drive torque. 

Turning forces act on the entire vehicle. 
If the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on
a slippery surface (e. g. black ice) while the
wheels on the other side are on a road surface
with normal grip (e. g. asphalt), the vehicle
will slew around its vertical axis when the
brakes are applied (μ-split braking). This ro-
tation is caused by the yaw  moment, which
arises due to the different forces applied to
the sides of the vehicle.

Forces acting on a vehicle

Distribution of forces
In addition to the vehicle’s weight (resulting
from gravitational force), various different
types of force act upon it regardless of its
state of motion (Fig. 1). Some of these are 
(cid:2) forces which act along the longitudinal axis

of the vehicle (e. g. motive force,
 aerodynamic drag or rolling friction); oth-
ers are 

(cid:2) forces which act laterally on the vehicle

(e. g. steering force, centrifugal force when
cornering or crosswinds). The tire forces
which act laterally on the vehicle are also
referred to as lateral forces.

The longitudinal and the lateral forces are
transmitted either “downwards” or “sideways”
to the tires and ultimately to the road. The
forces are transferred through
(cid:2) the chassis (e. g. wind),
(cid:2) the steering (steering force),
(cid:2) the engine and transmission (motive

force), or

(cid:2) the braking system (braking force).

Opposing forces act “upwards” from the road
onto the tires and thence to the vehicle be-
cause every force produces an opposing force.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

Basically, in order for the vehicle to move, the
motive force of the engine (engine torque)
must overcome all forces that resist motion
(all longitudinal and lateral forces) such as are
generated by road gradient or camber.

In order to assess the dynamic handling
characteristics or handling stability of a vehi-
cle, the forces acting between the tires and the
road, i.e. the forces transmitted in the contact
areas between tire and road surface (also re-
ferred to as “tire contact area” or “footprint”),
must be known.

With more practice and experience, a driver
generally learns to react more effectively to
those forces. They are evident to the driver
when accelerating or slowing down as well as
in cross winds or on slippery road surfaces. If
the forces are particularly strong, i.e. if they
produce exaggerated changes in the motion
of the vehicle, they can also be dangerous
(skidding) or at least are detectable by squeal-
ing tires (e.g. when accelerating aggressively)
and increased component wear.

2

Components of tire force and pressure distribution
over the footprint of a radial tire

Tire forces
A motor vehicle can only be made to move or
change its direction in a specific way by forces
acting through the tires. Those forces are
made up of the following components (Fig.
2):

Circumferential force
The circumferential force FU is produced by
power transmission or braking. It acts on the
road surface as a linear force in line with the
longitudinal axis of the vehicle and enables
the driver to increase the speed of the vehicle
using the accelerator or slow it down with the
brakes.

Vertical tire force (normal force)
The vertical force acting downwards between
the tire and road surface is called the vertical
tire force or normal force FN. It acts on the
tires at all times regardless of the state of mo-
tion of the vehicle, including, therefore, when
the vehicle is stationary. 

The vertical force is determined by the pro-

portion of the combined weight of vehicle
and payload that is acting on the individual
wheel concerned. It also depends on the de-
gree of upward or downward gradient 
of the road that the vehicle is standing on.
The highest levels of vertical force occur on a
level road.

Other forces acting on the vehicle (e.g.
heavier payload) can increase or decrease the
vertical force. When cornering, the force is re-
duced on the inner wheels and increased on
the outer wheels.

The vertical tire force deforms the part of the
tire in contact with the road. As the tire side-
walls are affected by that deformation, the
vertical force cannot be evenly distributed. A
trapezoidal pressure-distribution pattern is
produced (Fig. 2). The tire sidewalls absorb
the forces and the tire deforms according to
the load applied to it.

Forces acting on a vehicle

119

Lateral force
Lateral forces act upon the wheels when steer-
ing or when there is a crosswind, for  example.
They cause the vehicle to change direction. 

Braking torque
When the brakes are applied, the brake shoes
press against the brake drums (in the case of
drum brakes) or the brake pads press against
the disks (in the case of disk brakes). This
generates frictional forces, the level of which
can be controlled by the driver by the pres-
sure applied to the brake pedal. 

The product of the frictional forces and the
distance at which they act from the axis of ro-
tation of the wheel is the braking torque MB.
That torque is effective at the circumfer-

ence of the tire under braking (Fig. 1).

Yaw moment
The yaw moment around the vehicle’s vertical
axis is caused by different longitudinal forces
acting on the left and right-hand sides of the
vehicle or different lateral forces acting at the
front and rear axles. Yaw moments are re-
quired to turn the vehicle when cornering.
Undesired yaw moments, such as can occur
when braking on μ-split (see above) or if the
vehicle pulls to one side when braking, can be
reduced using suitable design measures. The
kingpin offset is the distance between the
point of contact between the tire and the road
and the point at which 
the wheel’s steering axis intersects the road
surface (Fig. 3). It is negative if the point at
which the steering axis intersects the road
surface is on the outside of the point of con-
tact between tire and road. Braking forces
combine with positive and negative kingpin
offset to create a lever effect that produces a
turning force at the steering which can lead to
a certain steering angle at the wheel. If the
kingpin offset is negative, this steering angle
counters the undesired yaw moment.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Forces acting on a vehicle

Friction force
Coefficient of friction
When braking torque is applied to a wheel, 
a braking force FB is generated between the
tire and the road surface that is proportional
to the braking torque under stationary condi-
tions (no wheel acceleration). The braking
force transmitted to the road (frictional force
FR) is proportional to the vertical tire force
FN:

FR = μHF · FN

The factor μHF is the coefficient of friction. 
It defines the frictional properties of the vari-
ous possible material pairings between tire
and road surface and the environmental con-
ditions to which they are exposed. 

The coefficient of friction is thus a measure

of the braking force that can be transmitted.
It is dependent on
(cid:2) the nature of the road surface,
(cid:2) the condition of the tires,
(cid:2) the vehicle’s road speed, and
(cid:2) the weather conditions.

The coefficient of friction ultimately deter-
mines the degree to which the braking torque
is actually effective. For motor-vehicle tires,
the coefficient of friction is at its highest on a

clean and dry road surface; it is at its lowest
on ice. Fluids (e.g. water) or dirt between the
tire and the road surface reduce the coeffi-
cient of friction. The figures quoted in Table 1
apply to concrete and tarmacadam road sur-
faces in good condition.

On wet road surfaces in particular, the
 coefficient of friction is heavily dependent on
vehicle road speed. At high speeds on less
than ideal road surfaces, the wheels may lock
up under braking because the coefficient of
friction is not high enough to provide suffi-
cient adhesion for the tires to grip the road
surface. Once a wheel locks up, it can no
longer transmit side forces and the vehicle 
is thus no longer steerable. Fig. 5 illustrates
the frequency distribution of the coefficient
of friction at a locked wheel at various road
speeds on wet roads. 

The friction or adhesion between the tire and
the road surface determines the wheel’s abil-
ity to transmit force. The ABS (Antilock
Braking System) and TCS (Traction Control
System) safety systems utilize the available
adhesion to its maximum potential.

Effect of brake slip on coefficient of friction
When a vehicle is pulling away or accelerating
– just as when braking or decelerating – the
transmission of forces from tire to road de-
pends on the degree of adhesion between the
two. The friction of a tire basically has 
a constant relationship to the level of adhe-
sion under braking or acceleration.

Fig. 6 shows the progression of the coeffi-
cient of friction μHF under braking. Starting
from a zero degree of brake slip, is rises
steeply to its maximum at between 10% 
and 40% brake slip, depending on the nature
of the road surface and the tires, and then
drops away again. The rising slope of the

Aquaplaning
The amount of friction approaches zero if
rainwater forms a film on the road surface on
which the vehicle then “floats”. Contact be-
tween the tires and the road surface is then
lost and the effect known as aquaplaning oc-
curs. Aquaplaning is caused by a “wedge” of
water being forced under the  entire contact
area of the tire with the road surface, thereby
lifting it off the ground. Aquaplaning is de-
pendent on:
(cid:2) the depth of water on the road,
(cid:2) the speed of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the tire tread pattern, tire width and level

(cid:2) the force pressing the tire against the road

of wear, and

surface.

Wide tires are particularly susceptible to
aquaplaning. When a vehicle is aquaplaning,
it cannot be steered or braked. Neither steer-
ing movements nor braking forces can be
transmitted to the road.

Kinetic friction
When describing processes involving friction,
a distinction is made between static friction
and kinetic friction. With solid bodies, the
static friction is greater than kinetic friction.
Accordingly, for a rolling rubber tire there are
circumstances in which the coefficient of fric-
tion is greater than when the wheel locks.
Nevertheless, the tire can also slide while it is
rolling, and on motor vehicles this is referred
to as slip.

curve represents the “stable zone” (partial-
braking zone), while the falling slope is the
“unstable zone”.

Most braking operations involve minimal lev-
els of slip and take place within the stable
zone so that an increase in the degree of slip
simultaneously produces an increase in the
usable adhesion. In the unstable zone, an
 increase in the amount of slip generally pro-
duces a reduction in the level of adhesion.
When braking in such situations, the wheel
can lock up within a fraction of a second, and
under acceleration the excess power-trans-
mission torque rapidly increases the wheel’s
speed of rotation causing it to spin.

When a vehicle is traveling in a straight line,
ABS and TCS prevent it entering the unstable
zone when braking or accelerating. 

Sideways forces
If a lateral force acts on a rolling wheel, the
center of the wheel moves sideways. The  ratio
between the lateral velocity and the velocity
along the longitudinal axis is referred to as
“lateral slip”. The angle between the resulting
velocity, υα, and the forward velocity, υx, is
called the “lateral slip angle α” (Fig. 7). The
side-slip angle, γ, is the angle between the ve-
hicle’s direction of travel and its longitudinal
axis. The side-slip angle encountered at high
rates of lateral acceleration is regarded as an
index of controllability, in other words the
 vehicle’s response to driver input.

Under steady-state conditions (when the
wheel is not being accelerated), the lateral
force FS acting on the center of the wheel is in
equilibrium with the lateral force applied to
the wheel by the road surface. The relation-
ship between the lateral force acting through
the center of the wheel and the wheel contact
force FN is called the “lateral-force coefficient
μS”.

123

There is a nonlinear relationship between 
the slip angle α and the lateral-force coeffi-
cient μS that can be described by a lateral 
slip curve. In contrast with the coefficient 
of friction μHF that occurs under acceleration
and braking, the lateral-force coefficient μS is
heavily dependent on the wheel contact force
FN. This characteristic is of particular interest
to vehicle manufacturers when designing sus-
pension systems so that handling characteris-
tics can be enhanced by stabilizers. 

Fig. 6 shows the lateral-force coefficient, μS,
as a function of brake slip at a lateral slip an-
gle of 4°. The lateral-force coefficient is at its
highest when the brake slip is zero. As brake
slip increases, the lateral-force coefficient de-
clines gradually at first and then increasingly
rapidly until it reaches its lowest point when
the wheel locks up. That minimum figure oc-
curs as a result of the lateral slip angle
 position of the locked wheel, which at that
point provides no lateral force whatsoever.

With a strong lateral force, FS, the tire contact
area (footprint) shifts significantly relative to
the wheel (Fig. 8). This retards the buildup 
of the lateral force. This phenomenon greatly
affects the transitional response (behavior dur-
ing transition from one dynamic state 
to another) of vehicles under steering.

Effect of brake slip on lateral forces
When a vehicle is cornering, the centrifugal
force acting outwards at the center of gravity
must be held in equilibrium by lateral forces
on all the wheels in order for the vehicle to be
able to follow the curve of the road. 

However, lateral forces can only be gener-

ated if the tires deform flexibly sideways 
so that the direction of movement of the
wheel’s center of gravity at the velocity, υα, di-
verges from the wheel center plane “m” 
by the lateral slip angle, α (Fig. 7).

Friction – tire slip – vertical tire force
The friction of a tire depends largely on the
degree of slip. The vertical tire force plays a
subordinate role, there being a roughly linear
relationship between braking force and verti-
cal tire force at a constant level of slip.

The friction, however, is also dependent on
the tire’s lateral slip angle. Thus the braking
and motive force reduces as the lateral slide
angle is increased at a constant level of tire
slip. Conversely, if the braking and motive
force remains constant while the lateral slip
angle is increased, the degree of tire slip
 increases.

124

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Dynamics of linear motion

Dynamics of linear motion

If the rim of a wheel is subjected both to a lat-
eral force and braking torque, the road surface
reacts to this by exerting a lateral force and a
braking force on the tire. Accordingly, up to a
specific limit determined by physical parame-
ters, all forces acting on the rotating wheel are
counterbalanced by equal and opposite forces
from the road surface. 

Beyond that limit, however, the forces are

no longer in equilibrium and the vehicle’s
handling becomes unstable.

versely mounted engines), the greater is the
motive force available at the driven wheels. 
A proportion of the motive force is re-
quired to overcome the total resistance to
motion. It is adapted to suit the substantial
increase in motion resistance on uphill gradi-
ents by the use of a choice of lower gearing
ratios (multi-speed transmission). If there 
is a “surplus” of power because the motive
force is greater than the resistance to motion,
the vehicle will accelerate. If the overall resis-
tance to motion is greater, the vehicle will de-
celerate. 

Total resistance to motion
The total resistance to vehicle motion, FG, 
is the sum of the rolling resistance, aerody-
namic drag and climbing resistance (Fig. 1).
In order to overcome that total resistance, 
a sufficient amount of motive force has to 
be applied to the driven wheels. The greater
the engine torque, the higher the transmis-
sion ratio between the engine and the driven
wheels and the smaller the power loss
through the drivetrain (efficiency η is  approx.
0.88...0.92 with engines mounted 
in line, and approx. 0.91...0.95 with trans-

Rolling resistance when traveling 
in a straight line 
Rolling resistance is produced by deformation
processes which occur where the tire is in
contact with the road. It is the product of
weight and rolling resistance coefficient and
increases with a smaller wheel diameter and
the greater the degree of deformation of the
tire, e.g. if the tire is under-inflated. However,
it also increases as the weight on the wheel
and the velocity increases. Furthermore, it
varies according to type of road  surface – on
asphalt, for example, it is only around 25% of
what it is on a dirt track.

Rolling resistance when cornering 
When cornering, the rolling resistance is
increased by an extra component, cornering
resistance, the coefficient of which is depen-
dent on vehicle speed, the radius of the bend
being negotiated, suspension characteristics,
type of tires, tire pressure and lateral-slip
characteristics.

Aerodynamic drag
The aerodynamic drag FL is calculated from
the air density ρ, the drag coefficient cW
(dependent on the vehicle body shape, Tables
1 and 2), vehicle’s frontal cross-sectional area
A and the driving speed υ (taking account of
the headwind speed).

FL = cW · A · υ2 · ρ/2

Climbing resistance
Climbing resistance, FSt (if positive), or gravi-
tational pull (if negative) is the product of the
weight of the vehicle, G, and the angle of up-
hill or downhill gradient, α.

FSt = G · sin α

Acceleration and deceleration
Steady acceleration or deceleration in a
straight line occurs when the rate of accelera-
tion (or deceleration) is constant. The dis-
tance required for deceleration is of greater
significance than that required for accelera-
tion because braking distance has direct
implications in terms of vehicle and road
safety.

The braking distance is dependent on a num-
ber of factors including
(cid:2) Vehicle speed: at a constant rate of deceler-
ation, braking distance increases quadrati-
cally relative to speed.

(cid:2) Vehicle load: extra weight makes braking

distances longer.

(cid:2) Road conditions: wet roads offer less

adhesion between road surface and tires
and therefore result in longer braking
distances.

(cid:2) Tire condition: insufficient tread depth in-
creases braking distances, particularly on
wet road surfaces.

(cid:2) Condition of brakes: oil on the brake pads/
shoes, for example, reduces the friction be-
tween the pads/shoes and the disk/drum.
The lower braking force thus available
results in longer braking distances.

(cid:2) Fading: The braking power also diminishes
due to the brake components overheating.

The greatest rates of acceleration or decelera-
tion are reached at the point when the motive
or braking force is at the highest level possible
without the tires starting to lose grip (maxi-
mum traction).

The rates actually achievable under real
conditions, however, are always slightly lower
because the vehicle’s wheels are not 
all at the point of maximum adhesion at pre-
cisely the same moment. Electronic traction,
braking and vehicle-handling control systems
(TCS, ABS and ESP) are active around the
point of maximum force transmission.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Dynamics of lateral motion

Dynamics of lateral motion

Response to crosswinds 
Strong crosswinds can move a vehicle off
course, especially if it is traveling at a high
speed and its shape and dimensions present a
large surface area for the wind to catch (Fig.
1). Sudden crosswind gusts such as may be
encountered when exiting a road cutting can
cause substantial sideways movement (yaw)
of high-sided vehicles. This happens too
quickly for the driver 
to react and may provoke incorrect driver re-
sponse.

When a vehicle is driving through a cross-
wind, the wind force, FW, produces a lateral
component in addition to the longitudinal
aerodynamic drag, FL. Although its effect is
distributed across the entire body surface,
it may be thought of as a single force, the lat-
eral wind force, FSW, acting at a single point
of action “D”. The actual location of the point
of action is determined by the vehicle’s body
shape and angle of incidence α of the wind.

The point of action is generally in the 
front half of the vehicle. On conventionally
shaped saloon cars (“three-box” design) it 
is largely static and is closer to the center 
of the vehicle than on vehicles with a more
streamlined body shape (sloping back), where
it can move according to the angle 
of incidence of the wind.

The position of the center of gravity, S, on
the other hand depends on the size and dis-
tribution of the vehicle load. In view of these
variable factors, therefore, in order to arrive
at a general representation of the effect of a
crosswind (that is not affected by the relative
position of the wheels and suspension to the
body), a reference point 0 on the center line
of the vehicle at the front is adopted.

When specifying lateral wind force at a refer-
ence point other than the true point of
action, the turning force of the crosswind
around the point of action, that is the yaw
moment, MZ, must also be considered. The
crosswind force is resisted by the lateral cor-
nering forces at the wheels. The degree of lat-
eral cornering force which a pneumatic tire
can provide depends on various factors in ad-
dition to lateral slip angle and wheel load,
such as tire design and size, tire pressure and
the amount of grip afforded by 
the road surface.

A vehicle will have good directional stability
characteristics in a crosswind if the point of
action is close to the vehicle’s center of grav-
ity. Vehicles that tend to oversteer will deviate
less from their course in a crosswind if the
point of action is forward of the center of
gravity. The best position for the point of ac-
tion on vehicles with a tendency to understeer
is slightly behind the center of gravity.

Understeer and oversteer
Cornering forces between a rubber-tired
wheel and the road can only be generated
when the wheel is rotating at an angle to its
plane. A lateral slip angle must therefore be
present. A vehicle is said to understeer when,
as lateral acceleration increases, the lateral slip
angle at the front axle increases more than it
does at the rear axle. The opposite is true of a
vehicle which oversteers (Fig. 2).

For safety reasons, vehicles are designed to

slightly understeer. As a result of drive slip,
however, a front-wheel drive vehicle can
quickly change to sharply understeer or 
a rear-wheel drive vehicle to oversteer.

Centrifugal force while cornering 
Centrifugal force, Fcf, acts at the center 
of gravity, S, (Fig. 3). Its effect depends 
on a number of factors such as
(cid:2) the radius of the bend,
(cid:2) the speed of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the height of the vehicle’s center of gravity,
(cid:2) the mass of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the track of the vehicle,
(cid:2) the frictional characteristics of the tire and

road surface (tire condition, type 
of surface, weather conditions), and 
(cid:2) the load distribution in the vehicle.

Potentially hazardous situations will occur
when cornering if the centrifugal force
reaches a point where it threatens to over-
come the lateral forces at the wheels and 
the vehicle cannot be held on its intended
course. This effect can be partially counter-
acted by positive camber or banked corners.

If the vehicle slips at the front wheel, it un-
dersteers; if it slips at the wheel axle, it over-
steers. In both cases the Electronic Stability
Program (ESP) detects an undesirable rota-
tion about the vertical axle. By active inter-
vention in the form of selective braking of in-
dividual wheels, it is then able to correct the
imbalance.

Braking sequence
As defined in ISO 611, the term “braking
sequence” refers to all operations that take
place between the point at which operation of
the (brake) actuation device begins and the
point at which braking ends (when the brake
is released or the vehicle is at a standstill).

Variable braking 
A type of braking system which allows the
driver at any time to increase or reduce the
braking force to a sufficiently precise degree
by operating the actuation device within its
normal effective range.

If operating the actuation device in a par-

ticular manner increases the braking force,
then the opposite action must reverse the ef-
fect and reduce the braking force.

Braking-system hysteresis
Braking system hysteresis is the difference be-
tween the actuating forces when the brake is
applied and released at a constant braking
torque.

Brake hysteresis 
Brake hysteresis is the difference between the
application forces when the brake is actuated
and released at a constant braking torque.

Forces and torques 
Actuating force
The actuating force, FC, is the force that is
applied to the actuation device.

Application force
On a friction brake, the application force is
the total force exerted on the brake-pad
mount, together with attached friction mater-
ial, in order to generate the friction required
for the braking force.

Total braking force
The total braking force, Ff, is the sum total of
braking forces at each of the wheels that are
produced by the effect of the braking system
and which oppose the vehicle’s motion or its
tendency to move.

Braking torque
The braking torque is the product of the fric-
tional forces generated in the brake by the ap-
plication forces and the distance of the point of
action of those forces from the axis of rota-
tion of the wheel.

Braking-force distribution
The braking-force distribution indicates in
terms of percentage share how the total brak-
ing force, Ff, is distributed between the front
and rear wheels, e.g. front wheels 60%, rear
wheels 40%.

External brake coefficient, C
The external brake coefficient, C, is the ratio of
the output torque to the input torque or the
output force to the input force of a brake.

Internal brake coefficient, C*
The internal brake coefficient, C*, is the ratio
of the total tangential force acting at the effec-
tive radius of a brake to the application force,
FS.

Typical values: for drum brakes, values of
up to C* = 10 may be obtained, for disc brakes
C* ≈ 1.

Time periods 
The braking sequence is characterised by a
number of time periods which are defined
with reference to the ideal curves shown in
Figure 1.

Period of movement of actuation device 
The period of movement of the actuation de-
vice is the time from the point at which force
is first applied to the actuation device (t0), to
the point at which it reaches its final position
(t3) as determined by the actuating force or
the actuation travel. The same applies by anal-
ogy to the release of the brakes.

Basic principles of vehicle dynamics

Definitions

129

Response time
The response time, ta, is the time that elapses
from the point at which force is first applied
to the actuation device to the point at which
braking force is first produced (pressure gen-
erated in the brake lines) (t1 – t0).

Pressure build-up time
The pressure build-up time, ts, is the time from
the point at which braking force is first pro-
duced to the point at which the pressure in
the brake lines reaches its highest level (t5 – t1).

Total braking time
The braking time, tb, is the time that elapses
from the point at which force is first applied
to the actuation device to the point at which
braking force ceases (t7 – t0). If the vehicle
comes to a halt, then the moment at which
the vehicle is first stationary is the moment at
which the braking time ends.

Effective braking time
The effective braking time, tw, is the time that
elapses from the moment at which braking
force is first produced to the moment at
which braking force ceases (t7 – t2). If the ve-
hicle comes to a halt, then the moment at
which the vehicle is first stationary is the mo-
ment at which the effective braking time
ends.

Distances
Braking distance
The braking distance, s1, is the distance trav-
elled by a vehicle during the period of the 
effective braking time (t7 – t2).

Total braking distance
The total braking distance s0 is the distance
travelled by a vehicle during the period of the
total braking time (t7 – t0). That is the dis-
tance travelled from the point at which the
driver first applies force to the actuation de-
vice to the point at which the vehicle is at a
standstill.

Braking deceleration
Momentary deceleration 
The momentary deceleration, a, is the quotient
of the reduction in speed and the elapsed time.
a = dυ/dt

Average deceleration over the total braking
distance
From the vehicle speed υ0 at the time t0, the
average deceleration, ams, over the stopping
distance, s0, is calculated using the formula
ams = υ0

2/2s0

Mean fully developed deceleration
The figure for mean fully developed decelera-
tion, amft, represents the average deceleration
during the period in which deceleration is at
its fully developed level (t7 – t6).

Braking factor
The braking factor, Z, is the ratio between to-
tal braking force, Ff, and total static weight,
GS, (vehicle weight) acting on the axle or axles
of the vehicle. That is equivalent to the ratio
of braking deceleration, a, to gravitational ac-
celeration, g (g = 9.81 m/s2).

Car braking systems

Overview

Car braking systems

Braking systems are indispensable for the
roadworthiness and safe operation of a
 motor vehicle in road traffic conditions.
They are therefore subject to strict legal
 requirements. The increasing effectiveness
and sophistication demanded of braking 
systems over the course of time has meant
that the mechanical systems have been
 continually improved. With the advent of
microelectronics, the braking system has 
become a complex electronic system.

Overview

Car braking systems must perform the 
following fundamental tasks:
(cid:2) Reduce the speed of the vehicle
(cid:2) Bring the vehicle to a halt
(cid:2) Prevent unwanted acceleration during

downhill driving

(cid:2) Keep the vehicle stationary when it is

stopped

The first three of those tasks are performed
by the service brakes. The driver controls the
service brakes by operating the brake pedal.
The parking brake (“hand brake”) keeps the
vehicle stationary once it is at a standstill.

Conventional braking systems
On conventional braking systems, the braking
sequence is initiated exclusively by means of
force applied to the brake pedal. In the braking
system’s master cylinder, that force is converted
into hydraulic pressure. Brake fluid acts as the
transmission medium between the master
cylinder and the brakes (Figure 1). 

On power-assisted braking systems such as
are most frequently used on cars and light
commercial vehicles, the actuation pressure 
is amplified by a brake servo unit (brake
booster).

Electronic vehicle-dynamics systems
Continuing development of the ABS system
led to the creation of TCS (Traction Control
System). This system, which was first seen on
volume-production cars in 1987, prevents
wheel spin under acceleration and thus im-
proves vehicle handling. Consequently, it is
not a braking system in the strict sense of the
word. Nevertheless, it makes use of and ac-
tively operates the braking system to prevent
a wheel from spinning.

Another vehicle-dynamics system is the 
ESP (Electronic Stability Program), which
prevents the vehicle entering a skid within
physically determined parameters. It too
makes use of and actively controls the brak-
ing system in order to stabilise the vehicle.

Ancillary functions of electronic systems
Electronic processing of data also makes pos-
sible a number of ancillary functions that can
be integrated in the overall electronic braking
and vehicle-dynamics systems.
(cid:2) Brake Assistant (BA) increases brake pres-
sure if the driver is hesitant in applying the
full force of the brakes in an emergency.
(cid:2) Electronic Braking-force distribution con-
trols the braking force at the rear wheels so
that the best possible balance between front
and rear wheel braking is achieved.

(cid:2) Hill Descent Control (HDC) automatically

brakes the vehicle on steep descents.

Electronic braking systems
Antilock braking system (ABS)
An electronic braking system was first used
on a volume-production vehicle in 1978. ABS
(Antilock Braking System) prevents the
wheels locking up and the vehicle becoming
uncontrollable under heavy braking. 

As with conventional systems, an ABS system
has a mechanical link between the brake pedal
and the brakes. But it also incorporates an ad-
ditional component, the hydraulic modulator.
Solenoid valves in the hydraulic modulator
are controlled in such a way that if the degree
of wheel slip exceeds a certain amount, the
brake pressure in the individual wheel cylin-
ders is selectively limited to prevent the
wheels locking.

ABS has been continually improved and de-
veloped to the extent that it is now standard
equipment on virtually all new vehicles sold
in western Europe.

Electrohydraulic brakes (SBC)
SBC (Sensotronic Brake Control) represents a
new generation of braking systems. Under
normal operating conditions, it has no me-
chanical link between the brake pedal and the
wheel cylinders. The SBC electrohydraulic sys-
tem detects the brake pedal travel electronically
using duplicated sensor systems and analyses
the sensor signals in an ECU. This method of op-
eration is sometimes referred to as“brake by
wire”. The hydraulic modulator controls the
pressure in the individual brakes by means of
solenoid valves. Operation of the brakes is
still effected hydraulically using brake fluid as
the transmission medium.

Electromechanical brakes (EMB)
In the future there will be another electronic
braking system, EMB (Electromechanical
Brakes), which will operate electromechani-
cally rather than employing hydraulics.  Elec -
tric motors will force the brake pads against
the discs in order to provide the braking
 action. The link between the brake pedal and
the brakes will be purely electronic.

History of the brake

History of the brake

Origin and development
The first use of the wheel is dated to
5,000 B.C. Usually, cattle were used as draft
animals; later, horses and donkeys were also
used. The invention of the wheel made it
necessary to invent the brake. After all, a
horse-drawn carriage traveling downhill had
to be slowed down, not only to keep its
speed within controllable limits, but also to
prevent it running into the back of the
horses. This was likely done using wooden
rods braced against the ground or the wheel
disks. Beginning around 700 B.C., wheels ac-
quired iron tires to prevent premature wear
of the wheel rim. 

Beginning in 1690, coach drivers used a
“chock” to brake their carriages. While
 driving downhill, they used its handle push

1

it under a wheel, which then was immobi-
lized and slid onto the chock.

In 1817, at the dawn of the industrial age,

Baron Karl Drais rode from Karlsruhe in
southern Germany to Kehl, proving to a
stunned public that it is possible to ride on
two wheels without falling over. As he surely
had difficulty stopping when driving down-
hill, his last, 1820 model featured a friction
brake on the rear wheel (Fig. 1).

Finally, in 1850, the iron axle was intro-
duced in carriage construction, along with
the shoe brake. In this type of brake, brake
shoes were pressed against the metallic run-
ning surface of the iron-coated wooden
wheels. The shoe brake could be operated
from the driver’s seat with the aid of a crank
handle and a gear linkage (Fig. 2).

The low speed and sluggish drive train of
the first automobiles did not place any great
demands on the effectiveness of the brakes.
In the early days, the shoe, band and wedge
brakes, which were manually or foot-oper-
ated using levers, hinges and cables on the
fixed rear axles, were sufficient for this
 purpose. 

At first, the rear wheels were braked; occa-
sionally, an intermediate shaft or only the
cardan shaft was braked. Only about 35 years
after the automobile was invented were the
front wheels equipped with (cable-operated)
brakes. Even more years passed before
 automobiles began to be equipped with
 hydraulically operated brakes, which, at the
time, were only drum brakes. Use of the old
method of cable activation continued in a
few models, such as the VW Beetle, until
 after World War II. Other important mile-
stones were the use of disk brakes and, in the
present era, the introduction and incremen-
tal development of various driving stability
systems.

History of the brake

133

Shoe and external shoe brakes on the
wheel running surfaces
The first motor vehicles drove on wooden
wheels with steel or rubber tires, or rubber-
tired, spoked steel wheels. For braking, levers
(as for the horse-drawn carriages) pushed
brake shoes or external shoe brakes with
friction linings against the running surfaces
of the rear wheels. An initial example is the
“riding carriage” developed by Gottlieb
Daimler as an experimental vehicle in 1885
(the first motorcycle, with an engine perfor-
mance of 0.5 horsepower and a top speed of
12 km/h). A cable led from the brake actuat-

ing lever, located at the front, close to the
steering arm, to the external shoe brake on
the rear wheel (Figures 3a, b).

In 1886, the first passenger cars with internal
combustion engines were introduced: the
Daimler motor carriage (1.1 hp, 16 km/h),
which was derived from the horse carriage,
and the Benz motorcar, which was newly de-
signed as an automobile. Both of them had
shoe brakes, as did the world’s first truck,
built in 1896. The shoe brake was installed
in front of the rear wheels of each vehicle
(Figures 3c, d, e, f.).

Band and external shoe brakes
As solid rubber tires quickly became estab-
lished for motor vehicles (beginning with
the triangular Benz motorcar in 1886 and
the Daimler steel-wheeled car of 1889) and
were soon replaced by air-filled rubber tires
for a more comfortable ride, the era of the
shoe brake in automobiles had already come
to an end. 

From then on, band brakes (flexible steel
brake bands that braked either directly or
via several brake shoes riveted to the inside)
or external shoe brakes (rigid cast iron or
steel brake shoes with brake linings) began
to be used. These pedal-operated brakes
worked with external brake drums that were
normally installed at the front on the inter-
mediate drive shaft or on the drive axle in
the rear wheel area. 

For example, the Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach
produced the first Wartburg motorcar in
1898. Model 1 featured an exposed trans-
mission and drive pinions. Band brakes
braked both the axle drive and the two rear
wheels.

In 1899, the Daimler steel-wheeled car had
solid rubber tires and steel band brakes on
the rear wheels (Fig. 4). The Daimler
“Phoenix”, also dating from 1899, still had
solid rubber tires, but these were soon re-
placed by air-filled tires. A footbrake acted as
an external shoe brake on the front drive
shaft (Figures 5 and 6), and the handbrake
acted on the rear wheels. In addition, this
car featured – as did, for example, the Benz
racing car of 1899 (Fig. 7) – a “sprag brake”,
a strong rod mounted on the rear that had
the purpose of being driven into the (usually
relatively soft) road.

 depressing the left foot pedal, which acts as a
band brake on the brake disks fastened to
the two rear wheels. Simultaneously, as
 mentioned above, the belt is automatically
moved out. To stop the car immediately,
both the left and the right pedals are de-
pressed at the same time, which causes the
band brake connected to the right pedal to
act on the brake disk and thus brake the
 reduction gear.”

Internal shoe drum brakes with 
mechanical cable activation
Over time, vehicles became faster and heav-
ier. Therefore, they required a more effective
brake system. Thus band and external shoe
brakes soon gave way to the internal shoe
drum brake, for which Louis Renault ap-
plied for a patent in 1902. A spreading
mechanism pushed two crescent-shaped
brake shoes against the inner surface of the
cast iron or steel brake drums, which were
connected to the wheel. Due to its self-rein-
forcing effect, the drum brake features low
operating forces compared to the braking
forces, long maintenance periods and long-
lasting linings.

At first, the braking force was transmitted to
the two drum brakes of the rear wheels
 using brake cables.

For example, the Mercedes Simplex already
featured additional, cable-operated rear
wheel drum brakes (Fig. 8) in addition to the
cardan shaft band brake. Due to higher en-
gine performance (40 horsepower), a second
footbrake (Fig. 9) was added, which also
acted as a band brake on the intermediate
shaft of the chain drive. By the way, all four
brakes were cooled by a water spray which,
during braking, dripped onto the friction
surfaces from a reservoir.

Beginning in about 1920, vehicles were fitted
with drum brakes on all four wheels. The
braking force was still transmitted using
 mechanical means, i.e. levers, joints and
brake cables.

136

Car braking systems

History of the brake

These cable-operated drum brakes remained
in use for a long time. One example was
the standard VW model of the 1950s
(Fig. 10): 

The primary element of this brake system
was a brake pressure rail (Item 1). The four
brake cables (2) attached to this element ran
backwards through cable sleeves to the
wheel brakes (drum brakes) of the four
wheels (3). The rear part of the rail was sup-
ported by a short lever that sat on the brake
pedal shaft. When the brake pedal of the
footbrake (4) was depressed, the brake pres-
sure rail was pushed forwards along with the
four cables. The cables transmitted the force
to the wheel brakes. 

The lever for the handbrake (5) was fur-
ther back in the car. However, via a decou-
pled rod, the handbrake ultimately acted on
the same mechanism as the footbrake, and
thus likewise acted on all four wheels.

Hydraulic brake activation
The main problem of the cable brake was
the great maintenance effort and the uneven
braking effect caused by uneven friction
during mechanical transmission. 

This was remedied when Lockheed intro-

duced a hydraulically actuated brake in
1919. A special brake fluid now transmitted
the brake pedal force uniformly to the actu-
ating cylinders of the wheel brakes over
metal lines and hoses, without the need for
levers, joints and cables. 

Hydraulic brake activation also made it pos-
sible to amplify the foot pressure applied by
the driver by using intake manifold depres-
sion as a source of power for a brake servo
system. The principle was patented in 1919
by Hispano-Suiza.

On commercial vehicles and railway rolling
stock, air brakes established themselves as
the system of choice.

In 1926, the “Adler Standard” was the first
car in Europe to be equipped with a hy-
draulic brake system. The first hydraulic
braking force reinforcement in auto racing
were used in the Mercedes-Benz “Silver
 Arrows” in 1954. This ultimately became
standard equipment for many mass-produc-
tion vehicles.

Because a possible failure of the brake cir-
cuit could completely disable the early sin-
gle-circuit brakes, the dual-circuit brake was
later prescribed by law. According to VW
Golf developer Dr. Ernst Fiala, the early
“Beetles” (the standard model VWs) still had
a cable-operated brake for that very reason:
at the time it was feared that a hose in the
hydraulic brakes could explode. Later, how-
ever – if only for competitive reasons – the
VW Export and VW Transporter featured
hydraulic braking systems.

History of the brake

137

Disk brake
Although British automaker Lancaster had
patented the disk brake in 1902, it was a long
time until this type of brake was introduced.
Not until some fifty years later, beginning in
1955, did the legendary Citroën DS-19 be-
come the first mass-produced car to be fitted
with disk brakes. The disk brake was derived
from the multi-plate brake and was initially
developed for the aircraft industry. 

In the disk brake, one brake lining presses

the brake disk from the inside and outside.
The brake disk (which is normally made of
cast iron or, less commonly, of steel) is con-
nected to the wheel. Its advantage is its sim-
ple and easy-to-assemble structure. It also
counteracts the reduction in braking effect
caused by overheating and prevents mis-
alignment of the wheels of an axle.

The first German car with disk brakes on the
front wheels was the BMW 502 in 1959. The
first German cars to have disk brakes on all
four wheels were the Mercedes 300 SE, the
Lancia Flavia and the Fiat 2300 in 1961.
 Today, virtually all cars have a disk braking
system, at least on the front wheels. In 1974,
the first Formula 1 racecars with carbon
fiber composite brake disks were introduced.
These disks are considered especially light
and heat resistant and thus have gained
widespread use in motorsports and aviation.

Brake pads and shoes
Suitable brake linings had to be developed
for drum and disk brakes, for which asbestos
proved to be particularly effective. Not until
it became known that asbestos fibers were
harmful to health was the material replaced
by plastic fiber.

Driving stability systems
The age of electronic brake systems dawned
in 1978 with the arrival of the antilock brak-
ing system (ABS) for cars developed by
Bosch. During braking, ABS provides early
detection of the incipient lock of one or
more wheels and prevents wheel locking.
It ensures the steerability of the vehicle and

substantially reduces the danger of skidding.
In 1986, it was followed by the traction
 control system (TCS) with which Bosch
 extended system capability to the control
of wheel spin under acceleration. 
Fig. 11 shows road tests of these systems on
the Bosch proving grounds in Boxberg in
southern Germany.

As a further improvement of driving safety,
Bosch introduced the electronic stability
program (ESP) in 1995, which integrates the
functions of ABS and TCS. It not only pre-
vents the vehicle wheels from locking and
spinning, it also keeps the vehicle from
pulling to the side. Alternative systems, such
as four-wheel steering and rear-axle kine-
matics, which were developed in the 1980s
and 90s and were installed in some mass-
production vehicles, did not catch on be-
cause they weighed too much, cost too much
or were not effective enough.

Meanwhile, the (electrohydraulic) sen-
sotronic brake control has found its place in
automobile construction. It provides all of
the ESP functions and decouples the me-
chanical operation of the brake pedal by
means of an electronic control system. For
safety purposes, a hydraulic fallback system
is automatically available.

Car braking systems

Classification of car braking systems

Classification of 
car braking systems

The entirety of the braking systems on a
 vehicle is referred to as braking equipment.
Car braking systems can be classified on the
basis of
(cid:2) design and
(cid:2) method of operation

Designs
Based on legal requirements, the functions of
the braking equipment are shared among three
braking systems:
(cid:2) the service brakes,
(cid:2) the secondary-brake system, and
(cid:2) the parking brake

On commercial vehicles, the braking equip-
ment also includes a continuous-operation
braking system (e.g. retarder) that allows the
driver to keep the vehicle at a steady speed on
a long descent. The braking equipment of a
commercial vehicle also includes an auto-
matic braking system that operates the brakes
of a trailer if it is detached from its towing ve-
hicle either deliberately or by accident.

Service brakes
The service-brake system (“foot brake”) is used
to slow down the vehicle, to keep its speed
constant on a descent, or to bring it com-
pletely to a halt. 

The driver can infinitely vary the braking
 effect by means of the pressure applied to the
brake pedal. 
The service-brake system applies the brakes on
all four wheels.

Secondary-brake system
The secondary-brake system must be capable
of providing at least some degree of braking if
the service-brake system fails. It must be pos-
sible to infinitely vary the level of braking ap-
plied.

The secondary-brake system does not have to
be an entirely separate third braking system (in
addition to the service brakes and the parking
brake) with its own separate actuation device.
It can consist of the remaining intact circuit
of a dual-circuit service-brake system on
which one circuit has failed, or it can be a
parking-brake that is capable of graduated
application. 

Parking-brake system
The parking brake (hand brake) performs the
third function required of the braking equip-
ment. It must prevent the vehicle from mov-
ing when stopped or parked, even on a gradi-
ent and when the vehicle is unattended. 

According to the legal requirements, the
parking-brake system must also have an un-
broken mechanical link, e.g. a rod linkage or a
cable, between the actuation device and the
brakes that it operates. 

The parking-brake system is generally
 operated by means of a hand-brake lever posi-
tioned near the driver’s seat, or in some cases
by a foot pedal. This means that the service
and parking-brake systems of a motor vehicle
have separate actuation devices and means of
force transmission.

The parking-brake system is capable of grad-
uated application and operates the brakes on
one pair of wheels (front or rear) only.

Car braking systems

Classification of car braking systems

139

Methods of operation
Depending on whether they are operated en-
tirely or partially by human effort or by an-
other source of energy, braking systems can
be classed either as 
(cid:2) muscular-energy (unassisted) braking

 systems, 

(cid:2) power-assisted braking systems, or 
(cid:2) power-brake systems, 

Muscular-energy braking systems
On this type of braking system frequently
found on cars and motorcycles, the effort ap-
plied to the brake pedal or hand-brake lever is
transmitted to the brakes either mechanically
(by means of a rod linkage or cable) or hy-
draulically. The energy by which the braking
force is generated is produced entirely by the
physical strength of the driver.

Power-assisted braking systems
The power-assisted braking system is the type
most commonly used on cars and light com-
mercial vehicles. 
It amplifies the force applied by the driver by
means of a brake servo which utilises another
source of energy (vacuum or hydraulic power).
The amplified muscle power is transmitted
hydraulically to the brakes. 

Power-brake systems
Power-brake systems are generally used on
commercial vehicles but are occasionally fitted
on large cars in conjunction with an integral
ABS facility. This type of braking system is
operated entirely without muscular-energy. 

The system is operated by hydraulic power
(which is based on fluid pressure) transmitted
by hydraulic means. The brake fluid is stored
in energy accumulators (hydraulic accumula-
tors) which also contain a compressed gas
(usually nitrogen). The gas and the fluid are
kept apart by a flexible diaphragm (diaphragm
accumulator) or a piston with a rubber seal
(piston accumulator). A hydraulic pump gen-
erates the fluid pressure, which is always in
equilibrium with the gas pressure in the en-
ergy accumulator. A pressure regulator
switches the hydraulic pump to idle as soon
as the maximum pressure is reached. 

Since brake fluid can be regarded as practically
incompressible, small volumes of brake fluid
can transmit large brake-system pressures. 

140

Car braking systems

Components of a car braking system

Components of a car braking
system

Figure 1 shows the schematic layout of a car
braking system. It consists of the following
main component groups: 
(cid:2) Energy supply system,
(cid:2) Actuation device, 
(cid:2) Force transmission system, and
(cid:2) Wheel brakes.

Energy supply system
The energy supply system encompasses those
parts of the braking system that provide, con-
trol and (in some cases) condition the energy
required to operate the brakes. It ends at the
point where the force transmission  system be-
gins, i.e. where the various circuits of the
braking system are isolated from the energy
supply system or from each other. 

Car braking systems are in the main power-
assisted braking systems in which the physical
effort of the driver, amplified by the vacuum
in the brake servo unit, provides the energy
for braking. 

Actuation device
The actuation device encompasses those parts
of a braking system that are used to initiate
and control the action of that braking system.
The control signal may be transmitted within
the actuation device, and the use of an addi-
tional energy source is also possible. 

The actuation device starts at the point at
which the actuation force is directly applied.
It may be operated in the following ways: 
(cid:2) by direct application of force by hand or

foot by the driver, 

(cid:2) by indirect control of force by the driver. 

The actuation device ends at the point where
distribution of the braking-system energy be-
gins or where a portion of that energy is di-
verted for the purpose of controlling braking.
Among the essential components of the actu-
ation device are the vacuum servo unit and
the master cylinder. 

Force transmission system
The force transmission system encompasses
those parts of the braking system that trans mit
the energy introduced by the energy supply sys-
tem(s) and controlled by the actuation de-
vice. It starts at the point where the actuation
device and the energy supply system end. It
ends at the point where it interfaces with
those parts of the braking system that generate
the forces that inhibit or retard vehicle motion.
It may be mechanical or hydromechanical in
design. 

The components of the force transmission

system include the transmission medium,
hoses, pipes and, on some systems, a pressure
regulating valve for limiting the braking force
at the rear wheels. 

Wheelbrakes
The wheelbrakes consist of those parts of the
braking system in which the forces that in-
hibit or retard the movement of the vehicle
are generated. On car braking systems, they
are friction brakes (disc or drum brakes).

Brake-circuit configuration

141

Brake-circuit configuration

Legal requirements demand that braking sys-
tems incorporate a dual-circuit forcetrans-
mission system. 

HI configuration 
This layout involves a front/front-and-rear
split - one brake circuit operates the front and
rear brakes, the other operates only the front
brakes. 

LL configuration 
This arrangement involves a two-front/one-
rear split. Each circuit operates both front
wheels and one rear wheel. 

HH configuration 
The circuits are split front-and-rear/front-
and-rear. Each circuit operates all four wheels.

1

Brake-circuit configuration

According to DIN 74 000, there are five ways
in which the two brake circuits can be split
(Figure 1). It uses the following combinations
of letters to designate the five different con-
figurations: II, X, HI, LL and HH. Those let-
ters are chosen because their shapes roughly
approximate to the layout of the brake lines
connecting the master cylinder and the brakes.
Of those five possibilities, the II and X con-

figurations, which involve the minimum
amount of brake piping, hoses, disconnectable
joints and static or dynamic seals, have become
the most widely established. That characteris-
tic means that the risk of failure of each of
the individual circuits due to fluid leakage is
as low as it is for a single-circuit braking sys-
tem. In the event of brake-circuit failure due
to overheating of one of the brakes, the HI,
LL and HH configurations have a critical
weakness because the connection of individual
brakes to both circuits means that failure of
one brake can result in total failure of the
braking system as a whole. 

In order to satisfy the legal requirements
 regarding secondary-braking effectiveness,
vehicles with a forward weight-distribution
bias are fitted with the X configuration. The II
configuration is particularly suited to use on
cars with a rearward weight-distribution bias. 

II configuration 
This layout involves a front-axle/rear-axle
split – one circuit operates the rear brakes, the
other operates the front brakes. 

X configuration 
This layout involves a diagonal split – each
circuit operates one front brake and its diago-
nally opposed rear brake.

   Vehicle electrical systems     Electrical energy supply in the passenger car

Vehicle electrical systems

The vehicle electrical system of a motor 
vehicle comprises the alternator as the 
energy converter, one or more batteries 
as the energy accumulators and the elec-
trical equipment as consumers. The en-
ergy from the battery is supplied to the 
starter (consumer), which then starts the 
vehicle engine. During vehicle operation, 
the ignition and fuel-injection system, 
the control units, the safety and comfort 
and convenience electronics, the light-
ing, and other equipment have to be 
 supplied with power. 

Electrical energy supply  
in the passenger car 

When the engine is running, the alternator 
supplies electricity which, depending on 
the voltage level in the vehicle electrical 
system (determined by the alternator 
speed and the consumers drawing cur-
rent), is normally enough to power the 
consumers and charge the battery as well. 
If the consumer current draw IV in the ve-
hicle electrical system is greater than the 
alternator current IG (e.g. when the engine 
is idling), the battery is discharged. The 
vehicle system voltage falls to the voltage 
level of the battery from which current is 
drawn. If the consumer current draw IV is 
less than the alternator current output IG,  
a proportion of the current flows to the 

battery and acts as a battery charging 
 current IB. The vehicle system voltage 
 increases to the setpoint value specified  
by the voltage regulator.

With careful selection of the battery, 
 alternator, starter and the other electrical 
system consumers, it must be ensured that 
the charge balance of the battery is indeed 
balanced so that: 

 • It is always possible for the internal-
combustion engine to be started 

 • It allows operation of specific electrical 
consumers for a reasonable period of 
time when the engine is off

The lowest temperature at which the en-
gine can be started depends on a number 
of factors, including the battery (capacity, 
low-temperature test current, state of 
charge, internal resistance, etc.) and the 
starter (design, size, and performance).  
If the engine is started at a temperature  
of –20 °C, for example, the battery must 
have a given minimum state of charge p. 

Apart from the battery itself, the current 
output of the alternator and the power out-
put of the consumers have a decisive influ-
ence on the charge balance of the battery. 

Current output of the alternator

speed-dependent. For an engine idling

speed of nL, the alternator can only supply 
some of its rated current if it has a conven-
tional turns ratio ranging from 1:2 to 1:3 
(crankshaft to alternator). By definition, 
the rated current is output at an  alternator 
speed of 6,000 rpm.

 • The secondary-air pump, which injects 
air immediately after the combustion 
chamber to burn the exhaust gas, runs 
for about 3 minutes after the engine is 
started 

 • Other electrical consumers such as 

Power output of the consumers
The electrical consumers have a variety  
of switch-on durations. A distinction is 
made between continuous consumers 
 (ignition system, fuel injection, etc.), long-
time consumers (lighting, rear-window 
heating, etc.) and short-term consumers 
(turn signals, stop lamps, etc.). 

The use of a number of consumers is de-
pendent on the time of year (air-condition-
ing system, seat heating). The on-time of 
electrical radiator blowers depends on the 
ambient temperature and vehicle opera-
tion. In winter, the vehicle is driven with 
the lights on most of the time. 

The electrical load requirements en-
countered during vehicle operation are 
not constant. The first minutes after 
startup are generally characterized by 
high demand, followed by a sharp drop  
in electrical load requirements: 
 • A windshield heater requires up to  

2 kW for 1 to 3 minutes after the engine  
is started in order to de-ice the wind-
shield

heaters (rear window, seats, mirrors, 
etc.), fans and lights are switched on for 
longer or shorter periods depending on 
the situation, while the engine-manage-
ment system is in operation all the time 

Charging the battery
Due to the chemical processes that take 
place in the battery, the battery charge 
voltage has to be higher at low tempera-
tures and lower at high temperatures. The 
gassing voltage curve shows the maximum 
voltage at which the battery does not pro-
duce gas. A regulator limits the voltage if 
the alternator current IG is greater than 
the sum of the consumer equipment cur-
rent draw IV and the temperature-depen-
dent, maximum permissible battery charg-
ing current IB. Regulators are normally 
mounted on the alternator. If there  
is a significant deviations between the 
temperatures of the voltage regulator and 
the battery electrolyte, it is better to moni-
tor the voltage regulation temperature di-
rectly at the battery. The voltage drop 
across the alternator/battery charging cable 
can be accounted for by a regulator which

    Vehicle electrical systems     Electrical energy supply in the passenger car

measures the actual value of the voltage at 
the battery. 

The arrangement of the alternator, 
 battery and consumers influences the 
 voltage drop on the charging cable and 
thus the charge voltage. The total current 
IG = IB + IV flows through the charging cable 
if all electrical consumers are connected 
to the battery. In response to the relatively 
high voltage drop, the charge voltage falls 
proportionately sharply. 

If all consumers are connected on the 

alternator side, the voltage drop is less 
and the charging voltage is higher. In the 
process, consumers that are sensitive to 
voltage peaks or voltage ripple (electronic 
circuits) may be damaged or suffer mal-
functions. Electrical consumers which fea-
ture a high power input and relative insen-
sitivity to overvoltage should therefore be 
connected close to the alternator, whereas 
voltage-sensitive consumers with a low 
power input should be connected close  
to the battery. 

Voltage drops can be minimized by suit-

able conductor cross-sections and good 
connections with low contact resistance, 
even after a long service life. 

Design of the vehicle electrical system
Dynamic system characteristic curve 
The dynamic system characteristic curve 
maps the relationship between battery 

voltage and battery current during a driv-
ing cycle. The envelopes reflect the inter-
relationships between the battery, alterna-
tor, consumers, temperature, engine 
speed, and engine/alternator speed ratio. 
A large area in the envelope means that, 
with this type of vehicle electrical system, 
significant voltage fluctuations are occur-
ring in the selected driving cycle and that 
the battery undergoes more powerful cy-
clization, i.e. its state of charge experi-
ences powerful temporal changes. The sys-
tem characteristic curve is specific to ev-
ery different combination and every set  
of operating conditions, and is therefore a 
dynamic curve. Measuring systems can be 
connected to the battery terminals to plot 
the dynamic system characteristic curve. 

Charge-balance calculation 
The charge-balance calculation is used as 
the basis for defining the design of the al-
ternator and battery. By means of a com-
puter program, the battery charge level is 
calculated from the consumer load and the 
alternator output power at the end of a 
specified driving cycle. Rush-hour driving 
(low engine speeds) combined with winter 
operation (low charging-current input to 
the battery) is regarded as a normal pas-
senger-car driving cycle. The battery must 
maintain a stable charge balance even un-
der these very unfavorable conditions for

the energy balance of the vehicle electrical 
system.

Driving profile
The driving profile as an input variable  
for the charge-balance calculation is rep-
resented by the cumulative-frequency 
curve of the engine speed. It describes 
how often a specific engine speed is 
reached or exceeded. 

In urban driving situations in rush-hour 
driving, a car’s engine is running at idle 
speed for a large part of the time due to  
the frequency of stops at traffic lights and 
consequently high traffic density. 

A city bus running on scheduled routes 
has a high idle percentage time due to 
 interruptions in driving at bus stops. 
 Another factor that has a negative effect  
on the battery’s charge balance is electrical 
consumers that are operated when the en-
gine is switched off. Long-distance buses 
generally spend only a small proportion  
of the time with the engine at idle speed, 
but on the other hand may have periods 
when consumers with a high power input 
are operated with the engine switched off.

Vehicle electrical system simulation
Contrary to the momentary view using a 
charge-balance calculation, model-based 

computer simulations can calculate elec-
trical system power supply status at any 
time during the trip. They can also include 
electrical system management systems  
and assess their effectiveness.

In addition to adjusting current levels  
in the battery, it is possible to record the 
vehicle-system voltage characteristic 
curve and the battery cycle at any time 
during a trip. Calculations performed us-
ing vehicle electrical system simulations 
are always useful when it comes to com-
paring electrical-system typologies and 
 assessing the effectiveness of consumers 
with a high dynamic response or only  
brief switch-on durations.

Fuel consumption 
Since one of the factors that affects the  
fuel consumption of a vehicle is its mass, 
the mass of the alternator is also an influ-
ence on consumption. 

Even the generation of power by the 
 alternator has an effect on fuel consump-
tion: the additional consumption at 100 W 
of generated electrical output is in the or-
der of 0.17 l per 100 km and depends on 
the efficiency of the alternator. For this 
reason, alternators with higher mid-range 
efficiency levels generally contribute to 
the engine’s fuel efficiency despite being 
slightly heavier in weight.

    Vehicle electrical systems     Electrical energy management

Electrical energy management 

An electrical energy management (EEM) 
system coordinates the interaction be-
tween alternator, voltage transformer, 
 batteries and electrical consumers when 
the vehicle is in use. When the vehicle is 
parked, the EEM monitors the batteries, 
and switches standstill-draw and constant-
draw consumers off as soon as the battery 
charge reaches a critical limit. The EEM 
regulates the entire electrical energy bal-
ance. It compares the power demand from 
the consumers with the power available 
within the vehicle electrical system and 
maintains a constant balance between 
 supply and power output. 

The basis for the EEM is the battery man-
agement. The objective of the battery man-
agement is to communicate to the EEM 
 information about the current state of the 
battery and about predicted electrical be-
havior. Using this information, it is possi-
ble to implement operating strategies for 
increasing vehicle availability and profit-
ability. 

The battery management communicates to 
the EEM the variables relevant to the bat-
tery, e.g. the state of charge (SOC), the state 
of health (SOH) and the state of function 
(SOF) of the battery. SOF is a prediction 
of how the battery would react to a pre-
defined load profile, e.g. whether a start-
ing operation would be successful with the 
current battery status.

These values are calculated using com-

plex, model-based algorithms from the 
measurement of battery current, voltage 
and temperature.

Using this battery data, the EEM is able to 
determine the optimal charge voltage and 
reduce the load on the electrical system 
(switch off consumers) in response to  
a  degrading state of function and/or 
 increase power generation (e.g. by in-
creasing the idling speed).

If the battery’s state of function falls 
 below a specified threshold value despite 
the measures that have been implemented, 
the EEM can warn the driver that certain 
functions (e.g. engine start) will not be 
available with the current battery status.

Battery status recognition
The control unit that makes battery status 
recognition (BSR) possible is the electronic 
battery sensor EBS (sometimes even EEM 
functions are implemented in this control 
unit). The sensor with integrated evalua-
tion electronics records the fundamental 
battery variables of voltage, current and 
temperature. From these variables, it uses 
complex software algorithms to calculate 
the variables that describe the status of  
the car battery. 

The electronic battery sensor comprises a 
chip, which contains the entire electronics, 
and a resistor element for current mea-
surement. Together with the terminal clip, 
both of these form a single assembly unit 
that can be connected directly to the car 
battery and fits into the terminal recess  
of conventional car batteries. 

 • Assurance of startability (SOF) through 
compliance with defined limit values of 
the battery state of function and an in-
crease in vehicle availability

 • Reductions in electrical load require-

ments and reductions in fuel consump-
tion by means of alternator management 
with adaptation of alternator voltage
 • Greater flexibility in the design of bat-
tery and alternator size by means of 
 superordinate energy management 
 (optimal economic efficiency)

 • Extension of battery life (e.g. through 
prevention of exhaustive discharge)

 • Battery change indication

For stop/start applications, the following 
functions can also be fulfilled: 
 • Prediction of startability after a defined 
stationary period (time, temperature, 
no-load current, power consumption 
during the stop phase) 

The following tasks of the electrical energy 
management are made possible by the use 
of battery status recognition:

 • Assurance of a battery charge reserve  
in the stop phase (e.g. by switching off 
consumers)

   Vehicle electrical systems     Two-battery vehicle  electrical system

Two-battery vehicle  
 electrical system

In the design of a vehicle battery, which 
supplies both the starter and the other 
consumers in the vehicle electrical system, 
a compromise has to be found between 
 different requirements. 

During the engine starting sequence, the 

battery is subjected to high current loads 
(300 to 500 A). The associated voltage 
drop has an adverse effect on certain elec-
trical consumers (e.g. units with microcon-
troller) and should be as low as possible. 
On the other hand, only comparatively low 
currents flow during vehicle operation;  
for a reliable power supply, the capacity of 
the battery is the decisive factor. Neither 
properties – rated output nor capacity – 
can be optimized simultaneously. 

In vehicle electrical systems with two 
batteries (starter battery and general-pur-
pose battery), the "high power for starting" 
and "general-purpose electrical supply" 
functions are separated by the electrical 
system control unit to make it possible to 
avoid the voltage drop during the start-
ing process, while ensuring reliable cold 
starts, even when the charge level of the 
general-purpose battery is low. 

Starter battery 
The starter battery must supply a high 
amount of current for only a limited period 
of time (during starting). It is therefore de-

9 Two-battery vehicle electrical system (schematic)

signed for a high power density (high power 
for low weight). Compact dimensions allow 
installation in the immediate vicinity of the 
starter motor with short connecting cables. 
The capacity is reduced. 

General-purpose battery 
This battery only supplies the vehicle elec-
trical system (excluding the starter). It pro-
vides currents for supplying the consumers 
of the vehicle electrical system (e.g.  approx. 
20 A for the engine-management system) 
but has a high cyclic capability, i.e. it can 
supply and store large amounts of power. 
Dimensioning is based essentially on the 
capacity reserves required for activated 
consumers, the consumers that operate 
with the engine switched off (e.g. no-load-
current consumers, parking lights, hazard 
warning flashers, immobilizer), and the 
minimum permissible charge level. 

Vehicle electrical system control unit
The vehicle electrical system control unit 
(EN ECU) in a two-battery vehicle electri-
cal system separates the starter battery 
and the starter from the rest of the vehicle 
electrical system provided this can be sup-
plied with sufficient power by the general-
purpose battery. It therefore prevents the 
voltage drop that occurs during starting, 
affecting the performance of the vehicle 
electrical system. When the vehicle is 
parked, it prevents the starter battery 
from becoming discharged by activated

consumers with the engine switched off 
and standstill-draw consumers.

By separation of the starting system 
from the remainder of the vehicle electri-
cal system, there are theoretically no limits 
for the voltage level within the starting 
system. Consequently, the charge voltage 
can be optimally adapted to the starter 
battery by a DC/DC converter to minimize 
the charging time. 

If there is no charge in the general-pur-

pose battery, the control unit is capable  
of provisionally connecting both vehicle 
electrical systems. This means that the 
 vehicle electrical system can be sustained 
using the fully-charged starter battery. In 
another possible configuration, the control 
unit for the starting operation would con-
nect only the start-related consumers to 
whichever battery was fully charged.

Vehicle electrical systems 
for commercial vehicles

Battery changeover 12/24 V
Various heavy commercial vehicles have a 
combined 12/24 V system, i.e. the supply 
voltage can be switched between 12 and 
24 V. In such cases, the alternator for volt-
age generation and the electrical compo-
nents (starter excepted) are designed for 
nominal 12 V operation. The starter has a 
nominal voltage of 24 V. It is therefore pos-
sible to achieve the power output required 
to start larger diesel engines, for example.

The system consists of two 12 V batteries 
that are connected in parallel during vehi-
cle operation and with the engine switched 
off. The voltage is no different with the 
parallel connection; the vehicle electrical 
system is supplied with 12 V. The total

 capacity of the two batteries is the sum of 
the individual  capacities. 

When the ignition switch is turned,  
a battery changeover relay automatically 
switches the two batteries in series so that 
24 V is applied across the starting-motor 
terminals during the cranking process. All 
other consumers are still supplied with 12 V.
As soon as the engine has started, that is 
when the ignition switch has been released 
and the starting motor switched off, the 
battery changeover relay automatically 
connects the batteries in parallel again. 
With the engine turning, the 12 V alterna-
tor recharges both batteries.

The capacities of two batteries connected 
in parallel should be equal to achieve 
 uniform current distribution during the 
charging and discharging process. From 
the wiring viewpoint, connections should 
also be as symmetrical as possible, with 
identical lengths of connection cable and 
conductor cross-sections.

Components in the vehicle electrical 
system 
At the present time, the components de-
scribed can also be used in passenger-car 
electrical systems. Here, however, they  
are not common and tend to be fitted as 
optional equipment.

Battery master switch
Generally, the vehicle’s electrical installa-
tion is wired such that when the key is 
pulled from the ignition switch the electri-
cal lines leading from the switch to, for 
 example, the ignition system, the control 
units (Motronic, ABS), the wipers, etc. are 
no longer supplied with current.

On the other hand, the lines leading to 
the ignition switch, to the starter, and to 
the light switch remain “live”. In other 
words there is still voltage on these lines, 
and if they have frayed or worn-through 
points these can lead to low resistances 
which can cause leakage currents or short 
circuits which  result in a discharged bat-
tery. The consequences are a discharged 
battery or the  possibility of a fire. A bat-
tery master switch makes it possible to 
completely isolate the battery from the 
 vehicle electrical system to eliminate the 
risk of these dangers.

The single-pole battery master switch  
is installed in the battery’s ground cable 
(negative terminal) as near to the battery 
as possible. It should be within convenient 
reach of the driver.

On installations equipped with three-

phase current alternators, due to the danger 
of voltage peaks (with the attendant destruc-
tion of electronic components), it is forbid-
den to operate the vehicle without the bat-

tery connected. On such installations there-
fore, the battery master switch may only be 
actuated with the engine at standstill. 

Battery relay 
Legislation stipulates that in buses, road 
tankers etc. a battery relay must be in-
stalled as the master switch to separate the 
vehicle electrical system from the battery. 
Not only short circuits are avoided (during 
repairs for instance), but also the decom-
position effects due to leakage currents  
on current-carrying components.

For this type of installation with three-
phase current alternator, in order to pre-
vent  excessive voltage peaks it is neces-
sary to fit a 2-pole electromagnetic battery 
main switch. This prevents the alternator 
being separated from the battery when the 
engine is running.

Battery-cutoff relay
The battery-cutoff relay (NO contact) sepa-
rates the starter battery from a second bat-
tery used for ancillary equipment. It pro-
tects the starter battery against discharge 
when the three-phase current alternator is 
not delivering charge current. This relay is 
provided with a diode for reverse-polarity 
protection, and a decay diode to suppress 
the inductive voltage peaks caused by 
switching.

Battery charging relay
The battery charging relay is needed when 
an additional 12V battery is to be charged in 
a 24 V vehicle system voltage. It is provided 
with resistors across which at 10 A charging 
current a voltage drop takes place which 
 reduces the charge voltage to 12 V. This of 
course necessitates the 24 V alternator be-
ing able to generate the additional 10 A.

    Vehicle electrical systems     Wiring harnesses

Wiring harnesses

Requirements
The purpose of the wiring harness is to 
distribute power and signals within a mo-
tor vehicle. A wiring harness in the present 
day, mid-class passenger car with average 
equipment has approximately 750 differ-
ent lines, their length totaling around 
1,500 meters. In recent years the number 
of contact points has practically doubled 
due to the continuous rise in functions in 
the motor vehicle. A distinction is made 
between the engine compartment and 
body wiring harness. The latter is subject 
to less demanding temperature, vibration, 
media and tightness requirements.

Wiring harnesses have considerable 
 influence on the costs and quality of a 
 vehicle. The following points must be 
taken into consideration in wiring harness 
development:

(cid:5)  Leak-tightness 
(cid:5)  EMC compatibility 
(cid:5)  Temperatures 
(cid:5)  Damage protection for the lines
(cid:5)  Line routing
(cid:5)  Ventilation of the wiring harness

It is therefore necessary to involve wiring 
harness experts as soon as in the system 
definition stage. Figure 1 shows a wiring 
harness that was developed as a special 
 intake-module wiring harness. Thanks to 
the optimization of routing and security  
in conjunction with engine and wiring 
 harness development, it was possible to 
achieve an advancement of quality as well 
as to yield cost and weight advantages.

Line cross-sections 
Line cross-sections are defined based  
on permissible voltage drops. The lower 
cross-section limit is determined by the 
line strength. Convention has it that no 
lines with a cross-section of less than 
0.5 mm2 are used. With additional mea-
sures (e.g. supports, protective tubes, 
 tension relief), even a cross-section of 
0.35 mm2 may be permissible.

Materials
Copper is usually used as the conductive 
material. The insulation materials for the 
lines are defined by the temperature to 
which they are exposed. It is necessary  
to use materials that are suitable for the 
high temperatures of continuous opera-
tion. Here, the ambient temperature must 
be taken into consideration as much as  
the heating caused by the flow of current. 
The materials used are thermoplastics  
(e.g. PE, PA, PVC), fluoropolymers (e.g. 
ETFE, FEP) and elastomers (e.g. CSM, SIR).
If the lines are not routed past particu-

larly hot parts (e.g. exhaust pipe) in the 
 engine topology, one of the criteria for the 
selection of the insulation material and the 
cable cross-section could be the derating 
curve of the contact with its associated 
line. The derating curve represents the 
 relationship between current, the temper-
ature increase that it causes, and the ambi-
ent temperature of the plug-in connection. 
Normally, the heat generated in the con-
tacts can only be carried away along the 
lines themselves. It should also be noted 
that the change in temperatures results  
in a change in the modulus of elasticity  
of the contact material (metal relaxation). 
It is possible to influence the relationships 
described by means of larger line cross-
sections and the use of suitable contact 
types and more noble surfaces (e.g. gold, 
silver) and thus higher limit temperatures. 
For highly fluctuating current intensities, 
it is often useful to measure the contact 
temperature.

Plug-in connections and contacts 
The type of plug-in connections and con-
tacts used depends on various factors:
(cid:5)  Current intensity 
(cid:5)  Ambient temperatures 
(cid:5)  Vibration load 
(cid:5)  Resistance to media and 
(cid:5)  Installation space 

Line routing and EMC measures
Lines should be routed in such a way  
as to prevent damage and line breaks.  
This is achieved by means of fasteners and 
supports. Vibration loads on contacts and 
plug-in connections are reduced by fasten-
ing the wiring harness as close to the plug 
as possible and at the same level as the vi-
bration where possible. The line routing 
must be determined in close cooperation 
with the engine and vehicle developers.

Where EMC problems arise, it is recom-
mended to route sensitive lines and lines 
with steep current flanks separately. 
Shielded lines are not straightforward  
to produce and are therefore expensive. 
They also need to be grounded. The twist-
ing of lines is a more cost-favorable and 
 effective measure.

Line protection
Lines need to be protected against chafing 
and against making contact with sharp 
edges and hot surfaces. Adhesive tapes  
are used for this purpose. The level of 
 protection is determined by the interval 
and winding density. Corrugated tubing 
(material savings from corrugation) with 
the necessary connecting pieces are  
often used as line protection. However, 
tape  fixing is still an essential means of 
preventing movement of individual lines 
inside the corrugated tube. Optimal pro-
tection is offered by cable ducts.

    Vehicle electrical systems     Plug-in connections

Plug-in connections

Design and requirements
The high integration density of electronics 
in the motor vehicle places high demands 
on a car’s plug-in connections. Not only do 
they carry high currents (e.g. activation of 
ignition coils), they also carry analog sig-
nal currents with low voltage and current 
intensity (e.g. signal voltage of the engine 
temperature sensor). Throughout the 
 service life of the vehicle, the plug-in con-
nections must ensure the reliable trans-
mission of signals between control units 
and to the sensors whilst maintaining 
 tolerances. 

The increasing demands of emission-

control legislation and active vehicle 
safety are forcing the ever more precise 
transmission of signals through the con-
tacts of the plug-in connections. A large 
number of parameters must be taken  
into consideration in the design, arrange-
ment and testing of the plug-in connec-
tions (Fig. 1).

The most common cause of failure of a 
plug-in connection is wearing of the con-
tact caused by vibrations or temperature 
change. The wear promotes oxidation. 
This results in an increase in ohmic 

 resistance – the contact may, for example, 
be subjected to thermal overload. The con-
tact part may be heated beyond the melt-
ing point of the copper alloy. In the case of 
highly resistant signal contacts, the vehicle 
controller often detects a plausibility error 
by comparison with other signals; the con-
troller then enters fault mode. These prob-
lem areas in the plug-in connection are di-
agnosed by the on-board diagnosis (OBD) 
required by emission-control legislation. 
However, it is difficult to diagnose the er-
ror in the service workshops because this 
defect is displayed as being a component 
failure. It is only possible to diagnose the 
faulty contact indirectly. 

For the assembly of the plug-in connec-
tion, there are various functional elements 
on the plug housing intended to ensure 
that the cables with their crimped contacts 
can be joined to the plug-in connection 
 reliably and defect-free. Modern plug-in 
connections have a joining force of < 100 N 
so that the assembly operative is able to 
reliably join the connector to the compo-
nent or control-unit interface. The risk  
of plug-in connections being connected  
to the interface incorrectly increases with 
higher connecting forces. The plug would 
come loose during vehicle operation.

application (Table 1). These are character-
ized by the number of poles and ambient 
conditions. There are different classes of 
plug-in connection: hard engine attach-
ment, soft engine attachment, and body 
 attachment. Another difference is the 
 temperature class of the installation 
 location.

High-pin-count plug-in connections
High-pin-count plug-in connections are 
used for all control units in the vehicle. 
They differ in their number of poles and 
the geometry of the pins. Figure 2 shows  
a typical design of a high-pin-count plug-
in connection. The complete plug-in con-
nection is sealed at the connector strip of 
the respective control unit by means of a 
continuous radial seal in the plug housing. 
This, together with three sealing lips, 
 ensures a reliable seal against the control 
unit sealing collar.

The contacts are protected against the 
ingress of humidity along the cable by a 
seal plate, through which the contacts are 
inserted and the line crimped to them.  
A silica-gel mat or silica mat is used for 
this purpose. Larger contacts and lines  
may also be sealed using a single-core  
seal (see “Low-pin-count plug-in connec-
tions”).

When the plug is assembled, the contact 

with the line attached is inserted through 
the seal plate that is already in the plug. The 
contact slides home into its position in the 
contact carrier. The contact latches on its 
own by a locking spring that engages in an 
undercut in the plastic housing of the plug.

Once all contacts are in their final position, 
a slide pin is inserted to provide a second 
contact safeguard, or secondary lock. This 
is an additional security measure and in-
creases the retaining force of the contact 
in the plug-in connection. In addition, the 
sliding movement is a means of checking 
that the contacts are in the correct posi-
tion. The operating force of the plug-in 
connection is reduced by a lever and a 
slider mechanism.

Low-pin-count plug-in connections
Low-pin-count plug-in connections are  
used for actuators (e.g. fuel injectors) and 
sensors. Their design is similar in princi-
ple to that of a high-pin-count plug-in 
 connection (Fig. 3). The operating force  
of the plug-in connection is not usually 
supported.

The connection between a low-pin-
count plug contact system and the inter-
face is sealed with a radial seal. Inside  
the plastic housing, however, the lines  
are sealed with single-core seals secured 
to the contact.

Contact systems
Two-part contact systems are used in the 
motor vehicle. The inner part (Fig. 4) –  
the live part – is pressed from a high-qual-
ity copper alloy. It is protected by a steel 
overspring, which at the same time in-
creases the contact forces of the contact  
by means of an inwardly acting spring 
 element. A catch arm pressed out from the 
steel overspring engages the contact in the 
plastic housing part. Contacts are coated 
with tin, silver or gold, depending on re-
quirements. To improve the wear charac-
teristics of the contact point, not only are 
different contact coatings used but also 
different structural shapes. Different de-
coupling mechanisms are integrated into 
the contact part to decouple cable vibra-
tions from the contact point (e.g. meander-
ing routing of the supply lead).

The cables are crimped onto the contact. 
The crimp geometry on the contact must 
be adapted to the cable concerned. Pliers 
or fully automatic, process-monitored 
crimping presses with contact-specific 
tools are available for the crimping pro-
cess.

Overview of electrical and electronic 
systems in the vehicle

The amount of electronics in the vehicle 
has risen dramatically in recent years 
and is set to increase yet further in the 
future. Technical developments in semi-
conductor technology support ever more 
complex functions with the increasing 
integration density. The functionality of 
electronic systems in motor vehicles has 
now surpassed even the capabilities of 
the Apollo 11 space module that orbited 
the Moon in 1969.

Overview

Development of electronic systems
Not least in contributing to the success of 
the vehicle has been the continuous string 
of innovations which have found their way 
into vehicles. Even as far back as the 1970s, 
the aim was to make use of new technolo-
gies to help in the development of safe, 
clean and economical cars. The pursuit of 
economic efficiency and cleanliness was 
closely linked to other customer benefits 

1 Electronics in the motor vehicle

such as driving pleasure. This was charac-
terized by the European diesel boom, upon 
which Bosch had such a considerable influ-
ence. At the same time, the development of 
the gasoline engine with gasoline direct in-
jection, which would reduce fuel consump-
tion by comparison with intake-manifold in-
jection, experienced further advancements.
An improvement in driving safety was 

achieved with electronic brake-control 
systems. In 1978, the antilock brake 
 system (ABS) was introduced and under-
went continual development to such an 
 extent that it is now fitted as standard on 
every vehicle in Europe. It was along this 
same line of development that the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP), in which 
ABS is integrated, would debut in 1995.

The latest developments also take com-

fort into account. These include the hill 
hold control (HHC) function, for example, 
which makes it easier to pull away on up-
hill gradients. This function is integrated 
in ESP.

Many kinds of new functions appear in 
conjunction with driver-assistance sys-
tems. Their scope extends far beyond to-
day’s standard features such as Parkpilot 
or electronic navigation systems. The aim 
is to produce the “sensitive vehicle” that 
uses sensors and electronics to detect and 
interpret its surroundings. Tapping into 
ultrasound, radar and video sensor tech-
nologies has led to solutions that play an 
important role in assisting the driver, e.g. 
through improved night vision or distance 
control.

Value creation structure for the future
The latest studies show that the produc-
tion costs of an average car will increase 
only slightly by 2010 despite further inno-
vations. No significant value growth for 
 existing systems is expected in the me-
chanics/hydraulics domain despite the 
 expected volume growth. One reason  
here being the electrification of functions 
that have conventionally been realized me-
chanically or hydraulically. Brake control 
systems are an impressive example of this 
change. While the conventional brake sys-
tem was characterized more or less com-
pletely by mechanical components, the  
introduction of the ABS brake-control  
system was accompanied by a greater 
 proportion of electronic components in

the form of sensor technology and an 
 electronic control unit. With the more re-
cent developments of ESP, the additional 
functions, such as HHC, are almost exclu-
sively realized by electronics.

Even though significant economies  
of scale are seen with the established 
 solutions, the value of the electrics and 
electronics will increase overall (Fig. 1).  
By 2010, this will amount to a good third of 
the production costs of an average vehicle. 
This assumption is based not least on the 
fact that the majority of future functions 
will also be regulated by electrics and elec-
tronics.

The increase in electrics and electronics 

is associated with a growth in software. 
Even today, software development costs 
are no longer negligible by comparison 
with hardware costs. Software authoring is 
faced with two challenges arising from the 
resulting increase in complexity of a vehi-
cle’s overall system: coping with the vol-
ume and a clearly structured architecture. 
The Autosar initiative (Automotive Open 
Systems Architecture), in which various 
motor vehicle manufacturers and suppli-
ers participate, is working towards a stan-
dardization of electronics architecture 
with the aim of reducing complexity 
through increased reusability and inter-
changeability of software modules.

 Overview of electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle     Overview

Task of an electronic system
Open-loop and closed-loop control
The nerve center of an electronic system is 
the control unit. Figure 3 shows the system 
blocks of a Motronic engine-management 
system. All the open-loop and closed-loop 
algorithms of the electronic system run in-
side the control unit. The heart of the con-
trol unit is a microcontroller with the pro-
gram memory (flash EPROM) in which is 
stored the program code for all functions 
that the control unit is designed to execute.
The input variables for the sequence 
control are derived from the signals from 
sensors and setpoint generators. They in-
fluence the calculations in the algorithms, 
and thus the triggering signals for the ac-
tuators. These convert into mechanical 
variables the electrical signals that are 
output by the microcontroller and ampli-
fied in the output stage modules. This 
could be mechanical energy generated by 
a servomotor (power-window unit), for ex-
ample, or thermal energy generated by a 
sheathed-element glow plug. 

3 Function modules of an electronic system

Communication
Many systems have a mutual influence on 
each other. For example, it may sometimes 
be necessary to not only have the elec-
tronic stability program carry out a brak-
ing intervention in the event wheel spin 
but also to request that the engine-man-
agement system reduce torque and thus 
counteract wheel spin. Similarly, the con-
trol unit for the automatic transmission 
outputs a request to the engine-manage-
ment system to reduce torque during a 
gearshift and thereby promote a soft gear 
change. To this end, the systems are net-
worked with each other, i.e. they are able 
to communicate with each other on data 
buses (e.g. CAN, LIN).  

In a premium-class vehicle, there may  
be up to 80 control units performing their 
 duties. The examples below are intended 
to give you an insight into the operating 
principle of these systems.

Control of gasoline engines

sumption but at the same time

 • Evaporative emission control system:  

“Motronic” is the name of an engine-man-
agement system that facilitates open- and 
closed-loop control of gasoline engines 
within a single control unit. 

There are Motronic variants for engines 

with intake-manifold injection (ME Mo-
tronic) and for gasoline direct injection  
(DI Motronic). Another variant is the Bifuel 
Motronic, which also controls the engine 
for operation with natural gas.

System description
Functions 
The primary task of the Motronic engine-
management system is: 
 • To adjust the torque desired and input 

by the driver depressing the accelerator 
pedal

 • To operate the engine in such a way as  

to comply with the requirements of ever 
more stringent emission-control legisla-
tion

 • To ensure the lowest possible fuel con-

 • To guarantee high levels of driving com-

fort and driving pleasure

Components
Motronic comprises all the components 
which control and regulate the gasoline 
engine (Fig. 1, next page). The torque re-
quested by the driver is adjusted by means 
of actuators or converters. The main indi-
vidual components are:
 • The electrically actuated throttle valve 
(air system): this regulates the air-mass 
flow to the cylinders and thus the cylin-
der charge

 • The fuel injectors (fuel system): these 

meter the correct amount of fuel for the 
cylinder charge

 • The ignition coils and spark plugs (igni-
tion system): these provide for correctly 
timed ignition of the air-fuel mixture 
present in the cylinder 

Depending on the vehicle, different measures 
may be required to fulfill the requirements 
demanded of the engine-management sys-
tem (e.g. in respect of emission character-
istics, power output and fuel consump-
tion). Examples of system components 
able to be controlled by Motronic are: 
 • Variable camshaft control: it is possible 
to use the variability of valve timing and 
valve lifts to influence the ratio of fresh 
gas to residual exhaust gas and the mix-
ture formation

 • External exhaust-gas recirculation: 

 adjustment of the residual gas content 
by means of a precise and deliberate 
 return of exhaust gas from the exhaust 
train (adjustment by the exhaust-gas 
 recirculation valve)

 • Exhaust-gas turbocharging: regulated 
supercharging of the combustion air  
(i.e. increase in the fresh air mass in  
the combustion chamber) to increase 
torque

for the return of fuel vapors that escape 
from the fuel tank and are collected in 
an activated charcoal canister

Operating variable acquisition
Motronic uses sensors to record the operat-
ing variables required for the open and 
closed-loop control of the engine (e.g. en-
gine speed, engine temperature, battery 
voltage, intake air mass, intake-manifold 
pressure, Lambda value of the exhaust gas).
Setpoint generators (e.g. switches) re-
cord the adjustments made by the driver 
(e.g. position of the ignition key, cruise 
control).

Operating variable processing
From the input signals, the engine ECU  
detects the current operating status of the 
engine and uses this information in con-
junction with requests from auxiliary sys-
tems and from the driver (accelerator-
pedal sensor and operating switches)  
to calculate the command signals for  
the actuators.

Control of gasoline engines     Fuel system                            163

In gasoline injection systems with intake 
manifold injection, the fuel is introduced 
into the intake duct upstream of the intake 
valves. To this end, the electric fuel-supply 
pump (27) delivers fuel (primary pressure 
up to approximately 450 kPa) to the fuel 
injectors. Each cylinder is assigned a fuel 
injector that injects the fuel at intermittent 
intervals. The air-fuel mixture in the intake 
passage flows into the cylinder during the 
induction stroke. Corrections are made  
to the injected fuel quantity, e.g. by the 
Lambda control (Lambda oxygen sensor, 
12) and the canister purge (evaporative-
emissions control system, 1, 4).

With gasoline direct injection, fresh air 
flows into the cylinder. The fuel is injected 
directly into the combustion chamber by 
high-pressure fuel injectors (8) where it 
forms an air-fuel mixture with the intake 
air. This requires a higher fuel pressure, 
which is generated by additional high-
pressure pump (7). The pressure can be 
variably adjusted (up to 20 MPa) in line 
with the operating point by an integrated 
fuel-supply control valve.

Air system
A specific air-fuel mixture is required to 
achieve the desired torque. For this pur-
pose, the throttle valve (Fig. 1, Item 3) reg-
ulates the air necessary for the mixture 
formation by adjusting the metering orifice 
in the intake port for the fresh air taken  
in by the cylinders. This is effected by a  
DC motor (Fig. 2) integrated in the throttle 
device that is controlled by the Motronic 
control unit. The position of the throttle 
valve is fed back to the control unit by a 
position sensor to make position control 
possible. This sensor may be in the form  
of a potentiometer, for example. Since the 
throttle device is a component relevant to 
safety, the sensor is designed with redun-
dancy. 

The intake air mass (air charge) is re-
corded by sensors (e.g. hot-film air-mass 
meter, intake-manifold pressure sensor). 

Fuel system
The control unit (Fig. 1, Item 13) calculates 
the fuel volume required from the intake 
air mass and the current operating status 
of the engine (e.g. intake-manifold pres-
sure, engine speed), and also the time at 
which fuel injection should take place.

Control of gasoline engines     Fuel injector for intake manifold injection

Fuel injector for intake-manifold  
injection
Function
The electromagnetic (solenoid-controlled) 
fuel injectors spray the fuel into the intake 
manifold at primary pressure. They allow 
fuel to be metered in the precise quantity 
required by the engine. They are actuated 
by driver stages which are integrated in 
the engine ECU with the signal calculated 
by the engine-management system.

3 EV14 electromagnetic fuel injector

Design and operating principle
Essentially, electromagnetic fuel injectors 
(Fig. 3) are comprised of the following 
components: 
(cid:5)  Valve housing (3) with electrical connec-

tion (4) and hydraulic port (1)

(cid:5)  Solenoid coil (9)
(cid:5)  Moving valve needle (10) with solenoid 

armature and valve ball (11) 

(cid:5)  Valve seat (12) with injection-orifice 

plate (13) and
(cid:5)  Valve spring (8)

In order to ensure trouble-free operation, 
stainless steel is used for the parts of the 
fuel injector which come into contact with 
fuel. The fuel injector is protected against 
dirt by a filter strainer (6) at the fuel inlet.

Connections
On the fuel injectors presently in use,  
fuel supply to the fuel injector is in the 
 axial direction, i.e. from top to bottom 
(“top feed”). The fuel line is secured to  
the hydraulic port by means of a clamping 
fixture. Retaining clips ensure reliable 
 fastening. The sealing ring (O-ring) on  
the hydraulic port (2) seals off the fuel  
injector at the fuel rail.

The fuel injector is electrically con-

nected to the engine ECU.

Fuel injector operation
When the solenoid coil is de-energized, 
the valve needle and valve ball are pressed 
against the cone-shaped valve seat by the 
spring and the force exerted by the fuel 
pressure. The fuel-supply system is thus 
sealed off from the intake manifold. When 
the solenoid coil is energized, this gener-
ates a magnetic field which attracts the 
valve-needle solenoid armature. The valve 
ball lifts up from the valve seat and the fuel 
is injected. When the excitation current is 
switched off, the valve needle closes again 
due to spring force.

the injector is activated (injection dura-
tion). The speed at which the valve needle 
lifts off its seat is also dependent on the 
battery voltage. Battery-voltage-depen-
dent injection-duration extension (Fig. 5) 
corrects these influences.

Fuel outlet
The fuel is atomized by means of an injec-
tion-orifice plate in which there are a num-
ber of holes. These holes (injection ori-
fices) are stamped out of the plate and en-
sure that the injected fuel quantity remains 
highly constant. The injection-orifice plate 
is insensitive to fuel deposits. The spray 
pattern of the fuel leaving the injector is 
produced by the number of injection ori-
fices and their configuration. 

The injector is efficiently sealed at the 
valve seat by the cone/ball sealing princi-
ple. The fuel injector is inserted into the 
opening provided for it in the intake mani-
fold. The lower sealing ring provides the 
seal between the fuel injector and the in-
take manifold. 

Essentially, the injected fuel quantity per 
unit of time is determined by 
(cid:5)  The primary pressure in the fuel-supply 

system 

fold and 

(cid:5)  The back pressure in the intake mani-

(cid:5)  The geometry of the fuel-exit area 

Electrical activation
An output module in the Motronic ECU  
actuates the fuel injector with a switching 
signal (Fig. 4a). The current in the solenoid 
coil rises (b) and causes the valve needle 
(c) to lift. The maximum valve lift is 
achieved after the time tpk (pickup time) 
has elapsed. Fuel is sprayed as soon as the 
valve ball lifts off its seat. The total quan-
tity of fuel injected during an injection 
pulse is shown in Figure 4d.

Current flow ceases when activation is 
switched off. Mass inertia causes the valve 
to close, but only slowly. The valve is fully 
closed again after the time tdr (dropout 
time) has elapsed.

When the valve is fully open, the in-
jected fuel quantity is proportional to the 
time. The non-linearity during the valve 
pickup and dropout phases must be com-
pensated for throughout the period that

  Control of gasoline engines     High-pressure fuel injector for gasoline direct injection

High-pressure fuel injector for  
gasoline direct injection
Function
It is the function of the high-pressure fuel 
injector (HDEV) on the one hand to meter 
the fuel and on the other hand by means of 
its atomization to achieve controlled mix-
ing of the fuel and air in a specific area of 
the combustion chamber. Depending on 
the desired operating status, the fuel is  
either concentrated in the vicinity of the 
spark plug (stratified charge) or evenly 
distributed throughout the combustion 
chamber (homogenous distribution).

Design and operating principle
The high-pressure fuel injector (Fig. 6) 
comprises the following components:
(cid:5)  Inlet with filter (1)
(cid:5)  Electrical connection (2)
(cid:5)  Spring (3)
(cid:5)  Coil (4)
(cid:5)  Valve sleeve (5)
(cid:5)  Nozzle needle with solenoid  

armature (6) and

(cid:5)  Valve seat (7)

6 Design of HDEV5 high-pressure fuel injector

A magnetic field is generated when cur-
rent passes through the coil. This lifts the 
valve needle off the valve seat against the 
force of the spring and opens the injector 
outlet bores (8). The primary pressure now 
forces the fuel into the combustion cham-
ber. The injected fuel quantity is essen-
tially dependent on the opening duration 
of the fuel injector and the fuel pressure. 

When the energizing current is switched 

off, the valve needle is pressed by spring 
force back down against its valve seat and 
interrupts the flow of fuel.

Excellent fuel atomization is achieved 
thanks to the suitable nozzle geometry at 
the injector tip. 

Requirements
Compared with manifold injection, gaso-
line direct injection differs mainly in its 
higher fuel pressure and the far shorter 
time which is available for directly inject-
ing the fuel into the combustion chamber.

Control of gasoline engines     High-pressure fuel injector for gasoline direct injection                                      167

Figure 7 underlines the technical demands 
made on the fuel injector. In the case of 
manifold injection, two revolutions of the 
crankshaft are available for injecting the 
fuel into the intake manifold. This corre-
sponds to an injection duration of 20 ms  
at an engine speed of 6,000 rpm. 

In the case of gasoline direct injection, 

however, considerably less time is avail-
able. In homogeneous operation, the fuel 
must be injected during the induction 
stroke. In other words, only a half crank-
shaft rotation is available for the injection 
process. At 6,000 rpm, this corresponds to 
an injection duration of 5 ms.

With gasoline direct injection, the fuel 
requirement at idle in relation to that at 
full load is far lower than with manifold 
 injection (factor 1:12). At idle, this results 
in an injection duration of approx. 0.4 ms.

Actuation of HDEV high-pressure  
fuel injector
The high-pressure fuel injector must be 
actuated with a highly complex current 

curve in order to comply with the require-
ments for defined, reproducible fuel-injec-
tion processes (Fig. 8). The microcon-
troller in the engine ECU only delivers  
a digital triggering signal (a). An output 
module (ASIC) uses this signal to generate 
the triggering signal (b) for the fuel injec-
tor. 

A DC/DC converter in the engine ECU 

generates the booster voltage of 65 V.  
This voltage is required in order to bring 
the current up to a high value as quickly  
as possible in the booster phase. This is 
necessary in order to accelerate the injec-
tor needle as quickly as possible. In the 
pickup phase (tpk), the valve needle then 
achieves the maximum opening lift (c). 
When the fuel injector is open, a small 
control current (holding current) is suffi-
cient to keep the fuel injector open. 

With a constant valve-needle displace-
ment, the injected fuel quantity is propor-
tional to the injection duration (d).

  Control of gasoline engines     Inductive ignition System

Inductive ignition System
Ignition of the air-fuel mixture in the gaso-
line engine is electric; it is produced by 
generating a flashover between the elec-
trodes on a spark plug. The ignition-coil 
energy converted in the spark ignites the 
compressed air-fuel mixture immediately 
adjacent to the spark plug, creating a flame 
front which then spreads to ignite the  
air-fuel mixture in the entire combustion 
chamber. The inductive ignition system 
generates in each power stroke the high 
voltage required for flashover and the 
spark duration required for ignition.  
The electrical energy drawn from the 
 vehicle electrical system is temporarily 
stored in the ignition coil. 

Design
Figure 9 shows the principle layout of  
the ignition circuit of an inductive ignition  
system. It comprises the following compo-
nents: 
 • Ignition driver stage (4), which is inte-
grated in the Motronic ECU or in the  
ignition coil

 • Ignition coils (3)
 • Spark plugs (5) and 
 • Connecting devices and interference 

suppressors

Generating the ignition spark
A magnetic field is built up in the ignition 
coil when a current flows in the primary 
circuit. The ignition energy required for 
ignition is stored in this magnetic field.

The current in the primary winding only 
gradually attains its setpoint value because 
of the induced countervoltage. Because the 
energy stored in the ignition coil is depen-
dent on the current (E = 1/2LI2), a certain 
amount of time (dwell period) is required 
in order to store the energy necessary for 
ignition. This dwell period is dependent 
on, among others, the vehicle system volt-
age. The ECU program calculates from the 
dwell period and the moment of ignition 
the cut-in point, and cuts the ignition coil 
in via the ignition driver stage and out 
again at the moment of ignition.

 Interrupting the coil current at the mo-
ment of ignition causes the magnetic field 
to collapse. This rapid magnetic-field 
change induces a high voltage (Fig. 10)  
on the secondary side of the ignition coil 
as a result of the large number of turns 
(turns ratio approx. 1:100). When the igni-
tion voltage is reached, flashover occurs  
at the spark plug and the compressed  
air-fuel mixture is ignited.

Flame-front propagation
After the flashover, the voltage at the spark 
plug drops to the spark voltage (Fig. 10). 
The spark voltage is dependent on the 
length of the spark plasma (electrode gap 
and deflection due to flow) and ranges be-
tween a few hundred volts and well over 
1 kV. The ignition-coil energy is converted 
in the ignition spark during the combus-
tion time; this ignition spark duration  
lasts from as little as 100 µs to over 2 ms.  
Following the breakaway of the spark,  
the damped voltage decays.

The electrical spark between the spark-
plug electrodes generates a high-tempera-
ture plasma. When the air-fuel mixture at 
the spark plug is ignitable and sufficient 
energy input is supplied by the ignition 
system, the arc that is created develops 
into a self-propagating flame front.

Moment of ignition
The instant at which the ignition spark 
 ignites the air-fuel mixture within the com-
bustion chamber must be selected with 
 extreme precision. This variable has a de-
cisive influence on engine operation and 
determines the output torque, exhaust-gas 
emissions and fuel consumption.

The influencing variables that determine 

the moment of ignition are engine speed 
and engine load, or torque. Additional

variables, such as, for example, engine 
temperature, are also used to determine 
the optimal moment of ignition. These 
variables are recorded by sensors and 
then relayed to the engine ECU (Motronic). 
The moment of ignition is calculated and 
the triggering signal for the ignition driver 
stage is generated from program maps and 
characteristic curves.

Combustion knocks occur if the moment 

of ignition is too advanced. Permanent 
knocking may result in engine damage.  
For this reason, knock sensors are used to 
monitor combustion noise. After a com-
bustion knock, the moment of ignition is 
delayed to too late and then slowly moved 
back to the pilot control value. This helps 
to counteract permanent knocking.

 

Voltage distribution 
Voltage distribution takes place on the pri-
mary side of the ignition coils, which are 
directly connected to the spark plugs 
(static voltage distribution). 

System with single-spark ignition coils
Each cylinder is allocated an ignition 
driver stage and an ignition coil (Figs. 11a 
and 11b). The engine ECU actuates the  
ignition driver stages in specified firing  
order. However, the system does also have 
to be synchronized with the camshaft by 
means of a camshaft sensor. 

System with dual-spark ignition coils
One ignition driver stage and one ignition 
coil are allocated to every two cylinders 
(Fig. 11c). The ends of the secondary wind-
ing are each connected to a spark plug in 
different cylinders. The cylinders have 
been chosen so that when one cylinder is 
in the compression cycle, the other is in 
the exhaust cycle (only possible with en-
gines with an even number of cylinders).  
It does not therefore need to be synchro-
nized with the camshaft. Flashover occurs 
at both spark plugs at the moment of igni-
tion.

  Control of gasoline engines     Ignition coils

Ignition coils
Compact ignition coil
Design
The compact coil’s magnetic circuit con-
sists of the O core and the I core (Fig. 12), 
onto which the primary and secondary 
windings are plugged. This arrangement is 
installed in the coil housing. The primary 
winding (I core wound in wire) is electri-
cally and mechanically connected to the 
primary plug connection. Also connected 
is the start of the secondary winding (coil 
body wound in wire). The connection on 
the spark-plug side of the secondary wind-
ing is also located in the housing, and elec-
trical contacting is established when the 
windings are fitted. 

12 Compact-coil design

Integrated within the housing is the high-
voltage contact dome. This contains the 
contact section for spark-plug contacting, 
and also a silicone jacket for insulating the 
high voltage from external components 
and the spark-plug well. 

Following component assembly resin  
is vacuum-injected into the inside of the 
housing, where it is allowed to harden. 
This produces high mechanical strength, 
good protection from environmental influ-
ences and outstanding insulation of the 
high voltage. The silicone jacket is then 
pushed onto the high-voltage contact 
dome for permanent attachment.

Remote and COP versions
The ignition coil’s compact dimensions 
make it possible to implement the design 
shown in Figure 12. This version is called 
COP (Coil On Plug). The ignition coil is 
mounted directly on the spark plug, 
thereby rendering additional high-voltage 
connecting cables superfluous. This re-
duces the capacitive load on the ignition 
coil’s secondary circuit. The reduction in 
the number of components also increases 
operational reliability (no rodent bites in 
ignition cables, etc.).

In the less common remote version,  
the compact coils are mounted within the 
engine compartment using screws. Attach-
ment lugs or an additional bracket are pro-
vided for this purpose. The high-voltage 
connection is effected by means of a high-
voltage ignition cable from the ignition coil 
to the spark plug.

The COP and remote versions are 
 virtually identical in design. However,  
the remote version (mounted on the vehi-
cle body) is subject to fewer demands with  
regard to temperature and vibration con-
ditions due to the fact that it is exposed to 
fewer loads and strains.

Pencil coil
The pencil coil makes optimal use of the 
space available within the engine compart-
ment. Its cylindrical shape makes it possi-
ble to use the spark plug well as a supple-
mentary installation area for ideal space 
utilization on the cylinder head.

Because pencil coils are always mounted 

directly on the spark plug, no additional 
high-voltage connecting cables are re-
quired.

13 Design of pencil coil

Control of gasoline engines     Ignition coils                            171

Design and magnetic circuit
Pencil coils operate like compact coils in 
accordance with the inductive principle. 
However, the rotational symmetry results 
in a design structure that differs consider-
ably from that of compact coils. 

Although the magnetic circuit consists 
of the same materials, the central rod core 
(Fig. 13, Item 5) consists of laminations in 
various widths stacked in packs that are 
virtually circular. The yoke plate (9) that 
provides the magnetic circuit is a rolled 
and slotted sleeve – also in electrical sheet 
steel, sometimes in multiple layers.

Another difference relative to compact 
coils is the primary winding (7), which has 
a larger diameter and is above the second-
ary winding (6), while the body of the 
winding also supports the rod core.  
This arrangement brings significant bene-
fits in the areas of design and operation.
Owing to restrictions imposed by their 
geometrical configuration and compact di-
mensions, pencil coils allow only limited 
scope for varying the magnetic circuit  
(rod core, yoke plate) and windings. 

In most pencil-coil applications, the lim-

ited space available dictates that perma-
nent magnets be used to increase the 
spark energy. 

The arrangements for electrical contact 
with the spark plug and for connection to 
the engine wiring harness are comparable 
with those used for compact pencil coils.

   Control of Diesel engines    System overview

Control of Diesel engines

System overview
Electronic control of a diesel engine en-
ables precise and differentiated modula-
tion of fuel-injection parameters. This is 
the only means by which a modern diesel 
engine is able to satisfy the many demands 
placed upon it. Electronic diesel control 
(EDC) is subdivided into three system 
blocks: sensors/setpoint generators, ECU, 
and actuators.

Requirements
The lowering of fuel consumption and ex-
haust emissions (NOX, CO, HC, particulates) 
combined with simultaneous improvement 
of engine power output and torque are the 
guiding principles of current development 
work on diesel-engine design. Conventional 
indirect-injection engines (IDI) were no 
longer able to satisfy these requirements. 
State-of-the-art technology is repre-
sented today by direct-injection diesel en-
gines (DI) with high injection pressures for 
efficient mixture formation. The fuel-injec-
tion systems support several injection pro-
cesses: pre-injection, main injection, and 
secondary injection. These injection pro-
cesses are for the most part controlled 
electronically (pre-injection, however, is 
controlled mechanically on UIS for cars).

In addition, diesel-engine development

manded in modern cars. Exhaust and 
noise emissions are also subject to ever 
more stringent demands.

As a result, the performance demanded 
of the fuel-injection and management sys-
tems has also increased, specifically with 
regard to:
 • High injection pressures
 • Rate shaping
 • Pre-injection and, if necessary, second-

ary injection

 • Adaptation of injected fuel quantity, 
boost pressure and start of injection  
at the respective operating status
 • Temperature-dependent excess-fuel 

quantity

 • Load-independent idle speed control
 • Controlled exhaust-gas recirculation
 • Cruise control
 • Tight tolerances for start of injection and 
injected-fuel quantity and maintenance 
of high precision over the service life of 
the system (long-term performance)

 • Support of exhaust-gas treatment

Control of Diesel engines     System overview                             173

Conventional mechanical RPM control 
uses a number of adjusting mechanisms  
to adapt to different engine operating sta-
tuses and ensures high-quality mixture 
formation. Nevertheless, it is restricted to 
a simple engine-based control loop and 
there are a number of important influenc-
ing variables that it cannot take account of 
or cannot respond quickly enough to.

As demands have increased, EDC has de-

veloped into a complex electronic engine-
management system capable of processing 
large amounts of data in real time. In addi-
tion to its pure engine-management func-
tion, EDC supports a series of comfort and 
convenience functions (e.g. cruise control). 
It can form part of an overall electronic ve-
hicle-speed control system (“drive-by-
wire”). And as a result of the  increasing in-
tegration of electronic components, com-
plex electronics can be accommodated in a 
very small space.

Operating principle
Electronic diesel control (EDC) is capable 
of meeting the requirements listed above 
as a result of microcontroller performance 
that has improved considerably in the last 
few years. 

In contrast to diesel-engine vehicles 
with conventional in-line or distributor 
 injection pumps, the driver of an EDC-
 controlled vehicle has no direct influence, 
for instance through the accelerator pedal 
and Bowden cable, upon the injected fuel 
quantity. Instead, the injected fuel quantity 
is determined by a number of influencing 
variables. These include:
 • Driver command (accelerator-pedal  

position)

 • Operating status
 • Engine temperature
 • Interventions by other systems  

(e.g. TCS)

 • Effects on exhaust emissions, etc.

The ECU calculates the injected fuel quan-
tity on the basis of all these influencing 

variables. Start of injection can also be var-
ied. This requires a comprehensive moni-
toring concept that detects inconsistencies 
and initiates appropriate actions in accor-
dance with the effects (e.g. torque limita-
tion or limp-home mode in the idle-speed 
range). EDC therefore incorporates a num-
ber of control loops.

Electronic diesel control allows data 

communication with other electronic 
 systems, such as the traction-control 
 system (TCS), electronic transmission 
 control (ETC), or electronic stability pro-
gram (ESP). As a result, the engine-man-
agement system can be integrated in the 
vehicle’s overall control system, thereby 
enabling functions such as reduction of 
engine torque when the automatic trans-
mission changes gear, regulation of engine 
torque to compensate for wheel slip, etc. 

The EDC system is fully integrated in the 

vehicle’s diagnosis system. It meets all 
OBD (On-Board Diagnosis) and EOBD  
(European OBD) requirements.

System blocks
Electronic diesel control (EDC) is divided 
into three system blocks (Fig. 1):

1. Sensors and setpoint generators detect 
operating conditions (e.g. engine speed) 
and setpoint values (e.g. switch position). 
They convert physical variables into elec-
trical signals.

2. The ECU processes the information  
from the sensors and setpoint generators 
in mathematical computing processes 
(open- and closed-loop control algo-
rithms). It controls the actuators by means 
of electrical output signals. In addition, the 
ECU acts as an interface to other systems 
and to the vehicle diagnosis system.

3. Actuators convert the electrical output 
signals from the ECU into mechanical vari-
ables (e.g. solenoid-valve needle lift).

174   

 

  Control of Diesel engines     Data processing

Data processing
The main function of the electronic diesel 
control (EDC) is to control the injected fuel 
quantity and the injection timing. The 
common-rail accumulator injection system 
also controls injection pressure. Further-
more, on all systems, the engine ECU con-
trols a number of actuators. The EDC func-
tions must be matched to every vehicle 
and every engine. This is the only way to 
optimize component interaction (Fig. 3).

The control unit evaluates the signals sent 
by the sensors and limits them to the per-
mitted voltage level. Some input signals 
are also checked for plausibility. Using this 
input data together with stored program 
maps, the microprocessor calculates the 
position and duration for injection timing. 
This information is then converted to a sig-
nal characteristic which is aligned to the 
engine’s piston strokes. This calculation 
program is termed the “ECU software”.

The required degree of accuracy together 
with the diesel engine’s outstanding dy-
namic response requires high-level com-
puting power. The output signals are  
applied to driver stages which provide  
adequate power for the actuators (for in-
stance, the high-pressure solenoid valves 
for fuel injection, exhaust-gas recircula-
tion positioner, or boost-pressure actua-
tor). Apart from this, a number of other 
auxiliary-function components (e.g. glow 
relay and air-conditioning system) are 
 triggered.

The driver-stage diagnosis functions for 
the solenoid valves also detect faulty sig-
nal characteristics. Furthermore, signals 
are exchanged with other systems in the 
vehicle via the interfaces. The engine ECU 
monitors the complete fuel-injection sys-
tem as part of a safety strategy.

  Control of Diesel engines     Fuel injection control

Fuel-injection control
Table 1 provides an overview of the EDC 
functions which are implemented in the 
various fuel-injection systems. Figure 4 
shows the sequence of fuel-injection calcu-
lations with all functions, a number of 
which are optional extras. These can be 
activated in the ECU by the after-sales ser-
vice when retrofit equipment is installed. 

In order that the engine can run with opti-
mal combustion under all operating condi-
tions, the ECU calculates exactly the right 
injected fuel quantity for all conditions. 
Here, a number of parameters must be 
taken into account. On a number of sole-
noid-valve-controlled distributor-type in-
jection pumps, the solenoid valves for in-
jected fuel quantity and start of injection 
are triggered by a separate pump ECU.

  Control of Diesel engines     Torque-controlled EDC systems

Torque-controlled EDC systems
The engine-management system is continu-
ally being integrated more closely into the 
overall vehicle system. Vehicle-dynamics 
systems (e.g. TCS), comfort and conve-
nience systems (e.g. cruise control/Tempo-
mat), and transmission control influence 
electronic diesel control (EDC) via the  
CAN bus. Apart from this, much of the in-
formation registered or calculated in the 
engine-management system must be passed 
on to other ECUs via the CAN bus.

In order to be able to incorporate EDC 
even more efficiently in a functional alli-
ance with other ECUs, and implement 
other changes rapidly and effectively,  
it was necessary to make radical changes 
to the newest-generation controls. These 
changes resulted in torque-controlled 
EDC, which was introduced with the 
EDC16. The main feature is the changeover 
of the module interfaces to the parameters 
as commonly encountered in practice in 
the vehicle.

Engine characteristics
Essentially, an engine’s output can be  
defined using the three characteristics: 
power P, engine speed n, and torque M. 
Figure 5 compares typical curves of 
torque and power as a function of the en-
gine speed of two diesel engines. Basically 
speaking, the following formula applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

It is sufficient therefore, for example, to 
specify the torque as the reference vari-
able while taking into account the engine 
speed. Engine power then results from the 
above formula. Since power output cannot 
be measured directly, torque has turned 
out to be a suitable reference variable for 
engine management.

 accelerator-pedal (sensor) to directly 
 demand a given torque from the engine.  
Independently of the driver’s require-
ments, other external vehicle systems sub-
mit torque demands via the interfaces re-
sulting from the power requirements of 
the particular component (e.g. air-condi-
tioning system, alternator). Using these 
torque-requirement inputs, the engine-
management system calculates the output 
engine torque to be generated and con-
trols the fuel-injection and air-system ac-
tuators accordingly. This has the following 
advantages:
 • No system has a direct influence on en-
gine management (boost pressure, fuel 
injection, preglow). The engine manage-
ment system can thus also take into ac-
count other higher-level optimization 
criteria for the external requirements  
(e.g. exhaust-gas emissions, fuel con-
sumption) and then control the engine 
in the best way possible.

 • Many of the functions which do not di-
rectly concern the engine management 
system can be designed to function iden-
tically for diesel and gasoline engines.
 • Expansions to the system can be imple-

mented quickly.

Sequence of engine management
The setpoint values are processed further 
in the engine ECU. In order to fulfill their 
assignments efficiently, the engine manage-
ment system’s control functions all require 
a wide range of sensor signals and informa-
tion from other ECUs in the vehicle.

Propulsion torque
The driver’s input (i.e. the signal from the 
accelerator-pedal sensor) is interpreted  
by the engine management system as the 
request for a propulsion torque. The in-
puts from the cruise control and the vehi-
cle-speed limiter are processed in exactly 
the same manner. 

Following this selection of the desired 

propulsive torque, should the situation 
arise, the vehicle-dynamics system (TCS, 
ESP) increases the desired torque value 
when there is the danger of wheel lockup 
and decreases it when the wheels show a 
tendency to spin. 

Further external torque demands
The drivetrain’s torque adaptation must be 
taken into account (drivetrain transmission 
ratio). This is defined for the most part by 
the ratio of the particular gear, or by the 
torque-converter efficiency in the case of 
automatic transmissions. On vehicles with 
an automatic transmission, the transmis-
sion control stipulates the torque demand 
during the gearshift. This is reduced in or-
der to produce a comfortable, smooth gear-
shift, thus protecting the engine. In addi-
tion, the torque required by other engine-
powered auxiliary systems (e.g. air-con- 
ditioning compressor, alternator, servo 
pump) is determined. This torque demand 
is calculated either by the auxiliary sys-
tems themselves or by the engine manage-
ment system. Calculation is based on the 
required power and engine speed, and the 
engine management system adds up the 
various torque requirements. 

The vehicle’s driveability remains un-
changed notwithstanding varying require-

ments from the auxiliary systems and 
changes in the engine’s operating states.

Internal torque demands
At this stage, the idle-speed control and 
the active surge damper intervene.

For instance, if demanded by the situa-
tion, in order to prevent mechanical dam-
age, or excessive smoke due to the injec-
tion of too much fuel, the torque limitation 
reduces the internal torque demand. In 
contrast to previous engine-management 
systems, limitations are no longer only ap-
plied to the injected fuel quantity, but in-
stead, depending on the required effects, 
also to the particular physical quantity in-
volved.

The engine’s losses are also taken into 
account (e.g. friction, drive for the high-
pressure pump). The torque represents 
the engine’s measurable effects to the out-
side. However, the engine management 
system can only generate these effects in 
conjunction with the correct fuel injection 
together with the correct injection point, 
and the necessary marginal conditions as 
apply to the air system (e.g. boost pressure 
and exhaust-gas recirculation rate). The 
required injected fuel quantity is deter-
mined using the current combustion effi-
ciency. The calculated fuel quantity is lim-
ited by a protective function (e.g. protec-
tion against overheating), and if necessary 
can be varied by smooth-running control. 
During engine start, the injected fuel quan-
tity is not determined by external inputs 
such as those from the driver, but rather 
by the separate “start quantity” control 
function.

Actuator triggering
The resulting setpoint value for the in-
jected fuel quantity is used to generate the 
triggering data for the injection pumps 
and/or the fuel injectors, and for defining 
the optimum operating point for the in-
take-air system.

  Lighting technology     Automotive light sources

Lighting technology

Automotive light sources
The most important light sources for the 
lighting systems on the vehicle front and 
rear are halogen lamps, bulbs, gas-dis-
charge lamps and LEDs.

Thermal radiators
Thermal radiators generate light from heat 
energy. The major liability of the thermal 
radiator is its low working efficiency (be-
low 10 %) which, relative to the gas-dis-
charge lamp, leads to very low potential 
for luminous efficiency.

Incandescent (vacuum) bulb
Among the thermal radiators is the bulb 
(Fig. 1) whose tungsten filament (2) is en-
closed by glass (1). A vacuum is created in-
side the glass, which is why the incandes-
cent bulb is also known as a vacuum bulb.

At 10 to 18 lm/W (lumen/Watt), the lumi-
nous efficiency of an incandescent bulb is 
comparatively low. During bulb operation, 
the tungsten particles of the filament va-
porize. The glass consequently darkens 
over the course of the bulb’s service life. 
The vaporization of the particles ulti-
mately leads to the filament breaking and 
thus failure of the lamp. For this reason, 
incandescent bulbs as light sources for  

the headlamps have been replaced by hal-
ogen lamps. For cost reasons, however, in-
candescent bulbs continue to be used for 
other lights and as light sources in the pas-
senger compartment. Even the lighting of 
passive display elements (e.g. fan, heating 
and air-conditioning controllers, LCD dis-
plays) is generally performed by incandes-
cent bulbs, the color of which is changed 
by means of color filters for the applica-
tion and design concerned.

Halogen lamp
There are two types of halogen lamp:  
with one or two tungsten filaments. The 
halogen lamps H1, H3, H7, HB3 and HB4 
(see table at the end of the chapter) only 
have one filament. They are used as light 
sources for the low-beam, high-beam and 
fog lights. 

The bulb is made of quartz glass.  
The quartz glass filters out the low UV 
content of the beam that halogen lamps 
emit. Unlike an incandescent bulb, the 
glass of a halogen lamp contains a halogen 
charge (iodine or bromine). This makes it 
possible for the filament to heat up to tem-
peratures approaching tungsten’s melting 
point (around 3,400 °C), thereby achieving 
commensurately high levels of luminous 
power.

Close to the hot bulb wall, vaporized tung-
sten particles combine with the filler gas to 
form a transparent gas (tungsten halide). 
This is stable within a temperature range 
of approximately 200 to 1,400  °C. Tung-
sten particles re-approaching the filament 
respond to the high temperatures at the 
filament by dispersing to form a consistent 
tungsten layer. This cycle (Fig. 2) limits the 
wear rate of the filament. In order to main-
tain this cycle, an external bulb tempera-
ture of approx. 300 °C is necessary. The 
glass therefore encloses the filament 
tightly. It remains clear throughout the 
 entire service life of the lamp. 

The rate of filament wear is also limited 

by the high pressure that is generated in 
the bulb, limiting the vaporization rate of 
the tungsten. 

The H4 halogen lamp generates the light 
beam in the same way but has two fila-
ments (Fig. 3, Items 2 and 3). This means 

3 H4 halogen lamp

that only one lamp is required for each 
low-beam and high-beam headlamp. 

The lower part of the low-beam filament 

is masked by a screen integrated in the 
headlamp. As a result, the light is only 
emitted into the upper part of the reflector 
(Fig. 8) and thereby prevents dazzling 
other road users.

Switching from low beam to high beam 

activates the second filament. Halogen 
lamps with an output of 60/55 W1) emit 
around twice as much light as incandes-
cent bulbs with an output of 45/40 W.  
The high luminous efficiency of around  
22 to 26 lm/W is primarily the result of  
the high filament temperature.

Gas-discharge lamps
Gas discharge describes the electrical dis-
charge that occurs when an electrical cur-
rent flows through a gas and causes it to 
emit radiation (examples: sodium-vapor 
lamps for street lighting and fluorescent 
lamps for interior lighting).

The discharge chamber of the gas-dis-
charge lamp (Fig. 4, Item 3) is filled with 
the  inert gas xenon and a mixture of metal 
 halides. The electrical voltage is applied 
between two electrodes (4) protruding  
into the bulb. An electronic ballast unit is 
required for switching on and operation. 
 Application of an ignition voltage in the  
10 to 20 kV range ionizes the gas between 
the electrodes, producing an electrically 
conductive path in the form of a luminous 
arc. With the alternating current (400 Hz) 
applied, the metallic charge is vaporized 
due to the temperature increase inside the 
bulb and light is radiated.

Under normal circumstances the lamp re-
quires several seconds to ionize all of the 
particles and generate full illumination.  
To accelerate this process, an increased 
starting current flows until this point.

When maximum luminous power is 
achieved, limitation of lamp current com-
mences. A sustained operating voltage of 
only 85 V is sufficient to maintain the arc.
Light sources relying on the gas-dis-
charge concept acquired new significance 
for automotive applications with the ad-
vent of the “Litronic” electronic lighting 
system. This concept features several cru-
cial benefits compared with conventional 
bulbs:
 • Greater range of the headlamp beam
 • Brighter and more even carriageway

The D2/D4-series automotive gas-dis-
charge lamps feature high-voltage-proof 
sockets and UV glass shielding elements. 
On the D1/D3-series models, the high-volt-
age electronics necessary for operation 
are also integrated in the lamp socket.  
All series can be broken down into two 
subcategories:
 • Standard lamp (S lamp) for projection 

 • Reflection lamp (R lamp) for reflection 
headlamps (Fig. 5). They have an inte-
grated shutter (3) to create the light-
dark cutoff, comparable with the shutter 
in the H4 lamp.

Until now, gas-discharge lamps with the 
type designations D1x and D2x were used. 
From 2007, the D3/D4-series will also be 
fitted as standard. These have a lower 
 operating voltage, a different charge gas 
composition, and different arc geometries.

Light emitting diodes
The light emitting diode (LED) is an active 
light element. If an electrical voltage is ap-
plied, current flows through the chip. The 
electrons of the atoms of the LED chip are 
highly energized by the voltage. As light is 
emitted, they return to their initial state of 
low energy charge. 

The 0.1 to 1 mm small semiconductor crys-
tal is seated on a reflector that directs the 
light with pin-point precision.

LEDs are commonly used as light 

sources for lights on the rear of the vehi-
cle, especially the additional stop lamps 
located in the center. They make it possi-
ble for a narrow, linear beam to be emitted.

By comparison with incandescent bulbs, 
LEDs are beneficial in that they emit maxi-
mum output in less than a millisecond.  
An incandescent bulb takes approximately 
200 ms. LEDs, for example, are therefore 
able to emit the brake signal sooner and 
thus shorten the response time to the 
brake signal (brake pedal depressed)  
for drivers behind.

In the motor vehicle, LEDs are used as illu-
minators or in displays, in the interior they 
are used for lighting, in displays or display 
backlighting. In the lighting system, they 
find use as auxiliary stop lamps and tail 
lamps, and, increasingly in future, as day-
time running lamps and in headlamps.

▶ Technical lighting variables

Luminous intensity
The brightness of light sources can vary. 
Luminous intensity serves as an index 
for comparing them. It is the visible light 
radiation that a light source projects in a 
specific direction. 

The unit for defining levels of luminous 
intensity is the candela (cd), roughly 
equivalent to the illumination emitted  
by one candle. The brightness of an 
 illuminated surface varies according to  
its reflective properties, the luminous  
intensity and the distance separating  
it from the light source. 

Examples of permissible values
Stop lamp (individual): 60 to 185 cd
Tail lamp (individual): 4 to 12 cd
Rear fog lamp (individual): 150 to 300 cd
High beam (total, maximum): 225,000 cd

Luminous flux
Luminous flux is that light emitted by a 
light source that falls within the visible 
wavelength range. 
Values are expressed in lumen (lm). 

Illuminance
The illuminance is the luminous flux ar-
riving at a given surface. It increases 
proportionally along with the light inten-
sity, and decreases with the square of 
the distance. 

Illuminance is expressed in lux (lx):
1 lx = 1 lm/m2

Range
The range is defined as the distance at 
which the illuminance in the light beam 
still has a given value (e.g. 1 lx). The 
geometric range is the distance at which 
the horizontal part of the light-dark cut-
off is shown on the road surface with 
the headlamps on low beam.

  Lighting technology     Main headlamps (Europe)

Main headlamps (Europe)
Function
On the one hand, the main headlamps must 
provide maximum visual range while at the 
same time ensuring that the glare effect for 
oncoming traffic is kept to a minimum and 
that light distribution immediately in front 
of the vehicle remains in line with the re-
quirements of safe operation. It is vital to 
provide the lateral illumination needed to 
safely negotiate bends, i.e. the light must 
extend outward to embrace the verge of 
the road. Although it is impossible to 
achieve absolutely consistent luminance 
across the entire road surface, it is possible 
to avoid sharp contrasts in light density.

High beam
The high beam is usually generated by a 
light source located at the reflector’s focal 
point, causing the light to be reflected out-
ward along a plane extending along the re-
flector’s axis (Fig. 7). The maximum lumi-
nous intensity which is available during 
high-beam operation is largely a function 
of the reflector’s mirrored surface area. 

In four and six-headlamp systems, in par-
ticular, purely parabolic high-beam reflec-
tors can be replaced by units with complex 
geometrical configurations for simultane-
ous use of high and low beams.

In these systems the high-beam compo-
nent is designed to join with the low beam 
(simultaneous operation) to produce a 
harmonious overall high-beam distribu-
tion pattern. This strategy abolishes the 
annoying overlapping sector that would 
otherwise be present at the front of the 
light pattern.

Low beam (dipped beam)
The high traffic density on modern roads 
severely restricts the use of high-beam 
headlamps. The low beams serve as the 
primary source of light under normal 
 conditions. Basic design modifications 
 implemented within recent years are 
 behind the substantial improvements in 
low-beam performance. Developments 
have included:
 • Introduction of the asymmetrical low-

beam pattern, characterized (RHD traf-
fic) by an extended visual range along 
the right side of the road.

 • Introduction of new headlamp systems 
featuring complex geometrical configu-
rations (PES1), free-form surfaces2), fac-
etted reflectors3)) offering efficiency-

1)  The  PES  (Poly-Ellip-

soid  System)  headlamp 

system  works  with  an 

imaging  optical  lens. 

 Unlike with conventional 

headlamps,  the  light 

pattern  generated  by 

the  reflector  is  repro-

duced  on  the  roadway 

by  the  lens  together 

with  a  screen  for  creat-

ing  the  light-dark  cut-

off. 

2)  Reflectors  with  small 

short focal length whose 

shape 

is  calculated 

 using  special  programs 

(CAL:  Computer  Aided 

Lighting).  In  this  way, 

three  separate  reflec-

tors  for  low  beam,  high 

beam  and  fog  lamp  

can  be  accommodated 

within  the  same  space 

needed  by  a  conven-

tional  parabolic  reflec-

tor, while luminous effi-

ciency  is  increased  at 

the same time.

3)  With  facetted  reflec-

tors,  the  surface 

is 

 divided  into  individually 

optimized  segments. 

This  results  in  reflector 

surfaces with high levels 

of  homogeneity  and 

sideways beam spread.

Six-headlamp systems differ from the quad 
configuration by incorporating a supple-
mentary fog lamp within the main head-
lamp assembly (Fig. 9 c).

Main headlamps (North America)
High beam
The designs for high-beam headlamps are 
the same as in Europe. Facetted reflectors 
with, for example, HB5 or H7 lamps are 
used. 

Low beam (dipped beam)
Headlamps with a light-dark cutoff that 
rely on visual/optical adjustment proce-
dures have been approved in the USA 
since 1 May, 1997. This has made it possi-
ble to equip vehicles for Europe and the 
USA with headlamps of the same type and, 
in some cases, even the same reflectors.

Regulations
The regulations for the attachment and 
wiring of main headlamps are comparable 
with the European regulations (Federal 
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 
No. 108 and SAE Ground Vehicle Lighting 
Standards Manual). 

An amendment to FMVSS 108 that en-

tered effect in 1983 made it possible to 
start using headlamp units of various 
shapes and sizes with replaceable bulbs. 
These were known as the RBH, or Replace-
able Bulb Headlamps.

Headlamp systems
North America mirrors European practice 
in employing dual, quad and six-headlamp 
systems.

of the vehicle is heavily laden. Vehicles 
must also be equipped with headlamp 
washer systems.

 • “Litronic” gas-discharge lamps supply 
more than twice as much light as con-
ventional halogen lamps.

Operating concept
Low-beam headlamps need a light-dark 
cutoff in the light pattern. In the case of  
H4 halogen headlamps and Litronic head-
lamps with D2R bulbs, this is achieved by 
the image from the shield (H4) or the shut-
ter (D2R). On headlamps for all-round use 
(H1-, H7-, HB11 bulbs), the light-dark cut-
off is achieved by the special imaging of 
the filament.

Headlamp systems
Dual-headlamp systems rely on a single 
shared reflector for low- and high-beam 
operation, e.g. in combination with a dual-
filament H4 bulb (Fig. 9 a).

In quad headlamp systems one pair of 
headlamps may be switched on in both 
modes or during low-beam operation only, 
while the other pair is operated exclu-
sively for high-beam use (Fig. 9 b).

  Lighting technology     Litronic

Litronic
Overview
The “Litronic” (Light-Electronics) head-
lamp system uses xenon gas-discharge 
lamps that produce a powerful lighting 
 effect despite the low front-end surface 
area requirement. The illumination of the 
carriageway represents a substantial im-
provement over that provided by conven-
tional halogen units (Fig. 10).

For low beam, the headlamps with xenon 
gas-discharge lamps are installed in a quad 
system that is combined with the high-
beam headlamps of the conventional 
 design. 

With the Bi-Litronic system, however, 
the low and high beams are generated by 
only one gas-discharge lamp from a dual-
headlamp system. 

The light generated contains a higher 
proportion of green and blue and is thus 
more similar to the spectral distribution of 
sunlight. Night-time driving is therefore 
less exacting for the driver.

An integral part of the headlamp is the 
electronic ballast unit responsible for 
 activating and monitoring the lamp.  
Its functions include:
 • Ignition of the gas discharge  

Design
The components of the Litronic headlamp 
system are:
 • Optical unit with xenon gas-discharge 
lamp (S lamp, R lamp; see “Gas-dis-
charge lamps” section) 

 • Electronic ballast unit with igniter and 

ECU

10 Light pattern on the road (comparison)

(voltage 10 to 20 kV)

 • Regulated power supply during the  

warm-up phase when the lamp is cold
 • Demand-oriented supply in continuous 

operation

The control units for the individual lamp 
types are generally developed for a spe-
cific design type and are not universally 
interchangeable. 

Operating principle
In the gas-discharge lamp, the arc is ig-
nited when the light is switched on. A high 
voltage of 18 to 20 kV is required for this 
to be possible. 85 V are required to main-
tain the arc after ignition. The voltage is 
generated and regulated by an electronic

Bi-Litronic “Reflection”
The “Reflection” Bi-Litronic system makes 
it possible to generate the low and high 
beams using only one gas-discharge lamp 
(DR2 lamp) from a dual-headlamp system. 
The concept relies on an electromechani-
cal positioner that responds to the high/
low-beam switch by varying the attitude  
of the gas-discharge lamp within the re-
flector. lt alternates between two different 
positions to generate separate projection 
patterns for low and high beam (Fig. 12).

This layout gives Bi-Litronic the follow-

ing major advantages:
 • Xenon light for high-beam operation
 • Visual guidance provided by the contin-

uous shift in light distribution from close 
to extended range

12 Bi-Litronic “Reflection”

ballast unit (igniter, Fig. 11). After ignition, 
the gas-discharge lamp is operated for ap-
proximately 3 secs with an elevated start-
ing current (approximately 2.6 A) so that  
it achieves maximum luminosity with mini-
mal delay. The bulb’s output in this period 
is anywhere up to 75 W. During continu-
ous-running operation, it is 35 W.

The maximum luminous efficiency of ap-
proximately 90 lm/W is achieved once the 
plasma has heated the quartz glass to ap-
proximately 900  °C. Once the gas-discharge 
lamp has achieved maximum luminosity, 
the ballast unit reduces the current output 
to the bulb to approximately 0.4 A for con-
tinuous-running operation.

Fluctuations in the vehicle system voltage 
are for the most part compensated for by 
the ballast unit to prevent luminous flux 
variations. If the bulb goes out, e.g. due  
to an extreme voltage drop (below 9 V) or 
increase (above 16.5 V) in the vehicle elec-
trical system, it is automatically reignited 
without delay. The reignition is limited  
to five attempts for safety reasons. The 
power supply is then interrupted by the 
ballast unit.

  Lighting technology     Headlamp leveling control

Bi-Litronic “Projection”
The Bi-Litronic “Projection” system is 
based on a PES Litronic headlamp. It shifts 
the position of the shutter for the light-
dark cutoff to provide xenon light for  
high-beam operation.

With lens diameters of 60 and 70 mm, 

the Bi-Litronic “Projection” is the most 
compact combined low- and high-beam 
headlamp on the market, yet it still pro-
vides superb illumination.

The essential advantages of the Bi-Litronic 
“Projection” are: 
 • Xenon light for high-beam operation
 • Most compact solution for high and  

low beams 

 • Modular system

Headlamp leveling control
Function
Without headlamp leveling control, the 
range of the headlamps would alter with a 
change in load or operating condition of 
the vehicle (constant-speed travel, station-
ary, acceleration, braking). The headlamp 
leveling control adjusts the tilt angle of the 
low beam to the tilt angle of the vehicle 
body. This results in a permanently good 
visual range with no dazzling of oncoming 
traffic under all load conditions. 

 • Substantial reduction in space require-
ments as compared to a conventional 
quad headlamp system

 • Lower costs through the use of just one 
gas-discharge bulb and one ballast unit 
per headlamp

 • Greater freedom in headlamp design 
due to the individual reflector shape.

Special design variants of the Bi-Litronic 
“Reflection” lamp involve solutions in 
which the entire reflector is moved or indi-
vidual components of the bulb cover are 
opened.

Designs
All headlamp leveling controls feature ac-
tuators that move the headlamp reflector 
(housing-type design) or headlamp unit  
up and down. Automatic systems rely on 
sensors that monitor suspension travel as 
the basis for generating proportional sig-
nals for transmission to the aiming actua-
tors. Manually operated units employ a 
switch near the driver’s seat to control the 
setting.

Automatic headlamp leveling control
Automatic headlamp-leveling control sys-
tems fall into two categories: static and dy-
namic. While static systems compensate 
for load variations in the luggage and pas-
senger compartments, dynamic systems 
also correct headlamp aim during acceler-
ation – both from standing starts and when 
underway – and when braking. 

The components of a typical headlamp-

leveling control system include (Fig. 16):
 • Sensors on the vehicle axles (Items 3 

and 6) to measure the body’s inclination 
or tilt angle.

 • An ECU (5) that uses the sensor signals 
as the basis for calculating the vehicle’s 
pitch angle. The ECU compares this data 
with the specified values and responds 
to deviations by transmitting appropri-
ate triggering signals to the headlamps’ 
servomotors.

 • Servomotors (2) to adjust the headlamps 

to the correct angle.

Static system
In addition to the signals from the suspen-
sion sensors, the static system’s control 
unit also receives a speed signal from the 
electronic speedometer. The controller 
 relies on this signal to decide whether the 
vehicle is stationary, undergoing a dy-
namic change in speed, or proceeding at a 
constant speed. Automatic systems based 
on the static concept always feature sub-
stantial response inertia, so the system 
corrects only those vehicle inclinations 
that are consistently registered over rela-
tively long periods. 

Each time the vehicle has pulled away,  
it corrects the headlamp adjustment as a 
function of the vehicle’s load. This adjust-
ment is checked again when the vehicle 
steadies into constant-speed travel and  
is then corrected if necessary. Deviations 
between the target and actual position  
are evened out by the system. 

The static system only generally re-
quires a sensor on the rear axle of the 
 vehicle. A DC motor is used as each 
 headlamp’s actuator.

  Lighting technology     Adaptive lighting systems

Dynamic system
The dynamic automatic system relies on 
two distinct operating modes to ensure 
 optimal headlamp orientation under all 
driving conditions. Supplementary capa-
bilities in speed-signal analysis over the 
static headlamp leveling control endow  
the system with the ability to differentiate 
between acceleration and braking.

With the vehicle driving at constant 
speed, the dynamic system, like the static 
system, remains in the range that features 
a high level of damping but as soon as the 
controller registers acceleration or brak-
ing, the system immediately switches to its 
dynamic mode. Faster signal processing 
and the higher servomotor adjustment 
speed allow the headlamp range to be re-
adjusted within fractions of a second. Fol-
lowing acceleration or braking, the system 
automatically reverts to operation in its 
delayed-response mode.

Due to the greater dynamics require-
ments, the dynamic system needs one sen-
sor per vehicle axle and rapid stepping 
motors to adjust the headlamps. 

Adaptive lighting systems
Adaptive frontlighting system (AFS)
From 2007, function enhancements for 
headlamp systems based on a new EC 
 control are permitted. The vehicle may 

then also have motorway lights, adverse 
weather lights and city lights. The opti-
mum light pattern for each of the functions 
is identified and automatically selected by 
the vehicle electronics in response to eval-
uation of various vehicle sensors. 

The first vehicles with AFS systems were 

registered back in mid-2006 thanks to an 
EU waiver for road traffic.

Adaptive rearlighting system (ARS)
Until now, the rear lights for vehicle pe-
rimeter lighting were equipped with single 
level switching. Depending on the type and 
design, these produced an invariable lumi-
nous intensity within the legal limit values. 
Today, a multitude of sensors are used to 
determine environmental parameters and 
light conditions (brightness, dirt, visual 
range, wet conditions, etc.). To achieve op-
timum visibility (sufficient luminous inten-
sity without excessive glare), the rear 
lights may in future vary luminous inten-
sity to suit the vehicle surrounding (Fig. 17).  
A stop lamp, for example, would be lit 
with high luminous intensity in sunlight 
and with low luminous intensities at night 
to ensure that other road users are able to 
recognize and draw the correct conclusion 
from the action of the vehicle.

Cornering lights (Europe)
The cornering lights function that has been 
approved for use in Germany since 2003 
improves visual range on corners and in 
turning situations. This is made possible by 
a variation of the horizontal illumination of 
the area in front of the vehicle. With static 
cornering lights, this is achieved by supple-
mentary reflectors being switched; with dy-
namic cornering lights, the headlamp mod-
ule is pivoted laterally (Fig. 18).

During the control process, the light mod-
ule or the reflector elements are pivoted 
by a stepping motor. The pivot angle and 
pivot speed are calculated by the corner-
ing lights ECU as a function of vehicle 
speed and the steering angle. Sensors de-
tect the adjustment angle of the headlamps 
and use failsafe algorithms to prevent daz-
zling of oncoming traffic in the event of a 
system malfunction.

Electronic stability program

The electronic stability program (ESP) is  
a closed-loop system designed to improve 
driveability through programmed inter-
vention in the brake system and/or drive-
train. The integrated functionality of ABS1) 
prevents the wheels from locking when the 
brakes are applied, while TCS2) inhibits 
wheel spin during acceleration. The over-
all role of ESP is to prevent the vehicle’s 
tendency to “plow” or become unstable 
and break away to the side, provided the 
vehicle remains within its physical limits.

Braking is activated on individual 

wheels in a targeted manner, such as the 
inner rear wheel to counter understeer,  
or the outer front wheel during oversteer, 
and helps to keep the vehicle’s course sta-
ble under all driving conditions. ESP can 
also accelerate the driven wheels by spe-
cific engine-control interventions to en-
sure the stability of the vehicle. 

Using this individual control concept,  
the system has two options for steering  
the vehicle: it can brake selected wheels 
(selective braking) or accelerate the  
driven wheels.

 • achieving maximum possible conver-

gence between vehicle response in the 
limit range and its characteristics in  
the normal operating range (nominal 
 behavior).

The subordinate-level ABS and TCS con-
trollers trigger the actuators governing the 
brake hydraulics and the engine-manage-
ment system using the data generated in 
the ESP controller.

The following components register driver 
commands and the system evaluates their 
signals as the basis for defining nominal 
behavior:
 • Engine-management system (e.g. apply 

accelerator pedal)

 • Brake-pressure sensor (e.g. apply 

Antilock brake system (ABS)
The antilock brake system (ABS) detects 
incipient lock on one or more wheels and 
makes sure that the brake pressure re-
mains constant or is reduced. By so doing, 
it prevents the wheels from locking up and 
the vehicle remains steerable. 

brakes) or

 • Steering-wheel-angle sensor (turning 

the steering wheel)

At this point the driver command is de-
fined as the specified response. The coeffi-
cient of friction and the vehicle speed are 
also included in the calculation. The “mon-
itor” estimates these factors based on sig-
nals transmitted by the sensors for
 • Wheel speed
 • Lateral acceleration
 • Braking pressures and
 • Yaw velocity 

The desired vehicle response is brought 
about by generating a yaw moment acting 
on the vehicle. In order to generate the de-
sired yaw moment, the system influences 
the tire-slip rate, and thus indirectly the 
longitudinal and side forces. The system in-
fluences the tire slip by varying the desired 
specifications for slip rate, which must then 
be executed by the subordinated ABS and 
TCS controllers.

The intervention process is designed to 
maintain the handling characteristics that 
the vehicle manufacturer intended the ve-
hicle to have and to serve as the basis for 
ensuring consistently reliable control.

The vehicle dynamics controller gener-
ates the specified yaw moment by relaying 
corresponding slip-modulation commands 
to the selected wheels.

Wheel-speed sensors
The speed of rotation of the wheels is an 
important input variable for the ABS con-
trol system. Wheel-speed sensors detect 
the speed of rotation of the wheels and 
pass the electrical signals to the control 
unit. 

A car may have three or four wheel-

speed sensors depending on which version 
of the ABS system is fitted (ABS system ver-
sions). The speed signals are used to calcu-
late the degree of slip between the wheels 
and the road surface and therefore detect 
incipient lock on individual wheels.

Electronic control unit
The ECU processes the information re-
ceived from the sensors according to de-
fined mathematical procedures (control al-
gorithms). The results of these calculations 
form the basis for the triggering signals 
sent to the hydraulic modulator. 

Hydraulic modulator
The hydraulic modulator incorporates a 
series of solenoid valves that can open or 
close the hydraulic circuits between the 
master cylinder (Fig. 2, Item 1) and the 
wheel-brake cylinders (4). In addition, it 
can connect the wheel-brake cylinders to 
the return pump (6). Solenoid valves with 
two hydraulic connections and two valve 
positions are used (2/2 solenoid valves). 

196  

 

   Electronic stability program     ABS control loop

The intake valve (7) between the master 
cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinder 
controls pressure build-up, while the ex-
haust valve (8) between the wheel-brake 
cylinder and the return pump controls 
pressure release. There is one such pair  
of solenoid valves for each wheel-brake 
cylinder.

Under normal conditions, the solenoid 

valves in the hydraulic modulator are at 
the “pressure build-up” setting. That 
means the intake valve is open. The hy-
draulic modulator then forms a straight-
through connection between the master 
cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinders. 
Consequently, the brake pressure gener-
ated in the master cylinder when the 
brakes are applied is transmitted directly 
to the wheel-brake cylinders at each 
wheel. 

As the degree of brake slip increases 
due to braking on a slippery surface or 
panic braking, the risk of the wheels lock-
ing up also increases. The solenoid valves 
are then switched to the “maintain pres-

sure” setting. The connection between the 
master cylinder and the wheel-brake cyl-
inder is shut off (intake valve is closed) so 
that any increase of pressure in the master 
cylinder does not lead to an increase in 
brake pressure.

If the degree of slip of any of the wheels 

increases further despite this action, the 
pressure in the wheel-brake cylinder(s) 
concerned must be reduced. To achieve 
this, the solenoid valves are switched to 
the “pressure release” setting. The intake 
valve is still closed, and in addition, the 
 exhaust valve opens to allow the return 
pump integrated in the hydraulic modula-
tor to draw brake fluid from the brake(s) 
concerned in a controlled manner. The 
brake pressure in the wheel-brake cylin-
der is thus reduced so that wheel lock-up 
does not occur.

Controlled system
The data-processing operations performed 
by the ABS control unit are based on the 
following simplified controlled system: 
 • A non-driven wheel 
 • A quarter of the vehicle’s mass appor-

tioned to that wheel 

 • Wheel brake 

 • An idealized coefficient of friction slip 

curve (substitute for the friction pairing 
of tire and road) 

That curve is divided into a stable zone 
with a linear gradient and an unstable 
zone with a constant progression (µHFmax). 
As an additional simplification, there is 
also an assumed initial straight-line brak-
ing response that is equivalent to a panic-
braking reaction.

Figure 4 shows the relationships between 
brake torque MB (the torque that can be 
generated by the brake through the tire), 
or road frictional torque MR (torque that 
acts against the wheel through the friction 
pairing of tire and road surface), and time t, 
as well as the relationships between the 
wheel deceleration (–a) and time t, 
whereby the brake torque increases in lin-
ear fashion over time. The road frictional 
torque lags slightly behind the brake 
torque by the time delay T, as long as the 
braking sequence is within the stable zone

of the curve for coefficient of friction ver-
sus brake slip. After about 130 ms, the 
maximum level (µHFmax) – and therefore the 
unstable zone – of the curve for coefficient 
of friction versus brake slip is reached. 
From that point on, the curve for coeffi-
cient of friction versus brake slip states 
that while the brake torque MB, continues 
to rise at an undiminished rate, the road 
frictional torque MR, cannot increase any 
further and remains constant. In the pe-
riod between 130 and 240 ms (this is when 
the wheel locks up), the minimal torque 
difference MB – MR, that was present in  
the stable zone rises rapidly to a high fig-
ure. That torque difference is a precise 
measure of the wheel deceleration (–a) of 
the braked wheel (Fig. 4, bottom). In the 
stable zone, the wheel deceleration is lim-
ited to a small rate, whereas in the unsta-
ble zone it increases rapidly, according to 
the amount. As a consequence, the curve 
for coefficient of friction versus wheel slip 
reveals opposite characteristics in the sta-
ble and unstable zones. The ABS exploits 
these opposing characteristics. 

Controlled variables
An essential factor in determining the ef-
fectiveness of an ABS control system is the 
choice of controlled variables. The basis 
for that choice is the wheel-speed sensor 
signals from which the ECU calculates the 
deceleration/acceleration of the wheel, 
brake slip, the reference speed and the ve-
hicle deceleration. On their own, neither 
the wheel deceleration/acceleration nor 
the brake slip are suitable as controlled 
variables because, under braking, a driven 
wheel behaves entirely differently to a 
non-driven wheel. However, by combining 
those variables on the basis of appropriate 
logical relationships, good results can be 
obtained.

speed under ideal braking conditions (op-
timum degree of brake slip). So that speed 
can be determined, the wheel-speed sen-
sors continuously transmit signals to the 
ECU for calculating the speed of the wheels. 
The ECU takes the signals from a pair of 
diagonally opposed wheels (e.g. right front 
and left rear) and calculates the reference 
speed from them. Under partial braking, 
the faster of the two diagonally opposite 
wheels generally determines the reference 
speed. If the ABS cuts in under emergency 
braking, the wheel speeds will be different 
from the vehicle speed and can thus not be 
used for calculating the reference speed 
without adjustment. During the ABS con-
trol sequence, the ECU provides the refer-
ence speed based on the speed at the start 
of the control sequence and reduces it at a 
linear rate. The gradient of the reference-
speed graph is determined by analyzing 
logical signals and relationships.

If, in addition to the wheel acceleration/
deceleration and the brake slip, the vehicle 
deceleration is brought into the equation as 
an additional quantity, and if the logical cir-
cuit in the ECU is modulated by computa-
tion results, then ideal brake control can be 
achieved. This concept has been realized in 
the Bosch antilock brake system (ABS).

Traction-control system (TCS)
The antilock brake system (ABS) prevents 
the wheel lock when the brakes are ap-
plied by lowering the wheel brake pres-
sures. The traction-control system (TCS) 
prevents wheel spin by reducing the drive 
torque at each driven wheel. 

In addition to this safety-relevant task  
of ensuring the stability and steerability  
of the vehicle when accelerating, TCS also 
improves the traction of the vehicle by 
regulating the optimum slip. The upper 
limit here is, of course, set by the traction 
requirement stipulated by the driver.

As brake slip is not directly measurable, 
the ECU calculates a quantity that approxi-
mates to it. The basis for the calculation is 
the reference speed, which represents the 

The TCS regulates the slip of the driven 
wheels as quickly as possible to the opti-
mum level. To do this the system first de-

Electronic stability program     Traction-control system (TCS)                                  199

termines a setpoint value for the slip. This 
value depends on a number of factors that 
represent the current driving situation. 
These factors include:
 • The basic characteristic for TCS refer-

ence slip (based on the slip requirement 
of a tire during acceleration)
 • Effective coefficient of friction
 • External tractive resistance (deep snow, 

Both these parameters are therefore cor-
recting variables of the TCS which can be 
used to regulate the slip at each wheel to 
the reference slip level. 

In gasoline-engine vehicles, the drive 
torque MKar can be controlled using the 
following engine-control interventions:
 • Throttle valve (throttle valve

 adjustment)

 • Yaw velocity, lateral acceleration, and 

 • Ignition system (ignition-timing

 advance)

 • Fuel-injection system (phasing  
out individual injection pulses)

In diesel-engine vehicles, the drive torque 
MKar is influenced by the electronic diesel 
control system (EDC) (reduction in the in-
jected fuel quantity).

The brake torque MBr can be regulated for 
each wheel via the brake system. The TCS 
function requires the original ABS hydrau-
lic system to be expanded because of the 
need for active pressure build-up. 

TCS interventions
The measured wheel speeds and the respec-
tive drive slip can be influenced by changing 
the torque balance Mtot at each drive wheel. 
The torque balance Mtot at each driven wheel 
results from the drive torque MKar/2  
at this wheel, the respective brake torque 
MBr and the road torque MStr (Fig. 5).

Mtot = MKar /2 + MBr + MStr
(MBr and MStr are negative here.)

This balance can obviously by influenced 
by the drive torque MKar provided by the 
engine as well as by the brake torque MBr.

  Adaptive cruise control     System description

Adaptive cruise control

System description
Like the basic cruise-control system that 
has been available as a standard feature 
for many years, ACC (Adaptive Cruise Con-
trol) can be categorized as a driver-assis-
tance system. Cruise control regulates 
driving speed to maintain the desired 
speed selected by the driver using the 
cruise-control unit. In addition to the basic 
cruise-control function, ACC measures the 
distance to the vehicle in front and its rela-
tive speed, and uses this information to-
gether with other collected data (position 
of other vehicles in the same or different 
lane; in future, even stationary objects) to 
regulate the time gap between the vehi-
cles. ACC is thus able to adapt the vehicle’s 
speed to match the speed of the vehicle 
traveling in front and maintain a safe dis-
tance from it. The driver is able to override 
or switch off the ACC function at any time 
(e.g. by depressing the gas or brake pedal).

Distance sensor
In the main, ACC systems currently have a 
radar sensor (Fig. 1, Item 1) that operates  
in a frequency range of between 76 and 
77 GHz and emits four radar lobes. Once 
 activated, ACC detects a range of up to ap-
proximately 200 m in front of the vehicle. 

The radar beams reflected by vehicles in 
front are analyzed for timing, Doppler shift 
and amplitude ratio. These factors are used 
to calculate distance, relative speed and an-
gle position relative to vehicles in front.

Network architecture
The ACC function cannot be represented 
independently as a stand-alone system; 
various subsystems (engine-management 
system, electronic stability program, trans-
mission control, instrument cluster) must 
be networked with each other. The evalua-
tion and control electronics (control unit) 
of the ACC are integrated in the sensor 
housing. They receive and send data on a 
CAN data bus from and to other electronic 
control units.

Course setting 
To ensure reliable ACC operation no mat-
ter what the situation – e.g. also on bends – 
it is essential that the preceding vehicles 
can be allocated to the correct lane(s).  
For this purpose, the information from the 
ESP sensor system (yaw rate, steering an-
gle, wheel speeds and lateral acceleration) 
is evaluated with regard to the ACC-
equipped vehicle’s own curve status.

Setting options
The driver inputs the desired speed and 
the desired time gap; the time gap avail-
able to the driver usually ranges from 1 to 
2 s. The time gap to the vehicle in front is 
calculated from the radar signals and com-
pared with the desired time gap specified 
by the driver. If this value is shorter than 
the desired value, the ACC system responds 
in a manner appropriate to the traffic situ-
ation by initially reducing engine torque, 
and only if necessary by automatically 
braking the vehicle. If the desired time gap 
is exceeded, the vehicle accelerates until 
either the speed of the vehicle in front or 
the desired speed set by the driver is 
reached. 

Engine-control intervention
Speed control requires an electronic en-
gine-performance control system. The ME 
or DI Motronic engine-management sys-
tem and the electronic diesel control (EDC) 
are integrated with this function. This sys-
tem allows the vehicle to be accelerated to 
the desired speed or, if an obstacle appears, 
to be decelerated by means of automatic 
throttle closing.

Brake intervention
If the rate of deceleration achieved by eas-
ing off the gas is not sufficient, the vehicle 
will have to be braked. The electronic sta-
bility program (ESP) is required here as it 
is able to initiate the brake intervention. 
Due to the design of ACC as a comfort 
system, the braking deceleration calcu-
lated by the ACC controller is limited to 
approximately 2 to 3 m/s2 with current 
ACC systems. If this is not sufficient for the 
current traffic situation (e.g. if the vehicle 
in front brakes sharply), the vehicle audi-
bly requests the driver to take over re-
sponsibility for braking. The necessary 
braking deceleration is then to be achieved 
using the service brake. Safety functions, 
such as panic braking, are not part of the 
ACC system.

The other stabilizing systems of ABS, 
TCS or ESP may be active as normal during 
an active ACC control intervention as nec-
essary. Depending on the parameter set-
tings of ACC, stabilization interventions 
may result in ACC being deactivated.

  Adaptive cruise control     System description

Object detection and lane allocation
The central task of the radar sensor and its 
integrated electronics is to detect objects 
and allocate them either to the same lane 
as the one on which the vehicle is travel-
ing, or to a different lane. Firstly, lane allo-
cation demands the precise detection of 
vehicles in front (high angle resolution and 
accuracy), and secondly, a precise know-
ledge of the motion of the system’s own 
 vehicle. Vehicle motion is calculated from 
the signals sent by sensors also used for 
the electronic stability program (ESP) 
(course prediction). These include the 
wheel-speed sensors and driving-dynam-
ics sensors for the yaw rate and lateral 
 acceleration. Optionally, information sup-
plied by a steering-angle sensor may also 
be processed. The decision as to which of 
the detected objects is used as the refer-
ence for adaptive cruise control is essen-
tially based on a comparison between the 
positions and motion of the detected ob-
jects and the motion of the system’s own 
vehicle. 

Adjustment 
The radar sensor is fitted at the front end 
of the vehicle. Its radar lobes are aligned 
relative to the vehicle longitudinal axis. 
This is done using adjusting screws at the 
fastening part of the sensor. If it is moved 
out of alignment by physical force, e.g. 
 deformation of the mounting due to acci-
dent damage or any other effect, realign-
ment must be carried out. Small degrees  
of misalignment are automatically cor-
rected by the permanently active align-
ment routines implemented in the soft-
ware. If manual realignment is required, 
this is indicated to the driver.    

Control and display
Controls include switches, push-buttons or 
thumbwheels for 
 • Activating the function and 
 • Setting the desired speed and 
 • Desired time gap 

The following information may be displayed 
to the driver in the instrument cluster:
 • Desired speed
 • Information on the activation status
 • The time gap selected by the driver
 • Indication of the follow-up mode, which 
informs the driver as to whether the sys-
tem is controlling the distance to a de-
tected target object or not

System limits
ACC does not yet permit control opera-
tions in city environments. This system  
can only be activated at speeds in excess  
of 30 km/h. 

Control algorithms
The control system basically consists of 
three control modules:
 • Control module 1: cruise control  

If the radar sensor has not detected any 
vehicles in front, the system maintains 
the desired speed set by the driver.
 • Control module 2: follow-up control 

The radar sensor has detected vehicles 
in front. Control essentially maintains 
the time gap to the nearest vehicle at a 
constant setting. 

 • Control module 3: control when cornering 
When negotiating tight bends, the radar 
sensor can “lose sight” of the vehicle in 
front because of the limited width of its 
“field of vision”. Until the vehicle comes 
in sight of the radar again, or until the 
system is switched to normal cruise 
 control, special measures come into 
 effect. Depending on the manufacturer, 
the speed would then be maintained,  
the current rate of lateral acceleration 
adapted or the ACC function deactivated, 
for example.

Fig. 3). The signal reflected off a vehicle  
in front is delayed in accordance with the 
signal propagation time (fe, dashed line in 
Fig. 3). In the rising ramp, the frequency is 
lower; in the falling ramp, the frequency is 
higher by the same amount. The difference 
in frequency Df is a direct measure for the 
distance.

If there is additionally a relative speed 

between the vehicles, the receive fre-
quency fe is increased (fe', dotted line in 
Fig. 3) by a specific amount Dfd in both the 
rising and falling ramp due to the Doppler 
effect. This produces two different fre-
quency differences Df1 and Df2. Their addi-
tion produces the distance between the ve-
hicles, and their subtraction the relative 
speed of the vehicles.

The signal processing in the frequency 
range therefore delivers a frequency for 
each object that as a linear combination 
produces a term for distance and relative 
speed. From the measured frequencies of 
two ramps with a different gradient, it is 
possible to determine the distance to and 
the relative speed of an object. For situa-
tions involving several targets, several 
ramps with a different gradient are re-
quired.

Ranging radar
The radar (RAdiation Detecting And Rang-
ing) transceiver unit transmits packets of 
 electromagnetic waves using an antenna. 
These reflect off an object made of electri-
cally conductive materials (e.g. vehicle 
body) and are then received. The signals 
received in this manner are “compared” 
with the transmitted signals with respect 
to their propagation time and/or fre-
quency. 

Measuring principles
Propagation time measurement
For all radar methods, the distance mea-
surement is based on the direct or indirect 
propagation time measurement for the 
time between when the radar signal is 
transmitted and when the signal echo is 
received. The direct propagation time 
measurement is used to measure period t. 
With direct reflection, this is equal to twice 
the distance d to the reflector divided by 
the speed of light c:

t = 2d/c

τ ≈ 1 µs.

For a distance of d = 150 m and 
c ≈ 300,000 km/s, the propagation time is

Frequency modulation
Direct propagation time measurement re-
quires much effort; an indirect propaga-
tion time measurement is simpler. The 
method is known as FMCW (Frequency 
Modulated Continuous Wave). Rather than 
comparing the times between the trans-
mitted signal and received echo, the 
FMCW radar compares the frequencies of 
the transmitted signal and received echo. 
The prerequisite for a meaningful mea-
surement is a modulated transmit fre-
quency. 

With the FMCW method, radar waves 
linearly modulated in their frequency are 
transmitted for a duration of typically a 
few milliseconds and in a cycle of a few 
hundred MHz (fs, continuous curve in

Doppler effect
Although the relative speed of the other 
vehicle can be measured using a number 
of subsequent distance measurements,  
it is calculated more quickly, more reliably 
and more accurately when the Doppler ef-
fect is utilized in the measurement.

For an object moving relative to the radar 
sensor with a relative speed (relative speed 
vrel), the signal echo undergoes a frequency 
shift fD compared to the emitted signal.  
At the relevant differential speeds, this is 
represented as:
fD = 22fC ? vrel/c 

fC is the carrier frequency of the signal.  
At the radar frequencies commonly used 
for ACC, fC = 76.5 GHz, there is a frequency 
shift of fD ≈ 2510 ? vrel/m, and thus 510 Hz 
at a relative speed of 21 m/s (approaching).

Angle measurement
The third basic dimension which is needed 
is the side offset (angle) of the preceding 
vehicle. The only way this can be mea-
sured is by radiating the radar beam in a 
number of different directions. The (re-
flected) signals are then applied to deter-
mine from which direction the strongest 
reflection came. This method needs either 
high-speed back-and-forth movement of

the beam (scanning), or the installation of 
a multi-beam antenna array.
 
High-frequency part of the ACC sensor
The high-frequency part can be broken 
down into four functional groups.

HF generation
The HF generation and control section 
makes the high frequency available for 
transmission (Fig. 4). The HF output of 
 between 76 and 77 GHz is generated using 
a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) com-
prising a Gunn diode in a mechanical reso-
nator. A small part of the output generated 
is downmixed into an intermediate fre-
quency band using a dielectrical reso-
nance oscillator (DRO) with harmonic 
mixer and supplied to the control elec-
tronics (PLL-ASIC, PLL = Phase Locked 
Loop). The latter controls the VCO by 
means of an output driver and provides 
frequency stabilization and modulation. 

Transmission and reception circuit
In the transmission and reception circuit, 
the HF output is divided between four 
transmission/reception channels by three 
Wilkinson splitters. Using bandpass mix-
ers, this output is supplied to the antenna 
while the return signal is downmixed to 
the basic band.

Amplification
Signals in the basic band are amplified in 
an ASIC. It has four channels, switching 
amplification, and a special characteristic 
curve. To some extent, this compensates 
for the large signal dynamics in that high 
frequencies (correspondingly high dis-
tances) are more strongly amplified. In ad-
dition, the characteristic is integrated with 
a low-pass anti-aliasing filter for subse-
quent scanning.

Antenna system
The antenna system is a monostatic sys-
tem. It comprises four combined transmit-
ter and receiver patches on the HF sub-
strate, four polyrods (plastic cones) for 
prefocusing and a plastic lens for beam 
concentration. As part of the housing, the 
lens also acts as a radar-optical window 
and shield. The radar waves are emitted 
 simultaneously and coherently by the  
four antenna patches to produce a single 
transmission wave. The beams are only 
 actually split into four separate beams on 
the receiver side. Four separate receiver 
channels are used here.

The transmit frequency is modulated  
by the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 
in a linearly ramped fashion (Fig. 3) with a 
gradient of m = df/dt. While the received 
signal returns after the propagation  
time t = 2d/c the transmit frequency has 
changed in the meantime by the differen-
tial frequency fD = t ? m. Therefore, the 
propagation time, and thus the distance, 
can be measured  indirectly by ascertaining 
the differential frequency between the 
transmitted and received signals. The 
 differential frequency, in turn, can be as-
certained using a mixer, followed by low-
pass filtering. To determine the frequency, 
the signal is digitized and converted into  
a frequency spectrum using an FFT (Fast 
Fourier Transformation). 

However, the information about the dif-
ference frequency does not only contain 
information for the propagation time but 
also for the Doppler shift. This situation 
means that there is at first a certain ambi-
guity in the evaluation. It can be resolved 
by applying multiple FMCW modulation 
cycles with different gradients.

To determine the angle at which the radar 
locates an object, multiple radar lobes are 
transmitted and evaluated. At least two 
overlapping radar beams are required to 
measure the angle. No conclusions on the 
angle of sight can be drawn from the rela-
tionships between the amplitudes that are 
measured for an object in adjacent beams. 
If, for example, four radar beams are used, 
the horizontal angular dependence of 
which is shown in Figure 5 in the form of a 
two-way antenna diagram as an example,  
it is possible to determine the horizontal 
angle of sight by comparing amplitude and 
phase of the measured radar signals using 
the antenna diagram.

CAN, lens heating to prevent icing).  
In addition, a watchdog is also integrated. 
Using a temperature sensor, it is possible 
to measure the internal temperature of  
the system.

The unit is connected to the vehicle by 

an eight-pin connector. The connector 
supplies battery voltage (approximately  
12 V), ground (GND), two CAN buses,  
or  alternatively a wakeup or K line,  
or a radome heater, or a time gap signal.
The low-frequency circuit can be de-

signed using standard printed-circuit 
board technology. Figure 7 provides a  
look inside the unit.

Radar signal processing
The low-frequency part of the FMCW ra-
dar comprises several components (Fig. 6).
A dual-core processor is used for digital 
data processing. The digital signal proces-
sor (DSP) contained in this module is used 
for data acquisition, calculating the fast 
fourier transform (FFT) and for other basic 
signal processing. The processor also con-
tains a microcontroller in which additional 
signal processing, the application software 
and control unit functions are executed. 
Furthermore, various peripherals are inte-
grated in the dual processor: serial inter-
faces, two CAN controllers (Controller 
Area Network), an analog/digital converter 
and various digital ports.

The processor is surrounded by various 
peripheral modules. The analog radar sig-
nals from the HF PCB are converted into 
digital sample values in an analog/digital 
converter (ADC). This takes place simulta-
neously for four channels. A digital low-
pass filter is also integrated in this module 
to ensure limitation to the Nyquist band-
width. An EEPROM is used as an external, 
non-volatile memory. Application para-
meters and, if applicable, fault codes are 
stored here. A multifunction ASIC is used 
to generate the supply voltages (different 
DC voltages) and as an output driver (K line,

Occupant-protection systems

In the event of an accident, occupant-pro-
tection systems are intended to keep the 
accelerations and forces that act on the 
passengers low and lessen the conse-
quences of the accident. These passive 
 vehicle safety systems include:
 • Seat belts with seat-belt pretensioners
 • Airbags and
 • Rollover protection systems  

(on  cabriolets)

Seat belts and seat-belt pretensioners pro-
vide the greater part of the protective ef-
fect since they absorb 50 to 60 % of impact 
energy. With front airbags, the energy ab-
sorption is about 70 % if deployment tim-
ing is properly synchronized.

In order to achieve optimum protection, 
the response of all components of the com-
plete occupant-protection system must be 
adapted to one another.

Seat belts and seat-belt pretensioners
Function
The function of seat belts is to restrain  
the occupants of a vehicle in their seats 
when the vehicle impacts against an obsta-
cle. In the event of a frontal impact, seat-
belt pretensioners pull the seat belts 
tighter against the body and hold the up-
per body as closely as possible against the 
seat backrest. This prevents unimpeded 
forward displacement of the occupants 
caused by inertia. Seat-belt pretensioners 
thus improve the restraining characteris-
tics of a three-point inertia-reel belt and 
increase protection against injury.

Operating principle
In an impact, the shoulder-belt tightener 
eliminates the seat belt slack and the “film-
reel effect” by rolling up and tightening 
the belt webbing. On activation, the system 
electrically fires a pyrotechnic propellant 
charge. The rising pressure acts on a piston,

which turns the belt reel via a steel  cable 
in such a way that the belt is held tightly 
against the body (Fig. 2).

Variants
In addition to the shoulder-belt tighteners, 
there are variants which pull the seat-belt 
buckle back (buckle tighteners) and simul-
taneously tighten the shoulder and lap 
belts. Buckle tighteners further improve 
the restraining effect and the protection to 
prevent occupants from sliding forward 
under the lap belt (“submarining effect”). 
A further improvement is achieved by 
the use of belt-force limiters. In this case, 
the seat belt tighteners initially tighten 
fully (using the maximum force of approx. 
4 kN, for example) and restrain the occu-
pants. If a certain belt tension is exceeded, 
the belt gives thereby extending the de-
gree of forward movement. The kinetic en-
ergy is converted into deformation energy, 
which prevents the occurrence of acceler-

ation peaks. Deformation elements include 
a torsion rod in the inertia reel shaft. 
 However, there is also an electronically 
controlled single-stage belt-force limiter, 
which reduces the belt tension to 1 to 2 kN 
by firing a detonator a specific period after 
deployment of the second front airbag 
stage and after a specific extent of forward 
movement is reached.

Front airbag
Function
The function of front airbags is to protect 
the driver and front passenger against 
head and chest injuries in a vehicle impact 
with an obstacle. In a serious accident,  
a seat-belt pretensioner cannot keep the 
head from striking the steering wheel. 

Operating principle
To protect driver and front passenger, py-
rotechnical gas inflators inflate the driver 
and passenger airbags highly dynamically 
after a vehicle impact detected by sensors. 
In order to provide maximum protection, 
the airbag must be fully inflated before  
the occupant plunges into it. Once the 
 occupant makes contact with it, the airbag 
partly deflates in order to “gently” absorb 
impact energy acting on the occupant with 
noncritical (in terms of injury) surface 
pressures and declaration forces. 

The maximum permissible forward dis-
placement of the driver before the airbag 
on the driver’s side has inflated is approxi-
mately 12.5 cm. This equates to a time of 
approximately 40 ms from the start of im-
pact (in the case of an impact with a hard 
obstacle at 50 km/h). 10 ms elapse before 
the electronics detect the impact and trig-
ger the electronic ignition system. A fur-
ther 30 ms is required for the airbag to 
 inflate. The airbag is deflated through the 
outlet openings after another 80 to 100 ms. 
The entire process takes little more than a 
tenth of a second.

Impact detection
The deceleration arising from the impact  
is detected by one (or two) longitudinal 
 acceleration sensor(s) and the change in 
speed is calculated from it. In order to be 
able to better detect oblique and offset im-
pacts, the deployment algorithm can also 
evaluate the signal from the lateral accel-
eration sensor.

The impact must also be analyzed in 
 addition to the crash sensing. The airbag 
should not trigger from a hammer blow in 
the workshop, gentle impacts, bottoming 
out, driving over curbstones or potholes. 
With this goal in mind, the sensor signals 
are processed in digital analysis algo-
rithms whose sensitivity parameters have 
been optimized with the aid of crash data 
simulations. Depending on the vehicle 
manufacturer’s production concept, the 
deployment parameters and the vehicle’s 
equipment level can also be programmed 
into the ECU at the end of the assembly 
line (“end-of-line programming”).

In order to prevent airbag-related injuries 
to “out-of-position” occupants (e.g. lean-
ing too far forward) or to small children  
in reboard (rearward-facing) child seats,  
it is essential that the front airbags be trig-
gered and inflated in accordance with the 
particular situations. The following mea-
sures are implemented for this purpose:

Deactivation switch
This can be used to disable the passenger 
airbag. The status of the airbag function is 
indicated by lamps.

Intelligent airbag systems
The introduction of improved sensing 
functions and control options for the air-
bag inflation process, with the accompany-
ing improvement in protective effect, is in-
tended to result in a gradual reduction in 
the risk of injury. Such functional improve-
ments are:

 • Impact severity detection through fur-
ther optimization of the deployment al-
gorithm or the use of one or two upfront 
sensors (Fig. 4). The latter are accelera-
tion sensors installed in the vehicle’s 
crumple zone (e.g. on the radiator cross-
member) which facilitate early detection 
of and distinction between different 
types of impact, such as ODB (Offset 
 Deformable Barrier) crashes, pole or 
 underride impacts. They also allow an 
 assessment of the impact energy.

 • Seltbelt usage detection.
 • Occupant presence, position and weight 

detection.

detection.

 • Seat position and backrest inclination 

 • Use of front airbags with two-stage gas 
inflators or with single-stage gas infla-
tors and pyrotechnically triggered gas-
discharge valves.

 • Use of seat-belt pretensioners with oc-
cupant-weight-dependent belt-force 
limiters.

 • Through data exchange with other 

 systems, e.g. ESP (Electronic Stability 
Program), and environment sensors,  
it is possible to use information from  
the phase shortly before the impact to 
further optimize the deployment of  
the  restraints. 

Side airbag
Function
Side airbags, which inflate along the length 
of the roof lining for head protection (in-
flatable tubular systems, window bags, 
 inflatable curtains) or from the door or 
seat backrest (thorax bags, upper body 
protection) are designed to cushion the 
 occupants and protect them from injury  
in the event of a side impact.

Due to the lack of a crumple zone, and the 
minimum distance between the occupants 
and the vehicle’s side structural compo-
nents, it is particularly difficult for side 
airbags to inflate in time. For this reason, 
the time required for crash sensing and 
 activating of the side airbags is approxi-
mately 5 to 10 ms for hard side impacts. 
The inflation time of the approximately 
12 l capacity thorax bag is not permitted  
to be more than 10 ms.

These requirements can be fulfilled 
through evaluation of peripheral (at suit-
able points on the body, e.g. b-pillar or 
door), lateral (sideways) acceleration and 
pressure sensors.

Rollover protection systems
Function
In the event of an accident where the vehi-
cle rolls over, open-top vehicles such as 
convertibles lack the protecting and sup-
porting roof structure of closed-top vehi-
cles. Extendable rollover bars or the ex-
tendable head restraints provide protec-
tion against injury for occupants.

Operating principle
Current sensing concepts no longer trigger 
the system at a fixed threshold but rather 
at a threshold that conforms to a situation 
and only for the most common rollover 
 situation, i.e. about the longitudinal axis.  
The Bosch sensing concept involves a sur-
face micromechanical yaw-rate sensor and 
high-resolution acceleration sensors in  
the vehicle’s transverse and vertical axes 
(y and z axes).

The yaw-rate sensor is the main sensor, 
while the y and z-axis acceleration sensors 
are used both to check plausibility and to 
detect the type of rollover (slope, gradient, 
curb impact or “soil-trip” rollover). On 
Bosch systems, these sensors are incorpo-
rated in the airbag triggering unit.

Deployment of occupant-protection sys-
tems is adapted to the situation according 
to the type of rollover, the yaw rate and the 
lateral acceleration, i.e. systems are trig-
gered after between 30 and 3,000 ms by 
automatic selection and use of the algo-
rithm module appropriate to the type of 
rollover.

Combined ECUs for seat-belt preten-
sioners, front and side airbags and 
 rollover protection equipment
Optimum occupant protection against the 
effects of frontal, offset, oblique or pole 
impact is obtained through the precisely 
coordinated interaction of electronically 
detonated pyrotechnical front airbags and 
seat-belt pretensioners. To maximize the 
effect of both protective devices, they are 
activated with optimized time response by 
a common ECU installed in the passenger 
cell. 

The following functions are currently 
 incorporated in the central ECU, also re-
ferred to as the trigger unit:
 • Crash sensing by acceleration sensor 

and safety switch or by two acceleration 
sensors without safety switch (redun-
dant, fully electronic sensing).

 • Rollover detection by yaw rate and 

 acceleration sensors that record y and  
z axis acceleration in the low-g range 
(up to approximately 5 g).

 • Prompt activation of front airbags and 
seat-belt pretensioners in response to 
different types of impact in the vehicle 
longitudinal direction (e.g. frontal, 
oblique, offset, pole, rear-end).

 • Control of rollover protection equip-

ment.

 • For the side airbags, the ECU operates in 
conjunction with a central lateral sensor 
and two or four peripheral acceleration 
sensors. The peripheral acceleration 
sensors (PAS) transmit the triggering 
command to the central ECU via a digital 
interface. The central ECU triggers the

side airbags provided the internal lat-
eral sensor has confirmed a side impact 
by means of a plausibility check. Since 
the central plausibility confirmation ar-
rives too late in the case of impacts into 
the door or above the sill, peripheral 
pressure sensors (PPS) inside the door 
cavity are used to measure the adiabatic 
pressure changes caused by deforma-
tion of the door. This will result in rapid 
detection of door impacts. Confirma-
tion of “plausibility” is now provided by 
PAS mounted on supporting peripheral 
structural components. This is now 
 unquestionably faster than the central 
lateral-acceleration sensors.

 • Voltage transformer and energy accu-
mulator in case the supply of power 
from the vehicle battery is interrupted. 
 • Selective triggering of the seat-belt pre-
tensioners, depending on monitored 
seat-belt buckle status: firing of the 
 airbag only takes place if the belt is en-
gaged in the belt buckle. At present, 
proximity-type seat-belt buckle 
switches are used, i.e. Hall IC switches 
which detect the change in the magnetic 
field when the buckle is fastened.

 • Setting of multiple trigger thresholds for 
two-stage seat-belt pretensioners and 
two-stage front airbags depending on 
the status of belt use and seat occupa-
tion.

 • Reading of signals from the interior sen-
sors and appropriate triggering of re-
straints.

 • Watchdog (WD): airbag triggering units 
must meet high safety standards with 
 regard to false activation in non-crash 
situations and correct activation when 
needed (crashes). For this reason, ninth-
generation (AB 9) airbags launched in 
2003 incorporate three independent 
hardware watchdogs (WDs): WD1 moni-
tors the 2 MHz system eClock using a 
dedicated, independent oscillator. 
WD2 monitors the realtime processes 

(time base 500 μs) for correct and com-
plete sequence. For this reason, the 
safety controller (SCON, see Fig. 4)  
sends the microcomputer eight digital 
messages to which it must respond by 
sending eight correct replies to the 
SCON within a time window of 1 ± 0.3 ms. 
WD3 monitors the background pro-
cesses such as the built-in self-test rou-
tines of the ARM core for correct opera-
tion. The microcomputer’s response to 
the SCON in this case must be provided 
within a period of 100 ms.

 • With AB 9, sensors, analyzer modules 

and driver stages are linked by two SPIs 
(Serial Peripheral Interfaces). The sen-
sors have digital outputs and their sig-
nals can be transmitted directly via SPIs. 
Shunts therefore remain on the printed-
circuit board without effect, unlike with 
analog sinusoidal transfers, and a high 
level of functional reliability is achieved. 
Deployment is only permitted if an inde-
pendent hardware plausibility channel 
has also detected the impact and enables 
the driver stages for a limited period.
 • Diagnosis of internal and external func-

tions and of system components.

 • Storage of failure modes and durations 
with crash recorder; readout via the 
 diagnosis or CAN-bus interface.

 • Warning-lamp activation.

Acceleration sensors
Acceleration sensors for crash sensing  
can be located at the following points in 
the vehicle:
 • Directly integrated in the ECU (seat-belt 

pretensioners, front airbag)

 • At selected points on the right and left-
hand side of the vehicle on supporting 
structural parts such as seat crossmem-
bers, door sills, b and c-pillar (side air-
bag) or

 • In the deformation zone at the front  

end of the vehicle (upfront sensors for 
“intelligent airbag systems”)

These sensors are surface micromechani-
cal sensors consisting of fixed and moving 
finger structures and spring pins. Since the 
sensors only have low working capaci-
tances (approximately 1 pF), it is neces-
sary to accommodate the evaluation elec-
tronics in the same housing in the immedi-
ate proximity of the sensor element so as 
to avoid stray capacitance and other forms 
of interference.

Gas inflators
The pyrotechnical propellant charges of 
the gas inflators for generating the airbag 
inflation gas and for actuating seat-belt 
pretensioners are activated by an electri-
cal firing element. The gas inflator in ques-
tion inflates the airbag with charge gas. 
The driver airbag built in the steering-
wheel hub (volume approx. 60 l) or, as the 
case may be, the passenger airbag fitted in 
the glove compartment space (approx. 120 l) 
is inflated in approx. 30 ms from firing.

AC firing
In order to prevent inadvertent triggering 
through contact between the firing ele-
ment and the vehicle system voltage (e.g. 
faulty insulation in the wiring harness),  

the firing element is fired by alternating-
current pulses with a frequency of approx. 
80 kHz (AC firing). A small ignition capaci-
tor with a capacitance of 470 nF incorpo-
rated in the firing circuit in the firing ele-
ment plug galvanically isolates the firing 
element from the DC current. This isola-
tion from the vehicle system voltage pre-
vents inadvertent triggering, even after an 
accident when the airbag remains untrig-
gered and the occupants have to be freed 
from the deformed passenger cell by 
emergency services. It may even be neces-
sary to cut through the (permanent +) fir-
ing circuit wires in the steering column 
wiring harness and short-circuit them 
 according to positive and ground.

Passenger-compartment sensing
For passenger classification, an absolute 
weight measuring method is available with 
the iBolt (intelligent bolt). These force-
measuring iBolts (Fig. 1) secure the seat 
frame (seat link) to the sliding rail and re-
place the four mounting screws otherwise 
used. They measure the weight-dependent 
change in the gap between the bolt sleeve 
and the internal bolt with integral Hall-ele-
ment IC connected to the sliding base.

   Hybrid drives     Principle

Hybrid drives

A concept for economizing on fuel, for 
reducing CO2 and pollutant emissions, 
and at the same time for increasing driv-
ing pleasure and driving comfort is pro-
vided by hybrid electric vehicles (Hybrid 
Electric Vehicle, HEV). For drive pur-
poses these vehicles use both an inter-
nal-combustion engine and at least one 
electric motor (electrical machine). 
There are in this respect a multitude of 
HEV configurations which partly pursue 
different optimization objectives and 
which utilize to differing extents electri-
cal energy to drive the vehicle. 

Principle

There are essentially three objectives be-
ing pursued when hybrid electric drives 
(Fig. 1) are used: fuel economy, reduced 
emissions and increased torque and power 
(“driving pleasure”). Different hybrid con-
cepts are used, depending on the objective 
being pursued. A distinction is basically 
made between mild-hybrid and full-hybrid 
vehicles, depending on their ability also to 
be able to run by pure electrical means.

In a mild hybrid the internal-combustion 

engine is assisted by an electric motor, 
which delivers additional drive power and 
braking power in different operating 

states. In a full hybrid as well the internal-
combustion engine is combined with one 
(or two) electric motor(s). In additional  
to running on the internal-combustion 
 engine and being assisted by the electric 
motor, this latter type also allows for 
purely electric driving. 

Both hybrid concepts have a start/stop 
function, as is familiar from conventional 
start/stop systems. When the vehicle is 
 stationary, e.g., when stopped at traffic 
lights, the internal-combustion engine is 
switched off. The avoidance of idling 
phases helps to save fuel. An automatic 
start/stop system can, depending on the 
level of hybridization, naturally also be 
used in vehicles with conventional drives.
Both mild-hybrid and full-hybrid sys-
tems require an electric energy accumula-
tor, which powers the driving electric 
 motor. This energy accumulator is usually 
a traction battery at a comparatively high 
voltage level.

The combination of electric and combus-
tion-engine drive sources in the mild 
 hybrid and full hybrid has various advan-
tages over conventional drivetrains:

 • The electric motor offers constantly high 
torques at low rotational speeds. In this

way it ideally supplements the internal-
combustion engine, whose torque only 
starts to increase at mid-range rota-
tional speeds. The electric motor and 
 internal-combustion engine together  
are thus able to deliver a high dynamic 
response from every driving situation 
(Fig. 2). 

 • The assistance provided by the electric 
motor makes it possible to operate the 
internal-combustion engine predomi-
nantly in the range of its best efficiency 
or in ranges in which only low pollutant 
emissions occur (operating-point opti-
mization).

 • The combination with an electric motor 

facilitates if necessary the use of a 
smaller internal-combustion engine 
while retaining the same overall power 
output (power-neutral downsizing). 
 • The combination with an electric motor 

facilitates if necessary the use of a 
higher-geared transmission while 
 retaining the same levels of driving 
 performance (downspeeding). 

The hybrid systems also offer the possibil-
ity of fuel economy through the recovery 
of braking energy. Through generator op-
eration of the electric motor (or if neces-
sary by means of an additional generator), 

it is possible when braking to convert part 
of the vehicle’s kinetic energy into electri-
cal energy. The electrical energy is stored 
in the energy accumulator and can be used 
to drive the vehicle. 

Operating modes

Depending on the operating state and re-
quired torque, the internal-combustion en-
gine and the electric motor contribute to the 
drive power to different extents. The hybrid 
control system determines the torque distri-
bution between the two drives (see section 
Operating strategy). The way in which the 
internal-combustion engine, electric 
motor(s) and energy accumulator interact 
defines the different operating modes: 
 hybrid and electric driving, boosting, gener-
ator operation and recuperative braking. 

Hybrid driving
Hybrid driving refers to all those states  
in which both the internal-combustion  
engine and the electric motor generate 
drive torque (Fig. 3). When distributing the 
drive torque, the hybrid control system 
takes into account – in addition to the opti-
mization objective (fuel consumption, 
emissions) – in particular the state of 
charge of the energy accumulator.

  Hybrid drives  |  Operating modes

Purely electric driving
Purely electric driving, in which the vehi-
cle is driven over longer distances by the 
electric motor alone, is only possible with 
the full hybrid. The internal-combustion 
engine is decoupled from the electric mo-
tor for this purpose (Fig. 4). In this operat-
ing mode the vehicle can run virtually 
noiselessly and locally without emissions. 

Boosting
In boosting mode the internal-combustion 
engine and the electric motor deliver posi-
tive drive torque. Both deliver their maxi-
mum torque for the vehicle’s maximum 
propulsion torque (Fig. 6). 

Generator mode
The electric energy accumulator is 
charged in generator mode. For this pur-
pose the internal-combustion engine is 
 operated in such a way as to deliver a 
greater amount of power than is needed 
for the desired propulsion of the vehicle. 
The  excess amount of power is fed to the 
generator and converted into electrical 
 energy, which is stored in the energy 
 accumulator (Fig. 5). 

The energy accumulator is also charged 

via the generator in overrun mode 
 provided this is permitted by the battery 
state of charge.

Regenerative braking
During regenerative braking the vehicle is 
not – or not only – braked by the service 
brake’s friction torque, but instead by a 
generator braking torque of the electric 
motor. The electric motor is therefore 
 operated like a generator and converts  
the vehicle’s kinetic energy into electrical 
energy, which is stored in the energy accu-
mulator (Fig. 7). 

Regenerative braking is also known as 
recuperative braking or as recuperation. 

Start/stop function

Both mild hybrid and full hybrid have a 
start/stop function (Fig. 8). But even vehi-
cles with conventional drives can be 
equipped with a start/stop system. 

Function
When the vehicle is stopped, the engine 
ECU checks whether 
 • no gear is engaged,
 • the speed sensor of the antilock braking 

system indicates zero, 

 • the electronic battery sensor is signaling 
sufficient energy for a starting process.

When these vehicles are satisfied, the 
 engine is automatically switched off. 

8 Start/stop functionality

As soon as the clutch is actuated the 
starter receives the signal to restart the 
engine. The engine is started quickly and 
quietly and is immediately ready for oper-
ation again.

Components
In the start/stop system a reinforced 
starter (Fig. 9, no. 1) replaces the conven-
tional starter. 

The start/stop system requires an 

adapted engine management system (4), 
which has additional interfaces to the 
starter and sensors. Since the start/stop 
system is an emission-relevant system, it 
must satisfy the requirements of OBD (on-
board diagnosis), i.e., it must be monitored 
in driving mode and exhaust-gas-relevant 
faults must be stored in the ECU’s fault 
memory. 

Because of the many starting processes 

it has to manage, the battery (2) must be 
cycle-proof. It is monitored by a battery 
sensor, which before the internal-combus-
tion engine is automatically switched off 
checks the battery state of charge and sig-
nals this to the engine ECU. 

Ancillaries such as, for example, the A/C 
compressor, which are normally driven via 
the internal-combustion engine and are 
also required during the standstill phases, 
must be electrically driven or replaced by

other solutions. This also applies to the 
mild hybrid and the full hybrid, in which 
the start/stop function can be realized by 
means of the electric motor.

Fuel economy
Fuel savings of 3.5 % to 4.5 % can be 
achieved by the start/stop system in the 
New European Driving Cycle. 

Degrees of hybridization

The degree of hybridization indicates the 
extent to which distribution of the drive 
power can be varied between the internal-
combustion engine and the electric motor. 
A distinction is made between mild hybrid 
and full hybrid, depending on the degree 
of hybridization. They differ essentially in 
the power output of the electric motor or 
with regard to the amount which the elec-
tric drive contributes to the overall drive 
power. They also differ with regard to the 
energy content of the electric accumulator. 

Mild hybrid
Function 
The mild hybrid (Fig. 10) offers in addition 
to the start/stop function the possibility of 
recuperative braking (1) and of torque as-
sistance by the electric motor (2). The elec-
tric motor delivers an additional torque, 

which is added to the internal-combustion 
engine’s torque. The energy accumula-
tor (4) makes available for this purpose an 
electrical power output of normally up to 
20 kW. This output is mainly used for start-
ing and accelerating at low engine speeds. 

Purely electric driving is only possible 
when the internal-combustion engine is 
under coupled motion, since it cannot be 
decoupled from the electric motor. Such 
an operating state is useful in energy terms 
only if the drag torque of the internal-com-
bustion engine is not too great. Mild hy-
brids are therefore often combined with 
internal-combustion engines which dem-
onstrate the possibility of cylinder shutoff.

Design
The mild hybrid is realized as a parallel 
hybrid, i.e., internal-combustion engine 
and electric motor are positioned on the 
same shaft (crankshaft). 

In addition to the conventional low-volt-
age electrical system (14 V) for supplying 
the loads/consumers, a traction electrical 
system with a clearly higher voltage is 
 provided to feed the electric drive. 
For a detailed design, see section 

 Parallel hybrid.

Fuel economy
The fuel savings of a mild hybrid com-
pared with a conventional vehicle can be 
up to 15 % in the New European Driving 
Cycle (NEDC). 

Full hybrid
Function
The full hybrid (Fig. 10) can, in contrast to 
the mild hybrid, be driven over longer dis-
tances with the electric drive alone. The 
internal-combustion engine does not ro-
tate during electric driving. The voltage of 
the traction electrical system or the bat-
tery usually ranges between 200 and 
350 V.

Hybrid drives  

Degrees of hybridization

  

  223

Design
The full hybrid can be realized with a par-
allel or serial flow of energy or can be a 
combination of parallel and serial flows of 
energy. The parallel flow of energy can be 
represented by one electric drive. To real-
ize a serial flow of power, there must be 
two electric drives in the drivetrain.

In a parallel hybrid with two clutches 
(P2-HEV) an interrupting clutch is fitted 
between the internal-combustion engine 
and the electric motor. This enables the in-
ternal-combustion engine to be decoupled 
from the electric motor for purely electric 
driving. 

For a detailed design, see section 

 Parallel hybrid.

A full hybrid with combined serial and 

parallel power flows is realized by a 
power-branching system, in which the 
central transmission element is a plane-
tary-gear set. 

For a detailed design, see section Power-

branching hybrid.

Fuel economy
The fuel savings of a full hybrid can be up 
to 30 % in the New European Driving Cycle. 

Plug-in hybrid
Full hybrids can alternatively also be de-
signed as plug-in hybrids. These offer the 
possibility of charging the traction battery 
externally (e.g., from the power socket) via 
a corresponding charger. Here it is advis-
able to use a larger battery in the vehicle 
so as to be able to cover shorter distances 
by purely electrical means and to use the 
hybrid drive for longer journeys only. 

The greatest challenge currently facing 
plug-in hybrids is posed by disadvantages 
with regard to costs and weight of the 
larger battery. Furthermore the limited 
charging power of the domestic power 
sockets results in long charging times.

Series hybrid drive
The series hybrid drive (S-HEV) is char-
acterized by the series connection of the 
energy converters (electric motors and 
internal-combustion engine) (Fig. 11). The 
series arrangement requires, in addition 
to the internal-combustion engine, two 
electric motors, where one operates as a 
generator and the other as a motor. The in-
ternal-combustion engine is not connected 
to the powered axle. 

First the kinetic energy of the inter-
nal-combustion engine is converted by a 
generator (3) into electrical energy. The 
pulse-controlled inverter (5) converts the 
power output based on the driver com-
mand and supplies the second electric mo-
tor (4), which is responsible for driving the 
wheels. This means that the power output 
necessary to move the vehicle is trans-
ferred exclusively from the electric motor 
(4) to the drive shaft.

The advantage of this drivetrain ar-
rangement is that the operating point of 
the internal-combustion engine can be 
freely selected as long as the requested 
electrical energy is made available. 
 Depending on the operating strategy, the 

internal-combustion engine with its power 
output can follow the current demand or it 
can operate uniformly at the most efficient 
operating point and deliver excess energy 
to the battery. Operation at the most ef-
ficient operating point provides for par-
ticularly low pollutant emissions – with the 
exception of NOX emissions. 

It must be borne in mind that both elec-
tric motors must be of sufficient size to be 
able to consume or deliver the power of 
the internal-combustion engine. The high 
power capability of the electric motors 
also has the advantage that even marked 
vehicle decelerations can be recuperated. 
A disadvantage of this arrangement lies 
in the multiple energy conversion and the 
associated losses of efficiency. Starting out 
from the customary mid-range losses of 
the individual components, there is a total 
loss of approximately 30 %. Further disad-
vantages are high costs, component size 
and high excess weight. The use of this ar-
rangement in passenger cars is therefore 
very limited. 

The series hybrid drive is used in heavy 
commercial vehicles, such as, for example, 
diesel-electric drives in locomotives, and 
in buses which are driven in urban traffic 
with high levels of stop-and-go operation.

The series-parallel hybrid (SP-HEV) repre-
sents a special form of the series concept 
(Fig. 12). It differs from the series drive-
train arrangement in that it has a clutch 
which connects the two electric motors. 
When the clutch is open, the system be-
haves like the above-mentioned S-HEV. 
When the clutch is closed, the internal-
combustion engine can deliver its power 
directly to the powered axle, which cor-
responds to a parallel drivetrain topol-
ogy. The disadvantages of the S-HEV with 
regard to costs, space and excess weight 
remain, but the electric motors can be of 
smaller design in that the transmittable 
power in series operation does not have to 
cover the vehicle’s full drive power aimed 
for. The series operation range can be 
limited to smaller power outputs, since at 
higher speeds and power requirements 
parallel operation is to be preferred, also 
because if a better overall drive efficiency.

Parallel hybrid drive
Unlike the series and power-branching 
concepts, parallel drivetrain topologies 
require only one electric motor (Fig. 13). 
This can be operated like both a gen-
erator and a motor, and is mechanically 
connected to the internal-combustion 
engine’s crankshaft. This involves a torque 
addition, where the torques of the drives 
(internal-combustion engine and electric 
motor) can be freely varied while the ro-
tational speeds are in fixed proportion to 
each other. In addition, when the clutch is 
closed, a purely mechanical power trans-
mission from the internal-combustion en-
gine to the powered axle is possible, irre-
spective of the state of the electric motor. 
The overall efficiency is thus higher than 
in the other hybrid topologies.

Direct connection of the electric mo-
tor to the internal-combustion engine 
has however a disadvantageous effect on 
the capacity to freely select the operating 
point, since the rotational speeds of both 
assemblies is determined by the transmis-
sion ratio and the driving speed. This can 

be altered by a transmission shift, but only 
for both assemblies in the same way. When 
a range transmission is used, the rotational 
speed of the drive combination of electric 
motor and internal-combustion engine 
therefore cannot be continuously freely 
selected.

A fundamental advantage of the parallel 
hybrid is the possibility of maintaining the 
conventional drivetrain in wide ranges. 
This has a positive effect both on space 
and vehicle production, and also on the 
usual driveability and customer accep-
tance. The development and implementa-
tion expenditure of the parallel drivetrain 
topology for passenger cars is, when com-
pared with series and power-branching 
concepts, low since lower electrical power 
outputs are required and the necessary 
adaptations when converting a conven-
tional drivetrain are fewer.

The parallel hybrid drive is further subdi-
vided according to the number of clutches 
and the positioning of the electric motor. 
The most frequently encountered design 
variations are explained in the following.

Parallel hybrid with one clutch
In the parallel hybrid with only one clutch 
(P1-HEV; Fig. 13) the electric motor is rig-
idly connected to the internal-combustion 
engine’s crankshaft such that the electric 
motor cannot be operated independently 
of the engine. For this reason, during re-
generative braking, the engine must be un-
der coupled motion, i.e., the engine’s drag 
torque is lost as recuperation potential. 
Purely electric driving is indeed theoreti-
cally possible, but the engine must also be 
under coupled motion here. The resulting 
losses and noise and vibration problems 
prohibit this vehicle operation. Merely 
purely electric gliding is representable 
from a certain speed. Here the electric 
motor delivers the propulsion torque for 
maintaining the speed and the drag power 
of the engine.

226   

 

   Hybrid drives     Drive configurations

In the simplest version of the P1-HEV 
a crankshaft starter-generator is used, 
where the electric motor is only respon-
sible for starting the internal-combus-
tion engine and for supplying the vehicle 
electrical system. Thanks to an additional 
electrical accumulator and higher electric-
motor power capability, it is possible to 
design a full mild hybrid which addition-
ally facilitates support of the engine by the 
electric motor and recovery of the braking 
energy.

Parallel hybrid with two clutches
To facilitate purely electric driving and 
regenerative braking to the full extent 
(without drag losses), an additional 
clutch is required between the inter-
nal-combustion engine and the electric 
motor (Fig. 14). Based on the number of 
clutches, this topology is known as P2-
HEV. In recuperation phases or for elec-
tric driving the engine is disconnected 
from the drivetrain and switched off when 
the second clutch is opened. In this way 
the vehicle’s deceleration energy can be 
recovered without drag losses and stored 
in the battery. Recuperation is merely 
limited by the power limits of the electric 
motor. 

Even for electric driving the engine does 
not have to be under coupled motion such 
that slow creeping becomes comfortably 
possible. It is also possible to use the elec-
tric motor’s full power output for electric 
driving without power losses to place the 
engine under coupled motion. However, 
it must be possible for the engine to be 
restarted by the electric motor at any 
time, and thus some of the electric motor’s 
power capability must be reserved for this 
purpose.

The greatest challenges faced by the 
P2-HEV concept lie in accommodating 
the second clutch in the smallest space 
available and in restarting the engine from 
electric driving without compromising on 
comfort. 

Axle-split parallel hybrid (AS-HEV)
In the P1-HEV and P2-HEV the electric 
motor and internal-combustion engine are 
arranged on a common powered axle in 
front of the transmission. Both drive as-
semblies thus always operate at the same 
rotational speed. One way of eliminating 
this uniformity of speed is to split the drive 
assemblies between the two vehicle axles. 
This topology is know as axle-split hybrid 
(AS-HEV).

In the AS-HEV the internal-combustion 
engine and the electric motor are not 
directly connected to each other mechani-
cally, but instead act on different vehicle 
axles (Fig. 15). Traction-force addition is 
thus realized via the road. Regenerative 
braking and electric driving are effected 
on front-wheel-drive vehicles via the 
electric rear axle, while the unaltered con-
ventional drivetrain drives the front axle. 
When both assemblies are active as an en-
gine/motor, this gives rise to a four-wheel 
drive. The torques between front and rear 
axles can be freely varied here between 
the respective power limits. 

It becomes clear that an essential dif-
ference exists between the AS-HEV and 
the other parallel hybrids when the ve-
hicle is stationary. When the axle is sta-
tionary, the electric motor in the AS-HEV 
cannot generate electrical power. Thus 
the vehicle electrical system must be sup-
plied and air conditioning effected when 
stationary by other means. This is pos-
sible, for example, using a powerful gen-
erator on the engine. With the aid of a DC/
DC converter the generator can charge 
the high-voltage battery even when the 
vehicle is stationary and supply the high-
voltage loads/consumers.

There are various advantages to connect-
ing the electric motor to its own vehicle 
axle:

 • Package: The conventional drivetrain 

does not have to be altered.

 • The engine and electric motor can be 

run at different rotational speeds, thus 
allowing high-speed concept to be used 
for the electric motor as well.

 • High levels of efficiency are achieved in 

recuperation and electric driving.
 • There is no need for the engine to be 

started by the electric motor (but a sepa-
rate starter is required).

Disadvantageous aspects of the AS-HEV 
are:
 • A separate starter is needed for the 

 engine.

 • A configuration of the torque and speed 
ranges of the electric motor without 
transmission to the vehicle’s entire driv-
ing range is required. (Alternative: an 
additional simple transmission for the 
electric motor, e.g., 2-speed.)

 • When stationary the high-voltage bat-

tery cannot be charged (only with addi-
tional measures, e.g., DC/DC converter).
 • Supply of the 12V vehicle electrical sys-
tem when stationary must be ensured 
(e.g,. 12V generator).

 • Monitoring of driving dynamics (ESP) is 

required for both axles. 

Electric 4WD functionality
In the AS-HEV a four-wheel drive (4WD) is 
realized by the combination of a conven-
tional drive and an electrically driven axle. 
An electric final drive can also be com-
bined with any other hybrid configuration 
in order thereby to realize electric 4WD 
functionality.

Parallel hybrid with different  
transmissions
The parallel hybrid can basically be real-
ized with all transmission types, where a 
combination with particular transmissions 
produces special advantages. It is par-
ticularly worth highlighting in this respect 
the dual-clutch transmission (DCT). This 
consists of two sub-transmissions, which 
can select different gears independently 
of each other. This creates the possibility 
of connecting the electric motor to one of 
these sub-transmissions and running it in 
a different gear from the engine (Fig. 16). 
In this way it is possible to optimize the 
electric motor’s operating point in some 
ranges independently of the engine’s oper-
ating point, which opens up an additional 
efficiency potential.

Power-branching hybrid drive
Principle
The core element of the power-branching 
hybrid topology is the planetary-gear set 
(Fig. 18). In this gear set the power output 
of the internal-combustion engine is split 
into two paths. This involves a mechani-
cal path, where power can be transmitted 
directly to the wheels by gear teeth, and an 

electrical path. As well as the engine and 
output, an electric motor (Fig. 17, no. 7) 
acts on the third shaft of the planetary-
gear set. The load point of this electric 
motor serves to transfer the engine’s ro-
tational speed and load according to the 
drive requirements into wheel speed and 
output torque. 

In a planetary-gear set the rotational 
speeds of two shafts always determine the 
rotational speed of the third shaft. The 
torque ratios between the three shafts are 
similarly determined in this way. The re-
sult of this is that a transmission of power 
in the mechanical path is only possible 
where the electric motor draws power and 
converts it into electrical power. Because 
electrical power is constantly generated 
in this way, it is neither possible nor for 
efficiency reasons sensible to store this 
power in a battery. For this reason, a sec-
ond electric motor (4), which is mounted 
directly on the output shaft, is used to 
close an electrical path and directly con-
vert the arising electrical power back into 
mechanical power. Thus a drive request, 
which is made up of a wheel speed and a 
desired wheel torque, gives rise to a pre-

ferred engine speed, which is set using the 
speed of the first electric motor (7). The 
desired wheel torque is generated by the 
engine and transmitted partly via the me-
chanical path and partly via the electrical 
path to the wheels. 

As in all hybrid vehicles the battery (6) 
serves to influence specifically the drive-
train operating state. The desired wheel 
torque can with the aid of the battery re-
sult in either a higher or a lower load state. 
By using the energy stored in the battery, it 
is possible to avoid very poor engine effi-
ciency ranges, whereby the electric motor 
(4) alone provides for propulsion of the ve-
hicle and the internal-combustion engine 
is switched off.

The PS-HEV, as is mass-produced by 
Toyota in the Prius model, has the arrange-
ment described. The two paths combine 
the fundamental principles of the series 
and parallel hybrid drives, which is why 
the power-branching drive is also referred 
to as a series-parallel topology.

18 Planetary-gear set (load distributor)

Continuously variable transmission
A significant advantage of the power-
branching concept lies in the Continuously 
Variable Transmission [CVT] behavior and 
thus with the associated free selection of 
the internal-combustion engine’s operat-
ing point. Moreover, the drivetrain can be 
realized without a conventional transmis-
sion and in particular without gearshift 
and clutch elements, which results in high 
driving comfort without traction-force 
interruption and in reduced mechanical 
components. 

On the other hand, decoupling the engine 
speed from the driving speed can give rise 
to a more unusual driving feel – especially 
for European car drivers. In this respect it 
is comparable with the driveability of vehi-
cles with conventional CVT transmissions.

System limits
The previously discussed limitations of a 
series hybrid with regard to the dimen-
sioning of the electric motors and the 
efficiency chain are lessened in the power-
branching concept. Because a significant 
amount of drive energy is transported 
via the electrical path, powerful electric 
motors are required – depending on the 
layout of the drivetrain. The necessary en-
ergy-conversion processes have an effect 
on the overall efficiency of the drive – par-
ticularly if the vehicle is to be used over a 
wide driving-speed range. The upshot of 
this is that the great savings potential that 
the vehicle demonstrates in urban traffic 
is not manifested to this extent in long-dis-
tance or interstate driving. 

In order to obtain an improvement in 

this field, vehicles are currently being 
developed which have two driving modes 
and are therefore known as two-mode 
hybrids.

Two-mode hybrid
Fig. 19 shows a possible design for a 
two-mode hybrid. In this example the 
two-mode hybrid has two electrical CVT 
drive positions and one purely mechani-
cal transmission. It is possible through the 
possibilities of combining the input and 
output shafts of the planetary-gear set to 
achieve improved efficiency over a wide 
spread of driving speeds. 

The direct mechanical gear step is made 
possible by the use of two clutches. The 
excellent overall efficiency and the many 
degrees of freedom of this concept are 
offset by the system’s high complexity and 
relatively high costs.

Operation of hybrid vehicles

Operation of a hybrid electric vehicle is 
essentially determined by the operating 
strategy. Depending on the higher opti-
mization objective (reduced emissions, 
fuel economy), the operating strategy 
 establishes at every moment the distri-
bution of the requested drive torque to 
the internal-combustion engine and the 
electric motor so that the engine oper-
ates at the most favorable operating 
points possible. The operating strategy 
also controls the generation of electrical 
energy for charging the traction battery.

Hybrid control

The efficiency which can be achieved with 
the relevant hybrid drive is dependent not 
only on the hybrid topology but also cru-
cially on the higher-level hybrid control. 
Fig. 20 uses the example of a vehicle with a 
parallel hybrid drive to show the network-
ing of the individual components and con-
trol systems in the drivetrain. The higher-
level hybrid control coordinates the entire 
system, the subsystems of which have 
their own control functions. These control 

functions are battery management, engine 
management, management of the electric 
drive, transmission management and man-
agement of the braking system. In addi-
tion to pure control of the subsystems, the 
hybrid control also includes an operating 
strategy which optimizes the way in which 
the drivetrain is operated. The operat-
ing strategy brings influence to bear on 
the consumption- and emission-reducing 
functions of the HEV, i.e., on start-stop op-
eration of the engine, regenerative braking 
and operating-point optimization. These 
include the decisions on a driving state 
such as electric driving or recuperation 
and distribution of the driver-command 
torque to the engine and electric motor. 

An important integral part of operating-
point optimization is the electric-driving 
function. It is possible through boost-
ing the electric drive to achieve a higher 
torque and thus a better acceleration ca-
pability particularly at low engine speeds. 
This requires a holistic consideration of 
design and operating-strategy optimiza-
tion to exploit the maximum potential.

  Operation of hybrid vehicles  |  Operating strategies for hybrid vehicles

Operating strategy here means a driving-
situation-dependent distribution of torque 
between the two drive sources of engine 
and electric motor.

Operating strategies  
for hybrid vehicles

Further steps for reducing CO2 are cur-
rently required for all internal-combustion 
engine concepts. Furthermore, vehicles 
with diesel engines show a reduction po-
tential with regard to untreated NOX emis-
sions. Improvements can be achieved here 
by moving the engine operating points into 
the ranges of lower emissions. 

Operating strategy for reducing NOX
Vehicles with lean-running internal-com-
bustion engines already achieve relatively 
low consumption values in part-load 
operation. At low part load, however, the 
friction loss increases such that the spe-
cific fuel consumption is also high. In ad-
dition, low combustion temperatures and 
a local oxygen deficiency in the low part-
load range result in high carbon-monox-
ide and hydrocarbon emissions. 

Already a relatively weak electric assem-
bly can replace the internal-combustion 
engine in the low load range. If the re-
quired electrical energy can be recovered 
through regeneration, this simple strategy 
can deliver a huge benefit with regard to 
fuel consumption and emissions.

It is to be expected that in future lower 
emission limits will be increased for ni-
trogen oxides. By avoiding unfavorable 
engine operating points, hybridization 
of a diesel vehicle offers the possibility 
of significantly influencing exhaust-gas 
emissions. With low engine emissions the 
measures for exhaust-gas treatment could 
be partially reduced.

Fig. 21a shows the ranges in which the in-
ternal-combustion engine is primarily op-
erated in the New European Driving Cycle 
(NEDC). The passenger-car diesel engine 
is operated both at low part load (i.e., with 
poor efficiency levels and high HC and 
CO emissions) and at medium/higher load 
(i.e., in the range of high NOX emissions).

Fig. 21b shows by way of example the 
range of operating points for a parallel hy-
brid which bypasses low internal-combus-
tion engine loads through purely electric 
driving and/or load-point increase. This on 
the one hand reduces the fuel consump-
tion, but on the other hand reduces the CO, 
HC and NOX emissions – which are high in 
this range. To achieve a further lowering of 
NOX emissions, it is possible to lower load 
points in the medium load range by simul-
taneously operating electric motor and 
engine (boosting). 

Operating strategy for reducing CO2
With vehicles with stoichiometrically run-
ning gasoline engines extremely low emis-
sion values can be realized on account of 
the three-way catalytic converter used. 
In the hybrid vehicle extremely low emis-
sions are also possible with large-capacity 
internal-combustion engines by means of 
appropriate warm-up strategies. Under 
circumstances the demands place on the 
exhaust-gas treatment system can even be 
reduced. The objectives for both gasoline 
hybrid vehicles and diesel hybrid vehicles 
are thus fuel economy and increased 
power.

Fig. 22 shows for the different HEV topolo-
gies a possible optimization of the operat-
ing range of the internal-combustion en-
gine with regard to minimum CO2 emis-
sions (i.e., reduced consumption). 

In the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) 
internal-combustion engines in conven-
tional vehicles are operated at low part 
load and thus at suboptimum efficiency. 
In vehicles with parallel hybrid drives low 
engine loads can be avoided by means of 
purely electric driving (Fig. 22b). 

Since the required electrical energy as 

a rule cannot be recovered exclusively 
through recuperation, the electric motor is 
then operated as a generator. This results, 
when compared with a conventional vehi-
cle, in a shift in engine operation to higher 
loads and thus better levels of efficiency. 
In this way more electrical energy can 
be made available than in the previously 
described NOX strategy for diesel, and as 
a result electric driving is possible to a 
greater extent. But, here too, on account of 
the service-life requirements of the trac-
tion battery, a compromise must be found 
between CO2 emissions and the energy 
throughput, since a high energy through-
put has a negative influence of the service 
life of the traction battery.

  Operation of hybrid vehicles  |  Operating-point optimization

To exploit the fuel-economy potential, in 
particular distributing the requested drive 
torque to the drive source of engine and 
electric motor is hugely important. 

Determination in the automatic  
state machine
Torque distribution is however not neces-
sary in all driving states. Fig. 23 shows the 
different driving states of a hybrid vehicle 
which a determined in an automatic state 
machine by the driver command, the state 
of the electrical accumulator and the ve-
hicle speed.

In the case of purely electric driving and 
recuperation the internal-combustion en-
gine is shut down and in boost mode the 
maximum available torque is requested 
from both drive sources. Purely electric 
driving is limited to low vehicle speeds 
and low accelerations. Recuperation oc-
curs only when the vehicle is decelerating. 
Boost mode is then used above all when 
maximum propulsion is requested by the 
driver (kickdown). 

In the case of the power-branching hybrid 
vehicle (Fig. 22 c), the operating range of 
the internal-combustion engine is subject 
to greater limitations than the parallel 
hybrid vehicle. As a rule it is operated as 
a function of engine speed at the load at 
which the entire drivetrain operates under 
optimum energy conditions. Here, too, it is 
possible, because of the series operating 
mode, on the electrical path (simultane-
ous operation of the two electric motors 
as generators and motors) to keep energy 
throughput and cycling of the traction bat-
tery lower than in a parallel hybrid.

Operating-point optimization

Distribution of drive torque
Different configurations of hybrid vehicle 
control or operating-strategy optimization 
have significant effects on fuel consump-
tion, emissions, available torque, and the 
layout of the components (e.g., operating 
range of the electric motor and of the en-
gine, energy throughput and cyclization 
of the electrical accumulator), since their 
operating points are directly dependent 
on the operating strategy. It has already 
become clear that cross-system hybrid 
control is of crucial importance. There is 
a multitude of possibilities and degrees of 
freedom for optimizing operation.

Determining the equivalence value
Determining and optimizing this equiva-
lence value can be done in different ways. 
The optimum can only be found when 
the entire driving cycle is known, which 
amounts to a look into the future (a priori 
knowledge). However, this look into the 
future is only possible during specified 
driving cycles or during simulation. In real 
driving operation only present and past 
driving states can be used to determine the 
equivalence value (a posteriori knowledge). 
The different optimization horizon for the 
equivalence value is shown in Fig. 25.

The diagram shows by way of example the 
speed characteristic of the NEDC driving 
cycle. Time t = 625 s is taken as the pres-
ent. Without knowing the full distance, 
the last long braking from 120 km/h to a 
stop, which contains a large recuperation 
potential, cannot be used to optimize the 
equivalence value.

Distribution by operating strategy
The wide range of hybrid driving in which 
distribution of the drive torque is to be 
specified lies between the operating states 
which are determined by the automatic 
state machine. On account of the many 
degrees of freedom and dependencies an 
optimization is required which can be real-
ized most effectively with the aid of model-
based procedures.

Fig. 24 shows the dependencies of the 
operating strategy. The hybrid control 
distributes the desired drive torque to the 
drive sources of engine and electric mo-
tor, including in so doing among others the 
vehicle speed and the state of the electri-
cal accumulator. In addition the operating 
strategy still requires an equivalence value 
of the stored electrical energy, which con-
tains how much fuel has been consumed in 
order to generate this electrical energy. 

The different types of electrical energy 
generation (recuperation and combustion-
engine charging) in order to assign to the 
battery’s energy content an equivalence 
value of the optimization variable (e.g., 
fuel consumption). This equivalence value 
provides the basis for deciding which en-
ergy is used.

Fig. 26 uses the cumulative fuel consump-
tion to show the different optimization ho-
rizons. The consumption of a comparable 
conventional vehicle is also shown. It can 
be recognized that an a priori optimization 
exploits additional potential, since it can 
among other things utilize the recupera-
tion phase at the end of the cycle.

If the operating-strategy optimization is 
networked with driver-assistance systems, 
e.g., with a navigation system, the future 
driving profile (especially the speed pro-
file) can be estimated down to a certain 
level.

Design of the internal- 
combustion engine

Use of suitable internal-combustion 
engines
It is basically possible to use any internal-
combustion engine from vehicles with con-
ventional drivetrains in a hybrid vehicle. 
Gasoline, natural-gas and diesel engines 
can be combined with an electric drive, 
but with different optimization objec-
tives (see sections Operating strategy for 
diesel hybrid vehicles / for gasoline hybrid 
 vehicles).

Thanks to the additional possibilities 
provided by the HEV interconnection for 
example with regard to operating-point 
shifting, it is also possible if necessary 
to pursue for hybrid vehicles internal-
combustion engine concepts which are 
different from those for conventionally 
driven vehicles. Because of the reduced 
size of the operating range, the necessary 
efficiency optimization can be limited to 
this range and high costs for additional 
components can be avoided. For example, 
the second turbocharger in modern twin 
turbocharging concepts can be dispensed 
with, since its functions (providing for a 
fast response and for a higher torque at 
low engine speeds) are covered by the 
electric motor. 

If sufficient power is made available by 
the electrical accumulator, the electric 
drive can compensate for torque deficits 
and a slower response by certain engine 
concepts. 

Strategy of electrical energy generation
In the hybrid vehicle electrical energy 
can be generated by means of battery 
charging with the engine and by means 
of recuperation (recovery of braking 
energy). Whereas energy is recovered 
without additional fuel expenditure during 
recuperation, fuel must be expended to 
charge the battery with the engine. Here 
the efficiency of this charging process is 
dependent on the engine’s current operat-
ing point.

Because for the most part not enough 
energy can be generated from recupera-
tion alone and furthermore the storage 
capability of the battery is limited, charg-
ing with the engine cannot be avoided. To 
keep the amount of fuel to be expended for 
this purpose as low as possible, this type 
of power generation is performed then if 
possible when the engine is operated in 
operating ranges with poor efficiency and 
as large an efficiency increase as possible 
can be achieved by means of the addi-
tional load (Fig. 27). Optimum utilization 
of  efficiency improvement when charging 
with the engine is the function of the op-
erating strategy in that this also involves a 
distribution of torque between the engine 
and the electric motor.

Dynamic demands placed on the drive-

to the favorable torque characteristic 
above all at low engine speeds and the fast 
response of the electric drive. Load peaks 
on the engine can therefore be avoided.

Atkinson cycle
The previously described altered require-
ments with regard to maximum power 
and dynamic response make it possible to 
use the Atkinson cycle, which cannot be 
used with a conventional drive because 
of the lower specific power (due to poor 
full-load charge) and weakness in dynamic 
processes. The Atkinson cycle (Fig. 28) 
necessitates a different stroke/bore ratio 
of compression and expansion strokes, 
which geometrically can only be realized 
with difficulty, but can be represented with 
the aid of variable valve timing. It offers a 
better utilization of the expansion phase 
and thereby increased efficiency. 

This concept is implemented, for ex-
ample, in the Toyota Prius. In addition, the 

maximum rotational speed is limited here 
in order to reduce the basic friction of the 
overall engine through a weaker design of 
the valve gear. The required maximum ro-
tational speed of the generator can be kept 
small here.

Downsizing
In addition to using simple or cost-effec-
tive internal-combustion engines, specific 
optimization of the internal-combustion 
engine in combination with an electric 
drive delivers advantages. One possibility 
for improvement is offered by downsiz-
ing, which anticipates reducing engine 
displacement while retaining the power 
output with the aid of turbocharging. Here,

Friction optimization of the  
internal-combustion engine
Some primary energy is saved in a hybrid 
vehicle through the recovery of braking 
energy (recuperation). This can be per-
formed during both active braking and 
overrunning, e.g., when driving downhill. 
To exploit the savings potential as fully as 
possible, the internal-combustion engine 
must be shut down in these operating 
ranges. If this is not possible, the engine 
must be under coupled motion and its drag 
friction limits the recuperation potential. 
In this case, friction optimization of the 
engine represents an important require-
ment of the engine. 

through the use of the electric motor’s 
drive power, unfavorable operating ranges 
can be avoided and dynamic torque weak-
nesses compensated for.

In the case of the hybrid vehicle, how-
ever, it is also possible with downsizing to 
tolerate a reduction in engine power, since 
this can be compensated for with the aid of 
the electric drive. The overall drive power 
remains the same here. However, in this 
case, the maximum power is only available 
for a limited time (necessitated by the bat-
tery charge), which gives rise to a reduced 
sustained vehicle top speed.

Optimization with regard to emissions 
and fuel consumption
To achieve the objectives of reduced emis-
sions and consumption, it is possible to ex-
ploit degrees of freedom for engine opera-
tion which are dependent on the topology 
of the drivetrain. 

An important strategy is to avoid operating 
points at which the engine demonstrates 
unfavorable efficiency or high emissions. 
The underlying operating strategy must be 
optimized with regard to the improvement 
objective (e.g., reduced consumption or 
reduced CO2 or NOX). The changed operat-
ing conditions can be utilized to optimize 
the engine concept and exhaust-gas treat-
ment. From the changed requirements 
there follow changes in functions and in 
the application of engine management, 
which are not considered further here.

   Regenerative braking system     Strategies

Regenerative braking system

During regenerative braking kinetic en-
ergy of the drive wheels is converted by 
the electric motor – which is operated as 
a generator for this purpose – into elec-
trical energy. In this way some of the en-
ergy which is normally lost as frictional 
heat during braking is fed in the form of 
electric energy to the battery and then 
utilized. At the same time the generator 
operation of the electric motor brings 
about a vehicle-braking effect. 

To use a hybrid-drive system to better ef-
fect, it is necessary to be able to charge the 
electrical energy accumulator efficiently. 
Sufficient electrical energy must be made 
available for

 • the under certain circumstances fre-

quently occurring restarts of the com-
bustion engine at the start/stop system, 

 • electric torque assistance or electric 
driving operation in the case of mild- 
and full-hybrid systems. 

On the one hand, the electrical energy for 
charging the battery can be produced by 
increasing the engine load and by operat-
ing the electric motor as a generator. On 
the other hand, it is sensible to use the 
vehicle’s kinetic energy during decelera-
tion processes. In conventional vehicles 
this energy is converted into heat either by 
the engine drag torque or when the brake 
pedal is operated by the vehicle service 
brake. 

Through generator use of the electric 
motor, hybrid vehicles open up the pos-
sibility of recovering at least some of the 
energy and supplying it either to the elec-
trical loads/consumers or to the vehicle’s 
electric drive. This process is known as 
regenerative or recuperative braking.

Strategies of regenerative 
braking

Principle
In the case of a full hybrid, for the purpose 
of regenerative braking, the internal-com-
bustion engine is decoupled and the drag 
torque is replaced by an equivalent gen-
erator torque of the electric motor (drag-
torque simulation). The energy released is 
stored. 

If the engine cannot be decoupled (as in 

the case of a mild hybrid), alternatively a 
lower generator torque can be impressed 
on the drivetrain in addition to the engine 
drag torque (drag-torque increase). 

However, when driveability is taken into 
consideration, no great decelerations can 
be implemented through drag-torque 
simulation or increase. What is problem-
atic is the different regenerative braking 
torque during the individual braking pro-
cesses and the resulting different braking 
power. This must be adapted to the battery 
state of charge and the thermal load of the 
electric drive. If, for example, the battery 
temperature increases significantly after a 
few brakings, it is necessary under certain 
circumstances to recover the regenerative 
power in order to avoid thermal overload-
ing of the system.

Cooperatively regenerative braking 
system
The service-brake system must be modi-
fied in the case of higher decelerations in 
order to further exploit the kinetic energy. 
To this end all or some of the service-brake 
friction torque must be replaced with 
regenerative braking torque without the 
vehicle deceleration changing when the 
brake-pedal position and force are kept 
constant. This is realized in a coopera-
tively regenerative braking system, where 
vehicle control and braking system inter-
act in such a way that constantly as much 
friction braking torque is recovered as 
generator braking torque can be replaced 
by the electric motor. 

Requirements
A cooperatively regenerative braking 
system must satisfy the following require-
ments:

 • determination of the driver’s decelera-

tion command,

 • maintenance of the power capability 
usual for conventional vehicles and 
 operation of the service brake,

 • determination of a suitable distribution 

of braking torque between friction brake 
and regenerative brake, taking into 
 account stability, comfort and efficiency 
criteria,

 • determination of a suitable distribution 
of braking torque to the vehicle axles,

 • adjustment of the friction braking 

torque.

Replacing the regenerative braking torque 
with the friction braking torque calls for 
a suitable data interface between the cor-
responding drivetrain ECUs and the brake 
control unit.

Cooperative braking maneuvers
During a braking operation the maximum 
generator torque that can be achieved by 
the electric motor changes over a wide 
speed range (Fig. 1). This results from the 
fact that the power output of the electric 
motor (i.e., torque * speed) is constant in 
this range. Only at low rotational speeds is 
there a range of a constant maximum elec-
tric-motor torque. If the rotational speed 
decreases, the achievable regenerative 
braking torque drops back to zero.

A constant deceleration of the vehicle 
requires a constant torque at the wheels. 
If the electric motor operated as a gen-
erator is exploited to its limit torque, the 
friction braking torque must be continu-
ously reduced as vehicle speed decreases, 
because the generator torque increases. 
A braking operation of a power-branch-
ing hybrid is shown by way of example in 
Fig. 2. At the beginning of the maneuver 
the generator torque is increased until it 
reaches its maximum (if this corresponds 
to the requested overall braking torque). 
Towards the end of the braking opera-
tion the generator torque is reduced and 
completely replaced by friction braking 
torque, because the electric motor cannot 
deliver any more generator torque at very 
low rotational speeds (Fig. 1).

   Regenerative braking system     Strategies

During a braking operation from high ve-
hicle speed to a stop distribution between 
friction braking torque and regenerative 
braking torque is therefore continuously 
adapted with the pedal constantly actuated. 

If the vehicle is a rear-wheel drive or has 
an electrified rear axle (i.e., engine on the 
front axle and electric motor on the rear 
axle), the offsettable regenerative torque 
decreases as deceleration increases. 

Braking-force distribution
As is the case with the design of conven-
tional braking systems, the braking-force 
distribution between front and rear axles 
is of crucial importance to the vehicle’s 
directional stability also in the case of the 
design of a regenerative braking system. 
As deceleration increases, the normal 
force on the front wheels increases while 
the normal force on the rear wheels 
 decreases. 

If the electric motor is connected to the 
front wheels, a greater wheel torque can 
be transmitted as deceleration increases 
and thus normal force increases. For this 
reason, in order to maintain directional 
stability, friction-coefficient utilization on 
the front axle should not exceed friction-
coefficient utilization on the rear axle.

Even the electrical power of the battery 
has a major influence on the utilization of 
recuperation, since the limiting element 
for absorbing electrical energy is from the 
vehicle motion. As the power of the energy 
accumulator increases, so the maximum 
possible purely recuperative deceleration 
increases. For reasons of vehicle stability, 
however, a large generator braking torque 
can only be transmitted to the front axle. 
High purely recuperative decelerations 
can therefore only be achieved with a ve-
hicle with front-wheel drive or four-wheel 
drive. In the case of the latter, the braking 
torque is distributed to both axles, de-
pending on the configuration of the center 
differential, in such a way that it corre-
sponds at least approximately to the ideal 
braking-force distribution of the friction 
brake.

Influences on stability control
Because the regenerative braking system 
influences braking stability, ABS and ESP 
control operations must be adapted to the 
altered driving physics.

It is advisable to suppress the regenera-
tive component of braking when unstable 
driving states or excessively high brake 
slip are detected and to represent deceler-
ation and stabilization interventions alone 
by the friction-brake system. Otherwise in-
stabilities and drivetrain oscillations could 
disrupt an optimum wheel-slip control 
operation.

Interventions of the vehicle stabilization 
system over the vehicle’s life are so rare in 
proportion to the partial braking opera-
tions that suppressing recuperative brak-
ing in these situations does not have any 
noticeable influence on the vehicle’s aver-
age consumption.

Implementation of the service brake
The friction brake of the cooperatively 
regenerative braking system can be repre-
sented in different configurations. 

It is primarily mechatronic braking sys-
tems which decouple the brake pedal and 
wheel brake and represent the brake-
pedal characteristic by adding a pedal sim-
ulator. Here the energy for brake boosting 
can be stored hydraulically, pneumatically 
or electrically.

Common to all implementations is the 
block diagram of the cooperatively regen-
erative braking system (Fig. 3). The vehicle 
control continuously monitors all the rel-
evant parameters of the hybrid drive and 
determines which torque the electric mo-
tor can make available for braking. When 
the brake pedal is actuated the torque 
coordinator of the brake control unit cal-
culates a distribution of the braking torque 
to the friction brake and the recuperative 
braking system. 

The recuperative torque component is 
signaled back to the vehicle control and 
from there forwarded to the electric-motor 
actuator. The residual braking torque is 
adjusted by the friction brake while vehi-
cle stability and wheel slip are monitored.

Many factors influence workshop business.
Current trends are, for example:
(cid:2) The proportion of diesel passenger cars is

rising

(cid:2) Longer service intervals and longer service
lives of automotive parts mean that vehi-
cles are being checked into workshops less
frequently

(cid:2) Workshop capacity utilization in the over-
all market will continue to decline in the
next few years

(cid:2) The need for workshop personnel to be
properly qualified is increasing dramati-
cally

(cid:2) Investment by workshops in diagnosis,
technical information and training is
 essential

Measurement and test technology
The crucial step for workshops to take is to
invest in the right test technology, diagnostic
software, technical information, and techni-
cal training in order to receive the best pos-
sible support and assistance for all the jobs
and tasks in the workshop process.

Workshop processes
The essential tasks which come up in the
workshop can be portrayed in processes.
Two distinct subprocesses are used for han-
dling all tasks in the service and repair fields.
The first subprocess covers the predomi-
nantly operations and organization-based
activity of job order acceptance, while the
second subprocess covers the predominantly
technically based work steps of service and
repair implementation. 

Job order acceptance
When a vehicle arrives in the workshop, the
job order acceptance system’s database fur-
nishes immediate access to all available in-
formation on the vehicle. The moment the
vehicle enters the shop, the system provides
access to its entire history. This includes all
service work and repairs carried out on the
vehicle up to that point. Furthermore, this
sequence involves the completion of all tasks
relating to the customer’s request, its basic
feasibility, scheduling of completion dates,
provision of resources, parts and working
materials and equipment, and an initial ex-
amination of the task and extent of work in-
volved. Depending on the process objective,
all subfunctions of the ESI[tronic] product
are used within the framework of the service
acceptance process.

Service and repair implementation
Here, the jobs defined within the framework
of the job order acceptance are carried out.
If it is not possible to complete the task in a
single process cycle, appropriate repeat loops
must be provided until the targeted process
result is achieved. Depending on the process
objective, all subfunctions of the ESI[tronic]
product are used within the framework of the
service and repair implementation process.

Electronic service information
(ESI[tronic])
System functions for supporting the
 workshop process
ESI[tronic] is a modular software product
for the automotive engineering trade. The
individual modules contain the following
information:
(cid:2) Technical information on spare parts and

automotive equipment

(cid:2) Exploded views and parts lists for spare

parts and assemblies

(cid:2) Technical data and setting values
(cid:2) Flat rate units and times for work on the

vehicle

nosis

(cid:2) Vehicle diagnosis and vehicle system diag-

(cid:2) Troubleshooting instructions for different

vehicle systems

(cid:2) Repair instructions for vehicle compo-

nents, e.g. diesel power units
(cid:2) Electronic circuit diagrams
(cid:2) Maintenance schedules and diagrams
(cid:2) Test and setting values for assemblies
(cid:2) Data for costing maintenance, repair and

service work

Application
The chief users of ESI[tronic] are motor
garages/workshops, assembly repairers and
the automotive parts wholesale trade. They
use the technical information for the follow-
ing purposes:
(cid:2) Motor garages/workshops: mainly for
 diagnosis, service and repair of vehicle
systems

3

ESI[tronic] workshop software for all vehicle makes

(cid:2) Assembly repairers: mainly for testing, ad-

justing and repair of assemblies

(cid:2) Automotive parts wholesale trade: mainly

for parts information

Garages/workshops and assembly repairers
use this parts information in addition to
 diagnosis, repair and service information.
Product interfaces enable ESI[tronic] to net-
work with other (particularly commercial)
software in the workshop environment and
the automotive parts wholesale trade in
 order, for instance, to exchange data with
the accounting merchandise information
system.

Benefit to the user of ESI[tronic]
The benefit of using ESI[tronic] lies in the
fact that the system furnishes a large amount
of information which is needed to conduct
and safeguard the business of motor
garages/workshops. This is made possible
by the broadly conceived and modular
ESI[tronic] product program. The informa-
tion is offered on one interface with a stan-
dardized system for all vehicle makes.

Comprehensive vehicle coverage is impor-
tant for workshop business in that the nec-
essary information is always to hand. This is
guaranteed by ESI[tronic] because country-
specific vehicle databases and information
on new vehicles are incorporated in the
product planning. Regular updating of the
software offers the best opportunity of keep-
ing abreast of technical developments in the
automotive industry.

Vehicle system analysis (FSA)
Vehicle system analysis (FSA) from Bosch
offers a simple solution to complex vehicle
diagnosis. The causes of a problem can be
swiftly located thanks to diagnosis interfaces
and fault memories in the on-board elec-
tronics of modern motor vehicles. The com-
ponent testing facility of FSA developed by
Bosch is very useful in swiftly locating a
fault: The FSA measurement technology and
display can be adjusted to the relevant com-

ponent. This enables this component to be
tested while it is still installed.

Measuring equipment
Workshop personnel can choose from
 various options for diagnosis and trouble -
shooting: the high-performance, portable
KTS 650 system tester or the workshop-
compatible KTS 520 and KTS 550 KTS
modules in conjunction with a standard PC
or laptop. The modules have an integrated
multimeter, and KTS 550 and KTS 650 also
have a 2-channel oscilloscope. For work
 applications on the vehicle, ESI[tronic] is
 installed in the KTS 650 or on a PC.

Example of the sequence in the
 workshop
The ESI[tronic] software package supports
workshop personnel throughout the entire
vehicle repair process A diagnosis interface
allows ESI[tronic] to communicate with the
electronic systems within the vehicle, such as
the ESP electronic control unit. Working at
the PC, the technician starts by selecting the
SIS (service information system) utility to
initiate diagnosis of on-board control units
and access the ECU’s fault memory. 

The diagnostic tester provides the data
needed for direct comparisons of specified
results and current readings, without the
need for supplementary entries. ESI[tronic]
uses the results of the diagnosis as the basis
for generating specific repair instructions.
The system also provides displays with other
information, such as component locations,
exploded views of assemblies, diagrams
showing the layouts of electrical, pneumatic
and hydraulic systems etc. Working at the
PC, users can then proceed directly from the
exploded views to the parts lists with part
numbers to order the required replacement
components. All service procedures and re-
placement components are recorded to sup-
port the billing process. After the final road
test, the bill is produced simply by pressing a
few keys. The system also provides a clear
and concise printout with the results of the
vehicle diagnosis. This offers the customer a
full report detailing all of the service opera-
tions and materials that went into the vehi-
cle’s repair.

Diagnostics in the workshop

Diagnostics in the workshop

The function of these diagnostics is to
identify the smallest, defective, replaceable
unit quickly and reliably. The guided trou-
bleshooting procedure includes onboard
information and offboard test procedures
and testers. Support is provided by elec-
tronic service information (ESI[tronic]).
Instructions for further troubleshooting
are provided for a wide variety of possible
problems (for example, ESP intervenes
prematurely due to variant encoding) and
faults (such as no signal from speed
 sensor). 

Guided troubleshooting
The main element is the guided trou-
bleshooting procedure. The workshop em-
ployee is guided by a symptom-dependent,
event-controlled procedure, which initiates

with the symptom (vehicle symptom or
 fault memory entry). Onboard (fault mem-
ory entry) and offboard facilities (actuator
diagnostics and offboard testers) are used.

The guided troubleshooting, readout of the
fault memory, workshop diagnostic func-
tions and electrical communication with
offboard testers take place using PC-based
diagnostic testers. This may be a specific
workshop tester from the vehicle manufac-
turer or a universal tester (e.g. KTS 650 by
Bosch). 

Reading out fault memory entries
Fault information (fault memory entries)
stored during vehicle operation are read out
via a serial interface during vehicle service or
repair in the customer service workshop.

Fault entries are read out using a diagnos-

tic tester. The workshop employee receives
information about:
(cid:2) Malfunctions (e.g. engine temperature

(cid:2) Fault codes (e.g. short circuit to ground,

implausible signal, static fault)

(cid:2) Ambient conditions (measured values on
fault storage, e.g. engine speed, engine
temperature etc.).

actuators at the customer service workshop
and test their functionality. This test mode is
started using the diagnostic tester and only
functions when the vehicle is at a complete
stop below a specific engine speed, or when
the engine is switched off. This allows an
acoustic (e.g. valve clicking), visual (e.g. flap

movement), or other type of inspection, e.g.
measurement of electric signals, to test actu-
ator function.

Workshop diagnostic functions
Faults that the on-board diagnosis fails to
detect can be localized using support func-
tions. These diagnostic functions are imple-
mented in the ECU and are controlled by
the diagnostic tester.

Workshop diagnostic functions run auto-
matically, either after they are started by the
diagnostic tester, or they report back to the
diagnostic tester at the end of the test, or the
diagnostic tester assumes runtime control,
measured data acquisition, and data evalua-
tion. The control unit then implements indi-
vidual commands only.

Example
The assignment test checks that the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP) activates the
wheel brake cylinders of the correct wheels.
For this test, the vehicle is driven into the
brake tester. After the technician starts the
function, the diagnostic tester indicates how
to proceed. After the brake pedal is acti-
vated, individual channels of the ESP
 hydraulic modulator are brought, one after
another, to the pressure drop position.
This allows a determination to be made
of whether the corresponding wheel can be
rotated. The diagnostic tester indicates the
wheel for which the system has reduced the
brake pressure. In this way, it can be deter-
mined whether the circuitry of the hydraulic
modulator and wheel brake cylinders is
 correct.

Testing equipment

Testing equipment

Effective testing of the system requires the
use of special testing equipment. While ear-
lier electronic systems could be tested with
basic equipment such as a multimeter, on -
going advances have resulted in electronic
 systems that can only be diagnosed with
complex testers.

The system testers of the KTS series 

are widely used in workshops. The KTS 650
(Fig. 1) offers a wide range of capabilities for
use in the vehicle repairs, enhanced in par-
ticular by its graphical display of data such
as test results. These system testers are also
known as diagnostic testers.

Functions of the KTS 650
The KTS 650 offers a wide variety of func-
tions, which are selected by means of but-
tons and menus on the large display screen.
The list below details the most important
functions offered by the KTS 650.

Identification
The system automatically detects the con-
nected ECU and reads actual values, fault
memories and ECU-specific data.

Reading/erasing the fault memory
The fault information detected during
 vehicle operation by on-board diagnosis
and stored in the fault memory can be read
with the KTS 650 and displayed on screen
in plain text.

Reading actual values
Current values calculated by the ECU can be
read out as physical values (e.g. wheel speeds
in km/h).

Actuator diagnostics
The electrical actuators (e.g. valves, relays)
can be specifically triggered for function
testing purposes.

Test functions
The diagnostic tester triggers programmed
test procedures in the ECU. These allow test-
ing of whether the channels of the ABS hy-
draulic modulator are correctly assigned 
to the wheel brake cylinders. 

Multimeter function
Electrical current, voltage and resistance can
be tested in the same way as with a conven-
tional multimeter.

Time graph display
The continuously recorded measured values
are displayed graphically as a signal curve, as 
with an oscilloscope (e.g. signal voltage of
the wheel speed sensors).

Additional information
Specific additional information relevant to
the faults/components displayed can also be
shown in conjunction with the electronic
service information (ESI[tronic]) (e.g. trou-
bleshooting instructions, location of com-
ponents in the engine compartment, test
specifications, electrical circuit diagrams).

Printout
All data (e.g. list of actual values or docu-
ment for the customer) can be printed out
on standard PC printers.

Programming
The software of the ECU can be encoded
 using the KTS 650 (e.g. variant coding of the
ESP ECU).

The extent to which the capabilities of the
KTS 650 can be utilized in the workshop
 depends on the system to be tested. Not all
ECUs support its full range of functions.

Brake testing

For compressed-air braking systems, the
 following also need to be checked:
(cid:2) air compressors,
(cid:2) compressed-air cylinders,
(cid:2) antifreeze unit,
(cid:2) valves, cylinders,
(cid:2) pressure regulators,
(cid:2) braking force regulators,
(cid:2) coupling heads and 
(cid:2) the air-tightness of the entire system.

Brake pads and shoes
The brake shoes and pads are the parts of
the braking system that are subject to the
greatest wear as the retardation of the vehi-
cle is achieved by pressing the shoes/pads
against the rotating drums/disks. Proper
maintenance of these components is ab-
solutely essential for the safety of a braking
system.

Checking wear
Assuming they have been correctly fitted,
the rate at which brake pads/shoes wear is
dependent on the properties of the friction
material (e.g. its frictional coefficient), the
manner in which the vehicle is driven and
the loads it carries. 

On most vehicles, reliable checking of the

brake pad wear on disk brakes requires the
removal of the wheels. Attempting to assess
the level of wear with the wheels in place
risks inaccurate conclusions. 

Checking the wear of brake shoes on
drum brakes generally involves removing
not only the wheels but also the brake
drums. 

On some more modern vehicles, inspec-
tion holes allow the brake shoe wear to be
checked without the brake drums having to
be removed, although they are inadequate
for a thorough inspection of overall brake
shoe condition.

Brake testing

Inspection and maintenance
The condition of a vehicle’s braking system
directly affects its safety as well as that of its
occupants and/or the goods it is transport-
ing. That is why the servicing of the braking
system is such an important part of the care
and maintenance of a vehicle.

Transport legislation requires that vehicle
braking systems are inspected at regular in-
tervals. Manufacturers’ authorized dealer-
ships, or approved independent workshops
and brake repair services (such as Bosch Ser-
vice) carry out inspection, maintenance and,
where necessary, repairs of the brake system. 
In Germany, vehicle owners or custodians
must present their vehicles for inspection at
an officially approved testing center at regular
intervals and at their own expense. In Ger-
many, for instance, the last month by which
the vehicle must file for a major roadworthi-
ness inspection is indicated by a  special check
tag on the vehicle’s rear license plate. 

The natural wear of brake system compo-
nents such as the brake pads demands that
the system is regularly serviced outside of
the statutory inspections.

In addition to checking the effectiveness

of the brakes on a brake tester, servicing
should involve regular assessment and main-
tenance of the following components:
(cid:2) brake pads and/or brake shoes,
(cid:2) brake disks, and
(cid:2) brake drums.

On hydraulic braking systems, the following
must also be regularly checked and serviced:
(cid:2) the master cylinder,
(cid:2) wheel brake cylinders,
(cid:2) the brake hoses,
(cid:2) the brake lines,
(cid:2) the brake fluid level and
(cid:2) the brake fluid condition.
Other units, such as the brake booster, brake
force distributor, brake force limiter etc. are
frequently maintenance-free. 

Workshop technology

Brake testing

Important!

The use of brake pads/
shoes that do not match
the specifications of the
brake manufacturer may
render the vehicle’s
 insurance policy void.

Adjustment
There is normally a small gap (clearance)
between the brake pad/shoe and the
disk/drum that prevents continuous abra-
sion of the friction material against the disk
or drum. As the friction material wears, that
gap becomes larger and, in the case of drum
brakes, necessitates regular readjustment of
the shoes (assuming the brakes do not in-
corporate a self-adjusting mechanism).
Disk brakes with an integral parking
brake mechanism automatically readjust
themselves. 

Straightforward disk brakes are likewise

self-adjusting. This means that the brake
pads automatically shift to take up the extra
gap as they wear so that in effect the clear-
ance between the pad and the disk never
changes.

The need for readjustment of the brake
shoes on drum brakes without a self-adjust-
ing mechanism can be detected by the
amount of free play when pressing the brake
pedal.

If, for different brake systems (such as
simplex or duplex brakes), the brake shoes
are adjusted, the information from the brake
manufacturer must be observed. 

Nevertheless, the following basic princi-

ples will always apply: 
Regardless of the type of drum brake, the
brakes on both sides must always be ad-
justed at the same time. On vehicles with
drum brakes all around, all four brakes must
be adjusted at once.

The brakes must be cold before they are
adjusted. The service brakes should be ad-
justed before the handbrake.

Replacing brake pads and shoes
Disk brake pads have to be replaced when
the thickness of the friction material is worn
down to 2 mm.

On systems with wear sensors on the
brake pads, a warning lamp on the instru-
ment panels indicates to the driver that the
pads are in need of imminent replacement
as soon as the remaining thickness is down
to 3.5 mm. 

On drum brakes the brake shoe friction lin-
ing thickness must not be less than 1.5 mm
on cars and 4 mm on commercial vehicles. If
the shoes are unevenly worn, or if the linings
are cracked or chipped, they too must be re-
placed.

When replacing brake pads or shoes, it is
important that the new pads/shoes conform
to the specifications of the original equip-
ment manufacturer.

Brake pads, disks, shoes and drums must
 always be replaced on both sides (i.e. both
front or both rear wheels) at the same time,
as otherwise the vehicle may “pull” to one
side under braking. 

Brake disks and drums
Brake disks and drums are made of steel or
cast iron and therefore do not wear as
quickly as the pads and shoes. Nevertheless,
they still have to be maintained at regular
intervals.

The contact surfaces of the brake disks

and brake drums must be checked for: 
(cid:2) striations, 
(cid:2) cracks,
(cid:2) corrosion,
(cid:2) abrasion and
(cid:2) differences of thickness. 
For disk and drum brakes, these defects can
be identified with the naked eye during a vi-
sual check. 

Brake disks can also develop excessive
runout or warping. The degree of runout at
the outer edge of the disk must not exceed
0.2 mm and has to be checked using a dial
gauge. Brake disks with more than the al-
lowable runout must be replaced.

If scored or unevenly worn brake disks are
reground, they must not be reduced to more
than a minimum permissible thickness. 

Brake drums may become misshapen (so
that they are no longer perfectly circular) or
develop hairline cracks. Loss of circularity is
caused by overheating. It can be detected by
pulsating feedback from the brake pedal or,
of course, on a brake tester. Brake drums can
be reground provided the degree of wear or

damage is not excessive. When doing so, the
maximum allowable internal drum diameter
for the particular vehicle must not be ex-
ceeded. If the degree or nature of the dam-
age is such that regrinding the drums is not
possible, the only option is to replace them.
Drums must always be reground or replaced
on both sides (both front or both rear
wheels) at the same time in order to ensure
even braking.

Master cylinder
The wearing parts of the master cylinder are
primarily the cup seals, which are made of a

special rubber compound. They are respon-
sible for creating the seal between the piston
and the cylinder wall. Corrosion, which can
develop as a result of water absorption by
the brake fluid, causes pitting of the cylinder
wall. That roughness then damages the pis-
ton seals by abrading them so that they start
to leak.

Depending on the severity of the prob-
lem, this can result in partial or even total
loss of brake pressure. The response of the
brake pedal when depressed will indicate
whether the primary or the isolating seal is
leaking.

Wheel brake cylinders
As with the master cylinder, the cup seals in
the wheel brake cylinders are subject to
wear. They can similarly develop leaks and
cause corrosion on the cylinder walls. In ad-
dition, wheel brake cylinders can also de-
velop leaks around the sealing caps. This can
lead to brake fluid contaminating the brake
pads/linings and reducing brake efficiency.

The following checks can be carried out to

test the condition of the seals:

Low-pressure test
A pressure gauge is connected to the wheel
brake cylinder and a pressure of 2 to 5 bar is
applied and maintained using a special pedal
positioner. There must be no drop in pres-
sure for a period of 5 minutes.

High-pressure test
A pressure of 80-100 bar is applied. Over a
period of 10 minutes, the pressure may not
drop by more than 10% of its original level.

Pilot pressure test
The pedal positioner is removed and the
pressure drops back to the pilot level (if ap-
plicable; only applies to cylinders with cup
seals) of 0.4-1.7 bar. The pressure should 
not fall below 0.4 bar over a period of
five minutes.

Brake hoses and lines
In theory, brake pipes and hoses are mainte-
nance-free. Nevertheless, they are subject to
environmental effects such as corrosion due
to water and salt and impact damage from
stones, grit and gravel. 

Because of those factors, brake pipes and
hoses should be regularly inspected. Brake
lines should primarily be checked for corro-
sion, while the hoses should be inspected for
abrasion and splits. The unions should be
checked for leaks.

Brake fluid level and condition
The brake fluid level is checked on the brake
fluid reservoir. The fluid level should be
 between the “MAX” and “MIN” marks.
This check provides one means of detecting
whether there are leaks in the braking
 system. If the fluid level is at or below the
“MIN” mark, the system should be checked
for leaks. On some vehicles, a warning lamp
on the instrument panel indicates to the dri-
ver that the fluid level is approaching the
minimum mark.

As brake fluid can absorb water by

 diffusion through the brake hoses, it should
be completely replaced every one to two
years. 

This is absolutely essential for the safety of

the braking system.

256

Workshop technology

Brake testing

1) Caution: 
If the level of fluid in the
reservoir is very low,
 simply adding more fluid
must on no account be
viewed as the solution.
The cause of the fluid
loss must be established
and rectified. Dark or
cloudy brake fluid must
be replaced immediately.

Maintenance checklist
The components of hydraulic brake systems
are subjected to considerable stresses. Heat,
cold and vibration can all lead to material
fatigue in the course of time. Splash water,
especially salt water, and dirt cause corro-
sion and diminish the ability of components
and mechanisms to operate smoothly.
 Consequently, impairment of function
can result.

For safety reasons, therefore, specific
 regular checks and maintenance work are
absolutely essential.

The best time for carrying out such work
is at the end of the winter season because the
exposed components of the brake system are
subjected to the most extreme weather con-
ditions in the winter.

The checks and maintenance operations
 include
(cid:2) visual inspections
(cid:2) function checks
(cid:2) leakage tests
(cid:2) internal examination of brakes
(cid:2) efficiency tests.

Fuel-injection pump test benches

Fuel-injection pump 
test benches

Accurately tested and precisely adjusted
fuel-injection pumps and governor mecha-
nisms are key components for obtaining
 optimized performance and fuel economy
from diesel engines. They are also crucial in
ensuring compliance with increasingly strict
exhaust-gas emission regulations. The fuel-
injection pump test bench (Fig. 1) is a vital
tool for meeting these requirements. 

The main specifications governing both test
bench and test procedures are defined by ISO
standards; particularly demanding are the
specifications for rigidity and geometrical
consistency in the drive unit (5). 

As time progresses, so do the levels of
peak pressure that fuel-injection pumps are
expected to generate. This development is
reflected in higher performance demands
and power requirements for pump test
benches. Powerful electric drive units, a large
flyweight and precise control of rotational
speed guarantee stability at all engine speeds.
This stability is an essential requirement for

repeatable, mutually comparable measure-
ments and test results.

Flow measurement methods
An important test procedure is to measure
the fuel pumped each time the plunger
moves through its stroke. For this test, the
fuel-injection pump is clamped on the test
bench support (1), with its drive side con-
nected to the test bench drive coupling. Test-
ing proceeds with a standardized calibrating
oil at a precisely monitored and controlled
temperature. A special, precision-calibrated
nozzle-and-holder assembly (3) is connected
to each pump barrel. This strategy ensures
mutually comparable measurements for each
test. Two test methods are available.

Glass gauge method (MGT)
The test bench features an assembly with
two glass gauges (Fig. 2, 5). A range of gages
with various capacities are available for each
cylinder. This layout can be used to test 
fuel-injection pumps for engines of up 
to 12 cylinders.

In the first stage, the discharged calibrating
flows past the glass gages to return directly to
the oil tank. As soon as the fuel-injection
pump reaches the rotational speed indicated
in the test specifications, a slide valve opens,
allowing the calibrating oil from the fuel-in-
jection pump to flow to the glass gages. Sup ply
to the glass containers is then interrupted
when the pump has executed the preset num-
ber of strokes. 

The fuel quantity delivered to each cylinder

in cm3 can now be read from each of 
the glass gages. The standard test period is
1,000 strokes, making it easy to interpret the
numerical result in mm3 per stroke of deliv-
ered fuel. The test results are compared with
the setpoint values and entered in the test
record.

Electronic flow measurement system (KMA)
This system replaces the glass gauges with a
control, display and processor unit (Fig. 1, 6).
While this unit is usually mounted on the test
bench, it can also be installed on a cart next to
the test bench. 

This test relies on continuous measuring the

delivery capacity (Fig. 3). A control plunger
(6) is installed in parallel with the  input and
output sides of a gear pump (2). When the
pump’s delivery quantity equals the quantity of
calibrating oil emerging from the test nozzle
(10), the plunger remains in its center posi-

tion. If the flow of calibrating oil is greater, the
plunger moves to the left – if the flow of cali-
brating oil is lower, the plunger moves to the
right. This plunger motion controls the
amount of light traveling from an LED (3) to a
photocell (4). The electronic control circuitry
(7)recordsthisdeviationandresponds by vary-
ing the pump’s rotational speed until its deliv-
ery rate again corresponds to the quantity of
fluid emerging from the test nozzle. The control
plunger then returns to its center position. The
pump speed can be varied to measure delivery
quantity with extreme precision.

Two of these measurement cells are present
on the test bench. The computer connects all
of the test cylinders to the two measurement
cells in groups of two, proceeding sequentially
from one group to the next (multiplex opera-
tion). The main features of this test method
are: 
(cid:2) Highly precise and reproducible test results
(cid:2) Clear test results with digital display and
graphic presentation in the form of bar
graphs

(cid:2) Test record for documentation
(cid:2) Supports adjustments to compensate for

Service technology

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

Testing in-line fuel-injection
pumps

The test program for fuel-injection pumps
involves operations that are carried out with
the pump fitted to the engine in the vehicle
(system fault diagnosis) as well as those per-
formed on the pump in isolation on a test
bench or in the workshop. This latter cate-
gory involves
(cid:2) Testing the fuel-injection pump on the

pump test bench and making any necessary
adjustments

(cid:2) Repairing the fuel-injection pump/gover-

nor and subsequently resetting them on the
pump test bench

In the case of in-line fuel-injection pumps, a
distinction has to be made between those with
mechanical governors and those which are
electronically controlled. In either case, the
pump and its governor/control system are
tested in combination, as both components
must be matched to each other.

The large number and variety of in-line
fuel-injection pump designs necessitates vari-
ations in the procedures for testing and ad-
justment. The examples given below can,
therefore, only provide an idea of the full ex-
tent of workshop technology.

Adjustments made on the test bench
The adjustments made on the test bench
comprise
(cid:2) Start of delivery and cam offset for each in-

dividual pump unit

(cid:2) Delivery quantity setting and equalization

between pump units

(cid:2) Adjustment of the governor mounted on

the pump

(cid:2) Harmonization of pump and governor/

control system (overall system adjustment)

For every different pump type and size, sepa-
rate testing and repair instructions and speci-
fications are provided which are specifically
prepared for use with Bosch pump test
benches.

The pump and governor are connected to the
engine lube-oil circuit. The oil inlet connec-
tion is on the fuel-injection pump’s camshaft
housing or the pump housing. 
For each testing sequence on the test bench,
the fuel-injection pump and governor must
be topped up with lube oil. 

Testing delivery quantity
The fuel-injection pump test bench can mea-
sure the delivery quantity for each individual
cylinder (using a calibrated tube apparatus or
computer operating and display terminal, see
“Fuel-injection pump test benches”). The in-
dividual delivery quantity figures obtained
over a range of different settings must be
within defined tolerance limits. Excessive di-
vergence of individual delivery quantity fig-
ures would result in uneven running of the
engine. If any of the delivery quantity figures
are outside the specified tolerances, the pump
barrel(s) concerned must be readjusted.
There are different procedures for this de-
pending on the pump model.

Governor/control system adjustment
Governor
Testing of mechanical governors involves an
extensive range of adjustments. A dial gauge
is used to check the control-rack travel at de-
fined speeds and control-lever positions on
the fuel-injection pump test bench. The test
results must match the specified figures. If
there are excessive discrepancies, the governor
characteristics must be reset. There are a
number of ways of doing this, such as chang-
ing the spring characteristics by altering
spring tension, or by fitting new springs. 

Electronic control system
If the fuel-injection pump is electronically
controlled, it has an electromechanical actua-
tor that is operated by an electronic control
unit instead of a directly mounted governor.
That actuator moves the control rack and
thus controls the injected fuel quantity. Oth-
erwise, there is no difference in the mechani-
cal operation of the fuel-injection pump.

Service technologyy

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

261

During the tests, the control rack is held at a
specific position. The control-rack travel must
be calibrated to match the voltage signal of
the rack-travel sensor. This done by adjusting
the rack-travel sensor until its signal voltage
matches the specified signal level for the set
control-rack travel.

In the case of control-sleeve in-line fuel-in-
jection pumps, the start-of-delivery solenoid
is not connected for this test in order to be
able to obtain a defined start of delivery.

Adjustments with the pump in situ
The pump’s start of delivery setting has a ma-
jor influence on the engine’s performance
and exhaust-gas emission characteristics. The
start of delivery is set, firstly, by correct ad-
justment of the pump itself, and secondly, by
correct synchronization of the pump’s
camshaft with the engine’s timing system. For
this reason, correct mounting of the injection
pump on the engine is extremely im portant.
The start of delivery must therefore be tested
with the pump mounted on the engine in or-
der to ensure that it is correctly fitted. 

There are a number of different ways in
which this can be done depending on the
pump model. The description that follows is
for a Type RSF governor.

a tooth-shaped timing mark (Fig. 1). 
In the governor housing, there is a threaded
socket which is normally closed off by a screw
cap. When the piston that is used for calibra-
tion (usually no. 1 cylinder) is in the start-of-
delivery position, the timing mark is exactly
in line with the center of the threaded socket.
This “spy hole” in the governor housing is part
of a sliding flange.

Fitting the fuel-injection pump
Locking the camshaft
The fuel-injection pump leaves the factory
with its camshaft locked (Fig. 1a) and is
mounted on the engine when the engine’s
crankshaft is set at a defined position. The
pump lock is then removed. This tried and
tested method is economical and is adopted
increasingly widely.

Start-of-delivery timing mark
Synchronizing the fuel-injection pump with
the engine is performed with the aid of the
start-of-delivery timing marks, which have to
be brought into alignment. Those marks are
to be found on the engine as well as on the
fuel-injection pump (Fig. 2 overleaf). There
are several methods of determining the start of
delivery depending on the pump type.

Normally, the adjustments are based on the
engine’s compression stroke for cylinder no. 1
but other methods may be adopted for rea-
sons related to specific engine designs. The
engine manufacturer’s instructions must
therefore always be observed. On most diesel
engines, the start-of-delivery timing mark is
on the flywheel, the crankshaft pulley or the
vibration damper. The vibration damper is
generally mounted on the crankshaft in the
position normally occupied by the V-belt pul-
ley, and the pulley then bolted to the vibra-
tion damper. The complete assembly then
looks rather like a thick V-belt pulley with a
small flywheel.

Service technology

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

Checking static start of delivery
Checking with indicator-lamp sensor
The tooth-shaped timing mark can be located
with the aid of an optical sensor, the indica-
tor-lamp sensor (Fig. 1b), which is screwed
into the socket in governor housing. When it
is opposite the sensor, the two indicator lamps
on the sensor light up. The start of delivery in
degrees of crankshaft rotation can then 
be read off from the flywheel timing marks,
for example.

High-pressure overflow method
The start-of-delivery tester is connected to
the pressure outlet of the relevant pump barrel
(Fig. 3). The other pressure outlets are closed off.
The pressurized fuel flows through the open
inlet passage of the pump barrel and exits,
initially as a jet, into the observation vessel
(3). As the engine crankshaft rotates, the
pump plunger moves towards its top dead
center position. When it reaches the start-of-
delivery position, the pump plunger closes off
the barrel’s inlet passage. The injection jet en-
tering the observation vessel thus dwindles
and the fuel flow is reduced to a drip. The
start of delivery in degrees of crank shaft ro-
tation is read off from the timing marks.

Checking dynamic start of delivery
Checking with inductive sensor
An inductive sensor that is screwed into 
the socket in the governor housing (Fig. 1c)
supplies an electrical signal every time the
governor timing mark passes when the engine
is running. A second inductive sensor sup-
plies a signal when the engine is at top dead
center (Fig. 4). The engine analyzer, 
to which the two inductive sensors are con-
nected, uses those signals to calculate the start
of delivery and the engine speed.

Checking with a piezoelectric sensor and 
a stroboscopic timing light
A piezoelectric sensor is fixed to the high-pres-
sure delivery line for the cylinder on which
adjustment is to be based. As soon as the fuel-
injection pump delivers fuel to that cylinder,
the high-pressure delivery line expands slightly
and the piezoelectric sensor transmits an elec-
trical signal. This signal is received by an engine
analyzer which uses it to control the flashing of a
stroboscopic timing light. The timing light is
pointed at the timing marks on the engine.
When illuminated by the flashing timing light,
the flywheel timing marks appear to be station -
ary. The angular value in degrees of crankshaft
rotation can then be read off for start of delivery.

Venting
Air bubbles in the fuel impair the proper op-
eration of the fuel-injection pump or disable
it entirely. Therefore, if the system has been
temporarily out of use it should be carefully
vented before being operated again. There is
generally a vent screw on the fuel-injection
pump overflow or the fuel filter for this pur-
pose.

Lubrication
Fuel-injection pumps and governors are nor-
mally connected to the engine lube-oil circuit
as the fuel-injection pump then requires no
maintenance.

Before being used for the first time, the
fuel-injection pump and the governor must
be filled with the same type of oil that is used
in the engine. In the case of fuel-injection
pumps that are not directly connected to the
engine lube-oil circuit, the pump is filled
through the filler cap after removing the vent
flap or filter. The oil level check takes place at
the same time as the regular engine oil changes
and is performed by removing the oil check
plug on the governor. Excess oil (from leak
fuel) is then drained off or the level topped
up if required. Whenever the fuel-injection
pump is removed or the engine overhauled,

Testing helix and port-controlled distributor injection pumps

Testing helix and port-
 controlled distributor  injection
pumps
Good engine performance, high fuel econ-
omy and low emissions depend on correct
adjustment of the helix and port-controlled
distributor injection pump. This is why com-
pliance with official specifications is ab-
solutely essential during testing and adjust-
ment operations on fuel-injection pumps.

One important parameter is the start of de-

livery (in service bay), which is checked with
the pump installed. Other tests are conducted
on the test bench (in test area). In this case,
the pump must be removed from the vehicle
and mounted on the test bench. Before the
pump is removed, the engine crankshaft
should be rotated until the reference cylinder
is at TDC. The reference cylinder is usually
cylinder No. 1. This step eases subsequent as-
sembly procedures.

Test bench measurements
The test procedures described here are suit-
able for use on helix and port-controlled ax-
ial-piston distributor pumps with electronic
and mechanical control, but not with sole-
noid-controlled distributor injection pumps.

Test bench operations fall into two categories:
(cid:2) Basic adjustment and
(cid:2) Testing

The results obtained from the pump test are
entered in the test record, which also lists all
the individual test procedures. This docu-
ment also lists all specified minimum and
maximum results. The test readings must 
lie within the range defined by these two
 extremes.

A number of supplementary, special-pur-
pose test steps are needed to assess all the dif-
ferent helix and port-controlled axial-piston
distributor pumps; detailed descriptions of
every contingency, however, extend  beyond
the bounds of this chapter.

Basic adjustments
The first step is to adjust the distributor injec-
tion pump to the correct basic settings. This
entails measuring the following parameters
under defined operating conditions.

LPC adjustment
This procedure assesses the distributor
plunger lift between Bottom Dead Center
(BDC) and the start of delivery. The pump
must be connected to the test-bench fuel sup-
ply line for this test. The technician unscrews
the 6-point bolt from the central plug fitting
and then installs a test assembly with drain
tube and gauge in its place (Fig. 1, 1). 

The gauge probe rests against the distribu-

tor plunger, allowing it to measure lift. Now
the technician turns the pump’s input shaft
(4) by hand until the needle on the gauge
stops moving. The control plunger 
is now at Top Dead Center (TDC).

A supply pressure of roughly 0.5 bar
 propels the calibrating oil into the plunger
chamber behind the distributor plunger (5).
For this test, the solenoid-operated shutoff
valve (ELAB) (9) is kept energized to main-
tain it in its open position. The calibrating oil
thus flows from the plunger chamber to the
test assembly before emerging from the drain
hose.

Now the technician manually rotates the
input shaft in its normal direction of rota-
tion. The calibrating oil ceases to flow into
the plunger chamber once its inlet passage
closes. The oil remaining in the chamber con-
tinues to emerge from the drain hose. This
point in the distributor plunger’s travel marks
the start of delivery.

The lift travel between Bottom Dead Cen-
ter (BDC) and the start of delivery indicated
by the gauge can now be compared with the
setpoint value. If the reading is outside the
tolerance range, it will be necessary to dis-
mantle the pump and replace the cam mecha-
nism between cam disk and plunger. 

Supply-pump pressure
As it affects the timing device, the pressure of
the supply pump (internal pressure) must
also be tested. For this procedure, the over-
flow restrictor (7) is unscrewed and an
adapter with a connection to the pressure
gauge (8) is installed. Now the overflow re-
strictor is installed in an adapter provided in
the test assembly. This makes it possible to
test the pump’s internal chamber pressure up-
stream of the restrictor.

A plug pressed into the pressure-control
valve controls the tension on its spring to de-
termine the pump’s internal pressure. Now
the technician continues pressing the plug
into the valve until the pressure reading cor-
responds to the setpoint value.

Timing device travel
The technician removes the cover from the
timing device to gain access for installing 
a travel tester with a vernier scale (3). This
scale makes it possible to record travel in 
the timing device as a function of rotational
speed; the results can then be compared with
the setpoint values. If the measured timing
device travel does not correspond with the
setpoint values, shims must be  installed un-
der the timing spring to correct its initial
spring tension.

Adjusting the basic delivery quantity
During this procedure the fuel-injection
pump’s delivery quantity is adjusted at a con-
stant rotational speed for each of the
 following four conditions:
(cid:2) Idle (no-load)
(cid:2) Full-load
(cid:2) Full-load governor regulation and 
(cid:2) Starting 

Delivery quantities are monitored using the
MGT or KMA attachment on the fuel-injec-
tion pump test bench (refer to section on
“Fuel-injection pump test benches”). 

First, with the control lever’s full-load stop
adjusted to the correct position, the full-load
governor screw in the pump cover is adjusted
to obtain the correct full-load  delivery quan-
tity at a defined engine speed. Here, the gov-

266

Service technology

ernor adjusting screw must be turned back to
prevent the full-load stop from reducing de-
livery quantity.

The next step is to measure the delivery
quantity with the control lever against the
idle-speed stop screw. The idle-speed stop
screw must be adjusted to ensure that the
monitored delivery quantity is as specified.
The governor screw is adjusted at high
 rotational speed. The measured delivery
quantity must correspond to the specified
full-load delivery quantity.

The governor test also allows verification of
the governor’s intervention speed. The gover-
nor should respond to the specified rpm
threshold by first reducing and then  finally in-
terrupting the fuel flow. The breakaway speed
is set using the governor speed screw.

There are no simple ways to adjust the
 delivery quantity for starting. The test condi-
tions are a rotational speed of 100 rpm and
the control lever against its full-load shutoff
stop. If the measured delivery quantity is be-
low a specified level, reliable starting cannot
be guaranteed. 

Testing
Once the basic adjustment settings have been
completed, the technician can proceed to as-
sess the pump’s operation under various con-
ditions. As during the basic adjustment pro-
cedure, testing focuses on
(cid:2) Supply-pump pressure
(cid:2) Timing device travel
(cid:2) Delivery quantity curve 

The pump operates under various specific
conditions for this test series, which also
 includes a supplementary procedure.

Overflow quantity
The vane-type supply pump delivers more
fuel than the nozzles can inject. The excess
calibrating oil must flow through the over-
flow restriction valve and back to the oil tank.
It is the volume of this return flow that is
measured in this procedure. A hose is con-
nected to the overflow restriction valve; de-
pending on the selected test procedure. The
other end is then placed in a glass gauge in

the MGT assembly, or installed on a special
connection on the KMA unit. The overflow
quantity from a 10-second test period is then
converted to a delivery quantity in liters per
hour.

If the test results fail to reach the setpoint
values, this indicates wear in the vane-type
supply pump, an incorrect overflow valve or
internal leakage.

Dynamic testing of start of delivery
A diesel engine tester (such as the Bosch
ETD 019.00) allows precise adjustment of the
distributor injection pump’s delivery timing
on the engine. This unit registers 
the start of delivery along with the timing ad-
justments that occur at various engine speeds
with no need to disconnect any  
high-pressure delivery lines. 

Testing with piezo-electric sensor and
 stroboscopic timing light
The piezo-electric sensor (Fig. 2, 4) is
clamped onto the high-pressure delivery 
line leading to the reference cylinder. Here, 
it is important to ensure that the sensor is
mounted on a straight and clean section of
tubing with no bends; the sensor should also
be positioned as close as possible to the fuel-
injection pump. 

The start of delivery triggers pulses in the
fuel-injection line. These generate an electric
signal in the piezo-electric sensor. The signal
controls the light pulses generated by the tim-
ing light (5). The timing light is now aimed at
the engine’s flywheel. Each time the pump
starts delivery to the reference cylinder, the
timing light flashes, lighting up the TDC
mark on the flywheel. This allows correlation
of timing to flywheel position. The flashes oc-
cur only when delivery to the reference cylin-
der starts, producing a static image. The de-
gree markings (6) on the crankshaft or fly-
wheel show the crankshaft position relative to
the start of delivery. 

Engine speed is also indicated on the diesel

engine tester.

dead center position to the TDC mark on the
reference cylinder. It is vital to comply with
the precise specification figure for this travel
contained in the fuel-injection pump’s
datasheet. If the dial gauge reading is not
within the specification, it will be necessary to
loosen the attachment bolt on the pump
flange, turn the pump housing and repeat the
test. It is important to ensure that the cold-
start accelerator is not active during this pro-
cedure.

Measuring the idle speed
The idle speed is monitored with the engine
heated to its normal operating temperature,
and in a no-load state, using the engine tester.
The idle speed can be adjusted using the idle-
speed stop screw.

Setting start of delivery
If the results of this start-of-delivery test
 deviate from the test specifications, it will 
be necessary to change the fuel-injection
pump’s angle relative to the engine.

The first step is to switch off the engine.
Then the technician rotates the crankshaft
until the reference cylinder’s piston is at the
point at which delivery should start. The
crankshaft features a reference mark for this
operation; the mark should be aligned with
the corresponding mark on the bellhousing.
The technician now unscrews the 6-point
screw from the central plug screw. As for ba-
sic adjustment process on the test bench, the
technician now installs a dial-gauge assembly
in the opening. This is used to observe dis-
tributor plunger travel while the crankshaft is
being turned. As the crankshaft is turned
counter to its normal direction of rotation
(or in the normal direction on some engines),
the plunger retracts in the pump. The techni-
cian should stop turning the crankshaft once
the needle on the gauge stops moving. The
plunger is now at bottom dead center. Now
the dial gauge is reset to zero. The crankshaft
is then rotated in its normal direction of rota-
tion as far as the TDC mark. The dial gauge
now indicates the travel executed by the dis-
tributor plunger on its way from its bottom

Nozzle tests

The nozzle-and-holder assembly consists of
the nozzle and the holder. The holder includes
all of the required filters, springs and connec-
tions.

The nozzle affects the diesel engine’s output,
fuel economy, exhaust-gas composition and
operating refinement. This is why the nozzle
test is so important.

An important tool for assessing nozzle per-

formance is the nozzle tester.

Nozzle tester
The nozzle tester is basically a manually oper-
ated fuel-injection pump (Fig. 1). For testing, a
high-pressure delivery line (4) is used to con-
nect the nozzle-and-holder assembly (3) to
the tester. The calibrating oil is contained in a
tank (5). The required pressure is generated
using the hand lever (8). The pressure gage
(6) indicates the pressure of the calibrating
oil; a valve (7) can be used to disconnect it
from the high-pressure circuit for specific test
procedures.

The EPS100 (0684200704) nozzle tester is
specified for testing nozzles of Sizes P, R, S
and T. It conforms to the standards defined in
ISO 8984. The prescribed calibrating oil is de-
fined in ISO standard 4113. A calibration case
containing all the components is required to
calibrate inspect the nozzle tester.

This equipment provides the basic condi-
tions for reproducible, mutually compatible
test results.

Test methods
Ultrasonic cleaning is recommended for the
complete nozzle-and-holder assemblies once
they have been removed from the engine.
Cleaning is mandatory on nozzles when they
are submitted for warranty claims. 

Important: Nozzles are high-precision com-
ponents. Careful attention to cleanliness is vi-
tal for ensuring correct operation.

The next step is to inspect the assembly to
determine whether any parts of the nozzle or
holder show signs of mechanical or thermal
wear. If signs or wear are present, it will be
necessary to replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-
holder assembly.

The assessment of the nozzle’s condition pro-
ceeds in four test steps, with some variation
depending on whether the nozzles are pintle or
hole-type units.

Chatter test
The chatter test provides information on the
smoothness of action of the needle. During
injection, the needle oscillates back and forth
to generate a typical chatter. This motion en-
sures efficient dispersion of the fuel particles. 
The pressure gage should be disconnected

for this test (close valve).

Pintle nozzle
The lever on the nozzle tester is operated at a
rate of one to two strokes per second. The pres-
sure of the calibrating oil rises, ultimately
climbing beyond the nozzle’s opening pres-
sure. During the subsequent discharge, the
nozzle should produce an audible chatter; 
if it fails to do so, it should be replaced.

The pressure gage must be switched back on
for this test (valve open).

Pintle nozzle and hole-type nozzle 
with single-spring nozzle holder
The operator slowly presses the lever down-
ward, continuing until the gage needle indi-
cates the highest available pressure. At this
point, the valve opens and the nozzle starts to
discharge fuel. Pressure specifications can be
found in the “nozzles and nozzle-holder com-
ponents” catalog.

Opening pressures can be corrected by re-
placing the adjustment shim installed against
the compression spring in the nozzle holder.
This entails extracting the nozzle from the
nozzle holder. If the opening pressure is too
low, a thicker shim should be installed; the re-
sponse to excessive opening pressures is 
to install a thinner shim.

Hole-type nozzle with two-spring nozzle holder
This test method can only be used to deter-
mine the initial opening pressure on two-
spring nozzle-and-holder assemblies.

The is no provision for shim replacement
on some nozzle-and-holder assemblies. The
only available response with these units is to
replace the entire assembly.

Leak test
The pressure is set to 20 bar above the open-
ing pressure. After 10 seconds, formation of a
droplet at the injection orifice is acceptable,
provided that the droplet does not fall. 

The prescribed response to an unsuccessful
leak test is to replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-
holder assembly.

When installing a new nozzle in its holder, al-
ways observe the official torque specifica-
tions, even on hole-type nozzles.

Hole-type nozzle
The hand lever is pumped at high speed. This
produces a hum or whistling sound, depend-
ing on the nozzle type. No chatter will be pre-
sent in some ranges. Evaluation 
of chatter is difficult with hole-type nozzles.
This is why the chatter test is no longer as-
signed any particular significance as an as-
sessment tool for hole-type nozzles.

Spray pattern test
High pressures are generated during this test.
Always wear safety goggles.

The hand lever is subjected to slow and
even pressure to produce a consistent discharge
plume. The spray pattern can now be evalu-
ated. It provides information on the condition
of the injection orifices. The prescribed re-
sponse to an unsatisfactory spray pattern is to
replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-holder as-
sembly.

The pressure gage should also be switched

off for this test.

Pintle nozzle
The spray should emerge from the entire
 periphery of the injection orifice as even
 tapered plume. There should be no concen-
tration on one side (except with flatted pintle
nozzles).

Hole-type nozzle
An even tapered plume should emerge from
each injection orifice. The number of individ-
ual plumes should correspond to the number
of orifices in the nozzle.

Checking the opening pressure
Once the line pressure rises above the opening
pressure, the valve needle lifts from its seat to
expose the injection orifice(s). The specified
opening pressure is vital for correct operation
of the overall fuel-injection system.
