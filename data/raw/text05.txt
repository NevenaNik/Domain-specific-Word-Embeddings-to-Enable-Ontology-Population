The term “mechatronics” came about as 
a made-up word from mechanics and 
electronics, where electronics means 
“hardware” and “software”, and mechan-
ics is the generic term for the disciplines 
of “mechanical engineering” and “hy-
draulics”. It is not a question of replacing 
mechanical engineering by “electronifi-
cation”, but of a synergistic approach 
and design methodology. The aim is to 
achieve a synergistic optimization of me-
chanical engineering, electronic hard-
ware and software in order to project 
more functions at lower cost, less weight 
and installation space, and better quality. 
The successful use of mechatronics in a 
problem solution is dependent upon an 
overall examination of disciplines that 
were previously kept separate. 

Mechatronic systems  
and components 

Applications
Mechatronic systems and components are 
now present throughout almost the entire 
vehicle: starting with engine-management 
systems and injection systems for gasoline 
and diesel engines to transmission control 
systems, electrical and thermal energy 
management systems, through to a wide 
variety of brake and driving dynamics sys-
tems. It even includes communication and 
information systems, with many different 
requirements when it comes to operability. 
Besides systems and components, mecha-
tronics are also playing an increasingly 
 vital role in the field of micromechanics.

Examples at system level
A general trend is emerging in the further 
development of systems for fully automatic 
vehicle handling and steering: more and 
more mechanical systems will be replaced 
by “X-by-wire” systems in future.

A system that was implemented long ago is 
the “Drive-by-wire” system, i.e. electronic 
throttle control. 

“Brake-by-wire” replaces the hydrome-
chanical connection between the brake 
pedal and the wheel brake. Sensors record 
the driver’s braking request and transmit 
this information to an electronic control 
unit. The unit then generates the required 
braking effect at the wheels by means of 
actuators. 

One implementation option for  

“Brake-by-wire” is the electrohydraulic 
brake (SBC, Sensotronic Brake Control). 
When the brake is operated or in the event 
of brake stabilization intervention by the 
electronic stability program (ESP), the SBC 
electronic control unit calculates the re-
quired brake pressure setpoints at the in-
dividual wheels. Since the unit calculates 
the required braking pressures separately 
for each wheel and collects the actual val-
ues separately, it can also regulate the 
brake pressure to each wheel via the 
wheel-pressure modulators. The four 
pressure modulators each consist of an 
 inlet and an outlet valve controlled by 
electronic output stages which together 
produce a finely metered pressure reg-
ulation.

Pressure generation and injection are 
 decoupled in the Common Rail System.  
A high-pressure rail, i.e. the common rail, 
serves as a high-pressure accumulator, 
constantly providing the fuel pressure re-
quired for each of the engine’s operating 
states. A solenoid-controlled injector with 
a built-in injection nozzle injects fuel di-
rectly into the combustion chamber for 
each cylinder. The engine electronics re-
quest data on accelerator pedal position, 
rotational speed, operating temperature, 
fresh-air intake flow, and rail pressure in 
order to optimize the control of fuel me-
tering as a function of the operating condi-
tions. 

Examples at component level
Fuel injectors are crucial components in 
determining the future potential of Diesel-
engine technology. Common-rail injectors 
are an excellent example of the fact that an 
extremely high degree of functionality 
and, ultimately, customer utility can only 
be achieved by controlling all the physical 
domains (electrodynamics, mechanical en-
gineering, fluid dynamics) to which these 
components are subjected.

In-vehicle CD drives are exposed to partic-
ularly tough conditions. Apart from wide 
temperature ranges, they must in particu-
lar withstand vibrations that have a critical 
impact on such precision-engineered sys-
tems. 

In order to keep vehicle vibration away 

from the actual player during mobile de-
ployment, the drives normally have a 
spring damping system. Considerations 
about reducing the weight and installation 
space of CD drives immediately raise ques-
tions concerning these spring-damper sys-
tems. In CD drives without a damper sys-
tem, the emphasis is on designing a me-
chanical system with zero clearances and 
producing additional reinforcement for 
the focus and tracking controllers at high 
frequencies. 

Only by combining both measures 
 mechatronically is it possible to achieve 
good vibration resistance in driving  
mode. As well as reducing the weight by 
approx. 15 %, the overall height is also 
 reduced by approx. 20 %.

The new mechatronic system for electri-
cally operated refrigerant motors is based 
on brushless, electronically commutated 
DC motors (BLDC’s). Initially, they are 
more expensive (motor with electronics) 
than previous DC motors equipped with 
brushes. However, the overall optimization 
approach brings benefits: BLDC motors 
can be used as “wet rotors” with a much 
simpler design. The number of separate 
parts is therefore reduced by approx. 60 %. 

4

In terms of comparable cost, this more 
 robust design doubles the service life, 
 reduces the weight by almost half and 
 reduces the overall length by approx. 40 %. 

Examples in the field of micromechanics
Another application for mechatronics is 
the area of micromechanical sensor sys-
tems, with noteworthy examples such as 
hot-film air-mass meters and yaw-rate 
 sensors. 

Because the subsystems are so closely 

coupled, microsystems design also re-
quires an interdisciplinary procedure that 
takes the individual disciplines of mechan-
ical components, electrostatics and possi-
bly fluid dynamics and electronics into 
consideration. 

Development methods

Simulation
The special challenges that designers face 
when developing mechatronic systems are 
the ever shorter development times and 
the increasing complexity of the systems. 
At the same time, it is vital to ensure that 
the developments will result in useful 
products.

Complex mechatronic systems consist of  
a large number of components from differ-
ent physical domains: hydraulic compo-
nents, mechanical components and elec-
tronic components. The interaction be-
tween these domains is a decisive factor 
governing the function and performance 
of the overall system. Simulation models 
are required to review key design deci-
sions, especially in the early development 
stages when there is no prototype avail-
able.

However, an analysis of the typical compo-
nents in mechatronic systems shows that 
they can be composed of a few simple ele-
ments specific to the domains. These stan-
dard elements are, for example: 
(cid:129)

  In the hydraulic system: throttle, valve 
or electric line 
  In the electronic system: resistor, capac-
itor or transistor 
  In the mechanical system: ground with 
friction, transmission or clutch (or the 
equivalent for micromechanics)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

The preferable solution is that these ele-
ments should be stored in a central stan-
dard model library that is also decentrally 
accessible to product development. The 
essence of the standard model library is  
a documentation of all the standard ele-
ments. For each element, this comprises: 

  Description of physical behavior in 
words
  The physical equations, parameters  
(e.g. conductivity or permeability),  
state variables (e.g. current, voltage, 
magnetic flux, pressure) and 
  The description of the associated inter-
faces 

In addition, a major part of the environ-
ment is a reference model written in a 
modeling language that is independent  
of the tool. Overall, the library includes 
reference models from the mechanical, 
 hydraulic, electronic, electrodynamic  
and software areas.

Basic issues can often be clarified by pro-
ducing relatively simple models of the 
components. If more detail is required, 
more refined component models are 
needed. The detailed models focus mainly 
on a specific physical domain:
(cid:129)

  This means that detailed hydraulic mod-
els of common rail injectors are avail-
able, for example. These can be simu-
lated using special programs with nu-
meric calculation methods that are 
exactly tailored to hydraulic systems. 
Cavitation phenomena have to be taken 
into consideration, among other things.
  Detailed models are also needed to de-
sign the power electronics that trigger 
the injector. Again, this involves the use 
of simulation tools which must be devel-
oped specifically to design electronic 
circuits.
  The development and simulation of the 
software that controls the high-pressure 
pump and the power electronics in the 
control unit with the aid of the sensor 
signals also takes place using tools that 
are specially designed for this area of 
the overall system.

(cid:129)

As the components in the overall system 
interact with each other, it is not sufficient 
to consider specific detailed models of the 
components in isolation. The optimum so-
lution is also to take into account the mod-
els of other system components. In most 
cases, these components can be repre-
sented by simpler models. For example, 
the system simulation that is focussed on 
the hydraulic components only requires  
a simple model of the power electronics.

The application of various domain-specific 
simulation tools during the development 
of mechatronic systems is only efficient if 
there is some sort of support for exchang-
ing models and parameters between the 
simulation tools. The direct exchange of 
models is highly problematic due to the 
specific languages used for describing the 
models of each of the tools.

V model
The dependencies of the different product 
development phases are illustrated in the 
“V model”: from requirement analysis to 
development, implementation, testing and 
system deployment. A project passes 
through three “top-down” levels during 
the development stage:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

A requirements specification (what) must 
first be produced at each level in the form 
of specifications. This results in the design 
specification, which is drawn up on the ba-
sis of design decisions (the actual creative 
engineering work). The performance spec-
ifications describe how a requirement can 
be met. The performance specs form the 
basis for a model description which allows 
a review (i.e. validation) of the correctness 
of each design stage together with previ-
ously defined test cases. This procedure 
passes through each of three stages, and,

depending on the technologies applied, for 
each of the associated domains (mechani-
cal engineering, hydraulics, fluid dynam-
ics, electrics, electronics, and software).

Recursions at each of the design levels 
shorten the development stages signifi-
cantly. Simulations, rapid prototyping, and 
simultaneous engineering are tools that al-
low rapid verification, and they create the 
conditions for shortening product cycles.

Outlook

The major driving force behind mecha-
tronics is continuous progress in the field 
of microelectronics. Mechatronics benefits 
from computer technology in the form of 
ever more powerful integrated computers 
in standard applications. Accordingly, 
there is a huge potential for further in-
creases in safety and convenience in  
motor vehicles, accompanied by further 
reductions in exhaust emissions and fuel 
consumption. On the other hand, new

challenges are emerging with regard to  
the technical mastery of these systems.
However, future “X-by-wire” systems 

without the mechanical/hydraulic fall-
back level must also provide the pre-
scribed functionality in the event of a 
problem. The condition for their imple-
mentation is a high-reliability and high-
availability mechatronic architecture 
which requires a “simple” proof of safety. 
This affects both single components as 
well as energy and signal transmissions. 

As well as “X-by-wire” systems, driver-as-
sistance systems and the associated man/
machine interfaces represent another area 
in which the consistent implementation of 
mechatronic systems could achieve signifi-
cant progress for both users and vehicle 
manufacturers. 

The design approaches of mechatronic 
systems should strive toward continuity  
in several aspects:

  “Top-down” from system simulation, 
with the objective of overall optimiza-
tion, through to finite element simula-

    Architecture     Overview

(cid:34)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:83)(cid:70)

Over the last three decades, tremendous 
progress has been made in automotive 
engineering. Modern injection and ex-
haust-gas treatment systems drastically 
reduced pollutants in the exhaust gas, 
while occupant-protection and vehicle 
stabilization systems improved safety  
on the road. Much of this success is due 
to the introduction of electronically-con-
trolled systems. The proportion of these 
systems used in cars increased continu-
ously. The requirements of safety and 
 environmental compatibility, but also  
the demand for comfort and convenience 
functions, will increase yet further and 
this will in no small part be achieved 
through the use of electronics. Up to 
around 90 % of innovations in the motor 
vehicle will be realized by electronics 
and microprocessor-controlled systems. 
The networking of these electronics cre-
ates the prerequisite for having this wide 
variety of electronic systems integrated 
within the complete vehicle system to 
form a whole. However, this results in  
a complexity that can only be overcome 
at considerable expense.

Overview

History
The on-board electrical network of a car 
around the year 1950 comprised approx. 
40 lines. Essentially, cables were only re-
quired for the battery, starter, ignition and 
the lighting and signaling systems. 

With the first electronic injection and 
 ignition systems, cabling complexity began 
to increase fast. Sensors fitted in the en-
gine compartment (e.g. speed sensor, 
 engine-temperature sensor) had to deliver 
signals to the engine control unit, while 
the fuel injectors required their triggering 
signals from the electronic control unit. 

A further increase in cabling complexity 

resulted from the introduction and rapid 
widespread adoption of the antilock brake 
system (ABS). Meanwhile, comfort and 
convenience systems, e.g. electrical power-
window units, would also form part of the 
standard equipment. All these systems re-
quire additional connecting lines for the 
connection of sensors, control elements 
and actuators to the control unit.

Technology of the present day
In the 1990s the cabling work in a luxury 
class vehicle amounted to around 3 km. 
This figure clearly demonstrates how 
 complex the vehicle system has become. 
The growth of the proportion of electron-
ics in the motor vehicle (Fig. 1) can mainly 
be attributed to the growth in microelec-
tronics and sensor technology. 

At first, many of the new systems were 

integrated into the vehicle by means of 
their own dedicated electronic control 
unit. For the most part, the individual 
 electronic control units operated in mutual 
independence. All the same, connecting 
lines became increasingly necessary be-
tween electronic control units to enable 
the exchange of data by means of PWM 
signals, for example. Depending on the 
 vehicle class, there are between 20 and  
80 electronic control units fitted in today’s 
vehicles. They control such equipment as 
the engine, antilock brake system or the 
airbags. The number of microcontrollers 
in the vehicle has therefore risen continu-
ously in recent years (Fig. 2).

The components of the individual sys-
tems are optimally matched to each other. 
The systems may originate from different 
manufacturers that use previously agreed, 
albeit still their own, interfaces. The rain 
sensor, for example, “speaks” in a different 
way to the sensors for the engine manage-
ment. The following example demon-
strates just how networked the functions 
in a modern vehicle are: the radar sensor 
of the adaptive cruise control system 
(ACC) measures the distance to the vehicle 
traveling in front. If this distance is shorter 
than a specified minimum distance, the 
ACC electronic control unit sends this in-
formation to the engine management, the 
ESP electronic control unit and the airbag 
electronic control unit. The engine man-
agement reduces torque and thus driving 
speed. If this is not sufficient, the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP) must also 
generate brake pressure to decelerate  
the vehicle. If the distance continues to 

shorten, the airbag and seat-belt preten-
sioners are set to emergency standby.
The communication between the elec-
tronic control units cannot take more than 
fractions of a second. The more electronic 
control units interact in the one complete 
system, the more difficult it becomes for 
them to communicate undisturbed.

With the number of electronic control 
units and the associated need for mutual 
communication, the costs of developing 
the systems rose as did the adaptation 
costs for making interfaces compatible. 
With the CAN bus (Controller Area Net-
work) developed by Bosch, a powerful and 
widely used data bus system has become 
commonplace in vehicles for the first time. 
The data line of the CAN bus makes it pos-
sible for the electronic control units to 
 exchange specific and relevant items of 
 information with each other. At the start,  
the network only comprised a few elec-
tronic control units, such as the engine-
management system, the electronic stabil-
ity program and the transmission control. 
Gradually, further systems would expand 
this network, especially in the areas of 
comfort and convenience and infotain-
ment. The CAN bus has gradually evolved 
into the standard for networking systems 
in the motor vehicle. Today it is the stan-
dard for communication between elec-

   Architecture     Overview

tronic control units within different areas 
of the electronics (drivetrain, suspension, 
body electronics and infotainment) and 
forms a powerful backbone for networking 
these areas with each other. Additional bus 
systems (e.g. LIN bus, MOST bus) are used 
as subbuses or for transmitting at high 
data rates with comparatively low realtime 
requirements in the motor vehicle.

Development trends
The proportion of electrics and electronics 
in the motor vehicle will continue to in-
crease. In the drivetrain, the number of 
components in the exhaust line (e.g. ex-
haust-gas sensors) is increasing due to 
stricter exhaust-emissions legislation. 
While the demands for reductions in fuel 
consumption can, for example, be fulfilled 
by means of new valve-gear concepts, even 
this requires additional electronic compo-
nents. A further increase in the proportion 
of electronics results mainly from the 
growth of electronic systems in the areas 
of safety, comfort and convenience, and 
 infotainment. 

Objectives
Drivers demand a high level of reliability 
from a car. The vehicle manufacturer and 
the supplier of assemblies, meanwhile,  
are constrained by other requirements 
such as minimization of manufacturing 
costs, space restrictions and the weight  
of components. An opportunity to fulfill 
these requirements in the face of the in-
creasing complexity of the “vehicle” sys-
tem is seen in the shift of the traditional 
implementation technologies of mechan-
ics, hydraulics and electrics towards 
 microprocessor-controlled, electronic 
 systems. For this reason, the development 
of software will continue to gain in impor-
tance in future.

The current situation in the electrical 
and electronic architecture of motor vehi-
cles is characterized by an increase in 
functionality and an increasingly strained 
costs situation. To achieve both of these 

objectives simultaneously, development 
partners are more frequently tapping into 
resources that are already available in sub-
systems. These can be sensors or actuators 
as well as realized functions that are avail-
able to different systems over the commu-
nications network. For new systems and 
functions, manufacturers strive to get by 
on a minimum of additional resources.  
In the meantime, engineers are faced with 
a new challenge in the form of "networked" 
thinking and subsystem integration, espe-
cially when the assemblies for the subsys-
tems originate from different development 
partners (suppliers).

Complaints in the field (i.e. with series-
production vehicles) due to electrical or 
electronic failures could be the conse-
quence of not having taken the interac-
tions of the subsystems into consideration. 
The causes – unmanageable behavior of 
functionality spread among networked 
systems, and their integration – are avoid-
able through the logical application of cer-
tified development processes as early as  
in the specification phase. Furthermore, 
modeling and tools for authoring a formal 
description of architectures are gaining 
ever more in importance.

Broadened requirements for a complete 
motor vehicle system in the future are 
leading to increased networking of vehicle 
components and subsystems. In this re-
gard, new functions are being developed 
that go beyond the frontiers of traditional 
applications – and this is without addi-
tional expenditure on hardware wherever 
possible.

New development methods and technol-
ogies are required to make this achievable. 
With a top-down approach, new functions 
are viewed from the perspective of the 
complete vehicle. This means that, in ac-
cordance with the method of systems engi-
neering, functional requirements and non-
functional requirements (e.g. quality ob-
jectives, safety, costs, etc.) are set for the 
vehicle as a whole and derived as specifi-

Architecture      Overview

cations for the subordinate subsystems. 
These requirements are formulated as a 
model and can thus be used as a specifica-
tion for the subsystems and the creation  
of test cases. This is what is known as an 
“executable specification”, which makes  
it possible to prove the completeness and 
the traceability of the requirements, for 
example, or to identify the requirements 
for interaction and communication be-
tween subsystems. In this way, it is possi-
ble to form an optimized architecture for 
the complete vehicle and its subsystems 
and components. The functional relation-
ships between the complete motor vehicle 
system and the subordinate subsystems 
can be surveyed in different levels of detail 
and suitable interfaces can be defined for 
the functions. This approach supports an 
expanding networking of functions. Syner-
gies are exploited between vehicle areas 
(domains such as the drivetrain, interior, 
infotainment) that were hitherto consid-
ered in isolation and resources are spared. 
As an element of the development pro-
cess that works in the opposite direction, 
the generation of new functions from avail-
able resources and existing systems (bot-
tom up) should also be taken into consid-
eration to minimize innovation risks.  
This is how new functions are integrated 
into existing systems, for example. Exam-
ples of this approach are measures to avert 
the consequences of an accident by “pre-
paring” subsystems for an imminent crash 
(closing windows, closing the sliding sun-
roof, activating the airbag, etc.) or the as-
sistance of the driver in emergency brak-
ing situations in ESP in future. In this way, 
it is possible to reduce the number of elec-
tronic control units and counteract rising 
system costs.

characterizes the CARTRONIC® concept

Vehicle system architecture

Architecture
The architecture of a system represents  
its “construction plan”. It describes the 
structural and dynamic system character-
istics as a whole. The architecture is usu-
ally specified in a description language. 
Special draft mechanisms are used for 
 specific requirements. With architecture 
being a construction plan for different 
 realization technologies and a means of 
proving that functional and nonfunctional 
requirements have been fulfilled in the 
system draft, different views of the system 
architecture are required. Examples of this 
include: 

 (cid:129) Hardware architecture 
 (cid:129) Software architecture 
 (cid:129) Network architecture in the area of real-

ization technologies

 (cid:129) Cost and resource consumption in the 

area of economical analysis and
 (cid:129) For the area of social requirements, 

 aspects such as safety, availability and 
legal conformity

The problems that arise in the integration 
of differently structured subsystems can 
be reduced by means of an architecture.

Functional structure 
The domain of vehicle motion has the task 
of ensuring the controlled movement of 
the vehicle as well as its directional stabil-
ity. This task can be subdivided into vari-
ous levels (Fig. 3). 

The navigation level is home to the plan-
ning tools for the driving route. These are 
merely informational in nature and have 
no interventional influence on vehicle 
 motion. 

At vehicle guidance level, the decisions 
of the driver are implemented by means of 
the steering wheel and accelerator pedal 
but also various assistance systems for ve-
hicle handling (e.g. ACC, course stability

systems). At this level, the driver is able  
to overrule the assistance systems at any 
time. 

At the stability level, there are the sub-
systems that are able to correct the deci-
sions taken at handling level if these hap-
pen to be outside the range of safe refer-
ence variables (e.g. ABS, ESP). This may  
be the case when cornering or on wet road 
surfaces, for example. 

At stabilization level, correcting vari-
ables for implementation by the vehicle’s 
actuators are determined. Information 
about the environment (e.g. road condi-
tion, air temperature, rain sensor signal)  
is still required at the various levels for  
the implementation of the relevant tasks.
These tasks can be assigned to func-
tional components, which are the architec-
tural elements of the functional architec-
ture. In this way, the driver information 

functional component represents the tasks 
of the navigation level, which are to inform 
the driver of the driving route determined 
by means of a mapping system (Fig. 3). 
 Vehicle guidance represents the guidance 
level, and stability intervention the tasks 
of the stabilization level. The vehicle mo-
tion coordinator determines the correcting 
variables for the actuators, e.g. of the  
drive and electronic stability program 
(ESP), from the information input by 
 vehicle guidance and stability interven-
tion.

Figure 4 shows how the functional com-

ponents of guidance level, stabilization 
level and vehicle actuators are related in  
a hierarchical structure within vehicle 
 motion. Communication relationships 
 between the components and interactions 
with other domains, e.g. body and interior, 
are also featured in the model.

In the same way as Vehicle motion is 
 refined, these functional components 
 require further detailing until the refined 
components represent manageable, 
clearly delimited tasks that make flexible, 
modular implementation possible through 
different realization technologies. Defined 
interfaces between the components enable 
communication and the exchange of data. 
For example, the transmission control 
 issues a request through the engine-man-
agement system for a specific reduction  
in torque during a gearshift. This value is 
exchanged as a physical variable via the 
interface.

With its integration into a suitable pro-
cedural model, the functional structure is 
the starting point for subsequent stages in 
the development process.

Systematic creation of EE system  
architectures
The increasing amount of networking in 
traditional vehicle domains for the realiza-
tion of new functions can be illustrated 
 using the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) 
driver-assistance system as an example. 
Adaptive, same-lane driving is made possi-
ble by the networking of a combined 
cruise and distance control system with 
the engine-management system, brake sys-
tem, transmission and cockpit. Here, sub-
systems from the drivetrain, chassis and 
infotainment (interaction with the driver) 
domains are used to realize the new func-
tion with minimal cost.

The decision as to whether a function  
(e.g. ACC) is realized in a dedicated logic 
close to the sensor or in one of the exist-
ing, subscriber electronic control units  
has no bearing on the function itself.

Rather, the decision is affected by non-
functional requirements such as safety, 
availability, costs or resource availability. 
In addition to the functional requirements, 
these  requirements mainly determine how  
the function is realized. The “how” is de-
scribed by the architecture of the system. 
Different requirements result in different 
system architectures.

ization stages. This required a decoupled 
development process and the exploitation 
of synergies between subsystems. The de-
velopment frameworks took into consider-
ation the dependencies and interface con-
tents within the individual domains and 
with the rest of the vehicle, as is the case 
with a networked system such as ACC,  
for example.

CARTRONIC® concept
With the CARTRONIC® architecture con-
cept, all closed and open-loop control 
tasks in the vehicle have been structured 
in accordance with logical, functional 
viewpoints and modeled in the form of  
a functional architecture. Delimited func-
tions (and their dependencies) that imple-
ment specific functional requirements 
have been represented by defined archi-
tectural elements. The functional struc-
ture, i.e. the structural description, repre-
sented a hierarchical decomposition of  
the subsystems down to manageable size. 
Interactions between elements of the func-
tional structure have been described by 
communication relationships. Since the 
use of the architecture concept could have 
led to different functional structures,  
it was essential to reach agreement on  
the tasks and interfaces. It was necessary 
to choose interfaces that were based on 
physical variables and thus supported 
 aspects such as reusability and inter-
changeability. 

The motor vehicle system with all its open 
and closed-loop tasks was dismantled into 
subsystems that implement clearly defined 
tasks. These subsystems include the en-
gine management, brake system, transmis-
sion control, ACC, lighting management, 
etc. Different levels of functional structure 
detail can be assigned to the system and 
subsystem levels (Fig. 5). It was therefore 
possible to create development frame-
works for selected functional components 
and component groups on which to base 
implementation in the form of partial real-

Bosch introduced this concept to the Auto-
sar Initiative (Workpackage 10.x).

Software architecture 
The independence of the functional struc-
ture, or architecture, from the later real-
ization stage results in a decoupling of 
functionality and technology and thus 
forms the first stage of a model-based 
 development process. The functional 
structure can be used on several occasions 
and expanded as the foundation for draft-
ing system architectures. This architecture 
is characterized by architecture drivers 
(specific criteria of the architecture) that 
are essentially the product of nonfunc-
tional requirements (e.g. costs, quality, 
 reusability, relocatability).

Further precision of the development 
frameworks devised from the functional 
structure, and of their interfaces in partic-
ular, is required if it is to be possible to 
evaluate an electronic control unit for the 
relocatability of functions and the integra-
tion of software, which is a contribution  
of various participants in the project. 
While retaining the realization-indepen-
dent information from the functional 
structure – such as an agreed torque inter-
face – the frameworks are supplemented 
by realization-specific information such  
as data type, quantization, runtime prop-
erties or resource requirements.

In the same way as hardware and disci-
plines such as mechanics or hydraulics, 
software can also be classified as a realiza-
tion technology. Product-line or platform 
approaches have long been a familiar

 feature of mechanical development or pro-
duction optimization and their application 
is virtually universal. The trend towards 
software-based system solutions and im-
provements, in conjunction with the vastly 
expanding software scopes of electronic 
systems, has given rise to the demand for 
this strategy to also be transferred to soft-
ware-intensive systems.

The decisive challenge faced today is 
less to do with technical feasibility but 
more about how to develop methods fur-
ther and apply already developed methods 
and processes in product developments  
in a systematic and disciplined way, and  
to anchor them within the organization. 
The product-line approach in software de-
velopment was transferred to the motor 
vehicle domain with the participation of 
Bosch with methodological support from 
the software engineering institute (SEI). 
The method will be used systematically  
in future Bosch product generations.

Network architecture
With the spreading of open standards  
such as the CAN bus, the integration of 
functions into application-specific elec-
tronic control units, and satellites linked 
by subnetworks, network architecture has 
become the synonym for the complexity 
management of distributed systems. 
 Extensions and “attachment solutions”  
are easily integrated until the limits of 
 network capacity are reached. If these 
possibilities were to be exploited without 
checking the system draft, this would 
 result in unmanageable increases in com-
plexities and integration conflicts. Biologi-
cal systems solve these unmanageable 
complexities through specialization and 
the creation of subnetworks with new 
forms of organization. Their objectives  
are stability and the ability to survive.  
This model has, to a certain extent, 
evolved on its own in motor vehicle sys-
tems through assignment to traditional

fields of application or domains and the 
comparatively slow growth of networking 
within these domains.

reliability are fulfilled by the multiple use 
of proven standards. Autosar concerns 
 itself with all vehicle domains. 

Bus systems for the individual domains are 
becoming more specialized due to their 
plainly different requirements. With the 
CAN in the drivetrain as the point of ori-
gin, new bus systems such as the LIN sub-
bus have begun to infiltrate the area of 
body electronics or FlexRay in the case of 
safety-relevant x-by-wire systems. In the 
multimedia field, where demands for high 
data rates but low safety requirements 
prevail, bus systems such as Bluetooth 
have started to make an appearance.

Breaking through these traditional do-
mains with ever more applications leads  
to known consequences, e.g. dramatic in-
crease in complexity, high start-up costs, 
increasing integration times and costs, and 
more demanding work in customer service 
as a consequence of diagnostics no longer 
being manageable. A solution for these 
multidimensional optimization tasks has in 
the past been sought in the software field. 
In the case of technical systems in particu-
lar, the paradigm is still king, especially in 
software realizations, because the absence 
of physical boundaries supports unlimited 
growth.

Autosar Initiative
The Autosar Initiative (AUTomotive Open 
Systems ARchitecture) was founded in  
July 2003 by several vehicle manufacturers 
and suppliers – Bosch among them. Their 
global objective is the joint development  
of an open system architecture for future 
automotive applications. The aims of the 
partnership include the standardization  
of fundamental system functions (basic 
software) and function interfaces; they  
will replace the company-specific, individ-
ual solutions used to date. Model-based 
concepts and methods ought to reduce 
complexity in spite of an expanding range 
of functions. The demands for quality and 

Based on the uniform electronics plat-
form, which primarily consists of standard 
software modules, each vehicle manufac-
turer is then free to build its own specific 
content. They enable integration into the 
electronics network. These software func-
tions permit differentiation between the 
competition.

Not only does software have to conform 

to the Autosar standard. The electronic 
control units must be built in such a way 
that the Autosar software is able to run on 
them. The Autosar members are hoping 
that the new development methods yield 
such benefits as shorter development 
times and lower development costs. 

Until now, it was often the case that dedi-
cated electronic control units would be 
 developed and fitted for new functions  
(e.g. electronic transmission control, 
 antilock brake system, air conditioning). 
The number of electronic control units 
 fitted in the vehicle grew continuously; 
 today’s generation of vehicles are 
equipped with between 20 and 80 elec-
tronic control units. In future vehicle gen-
erations, it is intended that all functions  
be covered by a network of 10 to 20 elec-
tronic control units. Some of these will 
function a little like main computers that 
will bundle the important function groups 
together. These include the drivetrain, 
 suspension management system, body  
and interior and the multimedia/telematics 
domain. On data buses, sensors with inte-
grated electronics output processed and 
verified signals, while the buses carry the 
relevant control commands to actuators 
with integrated triggering electronics.

In future, new functions will often be 
able to use the existing computer architec-
ture up to its performance limit and will  
be widely realized in the form of a soft-
ware add-on. This would therefore render

Outlook
Increasingly greater demands for safety, 
reliability and availability are being placed 
on the network architecture of modern 
 vehicles. This is where energy network 
 architecture will play a key role. In the  
face of vehicle functions increasingly be-
ing realized electronically, this architec-
ture makes for a reliable supply of power 
to systems and thus forms the basis for  
the reliability and safety of future systems. 
One possible future technology is the 
transmission of power and information  
on the supply line. The following benefits 
arise from the powerline communication 
(PLC) concept used in the public grid:
 (cid:129) Weight and cost reductions as well as 

space savings from the discontinuation 
of data lines

 (cid:129) Easier retrofitting for retrofit systems 

(spare parts trade)

 (cid:129) Reduction in complexity of the wiring 
harness in respect of manufacture and 
installation

 (cid:129) Increase in system safety, especially in 
mechanically stressed zones (e.g. door, 
mirror) that are characterized by pre-
mature aging of lines and increased risk 
of failure

 (cid:129) Powerline as a redundancy path for sys-

tems relevant to safety 

 (cid:129) Simultaneous, or parallel, implementa-
tion of several bus systems or services, 
e.g. diagnostics

unnecessary the additional electronic con-
trol unit that would have been required  
today. The system only needs to be supple-
mented by the sensors and actuators re-
quired.

Software will no longer be an inevitable 
component of hardware, but will increas-
ingly become a stand-alone product.  
The first examples of business and col-
laborative models between supplier and 
manufacturer have already been put into 
practice at Bosch, e.g. in drivetrain man-
agement. 

Examples
Individually-controlled drive components 
at each of the wheels with different wheel 
positions and wheel loads permit optimum 
use of tire force potential. This results in 
increased driving dynamics and safety 
while at the same time reducing consump-
tion, wear and emissions. For this to be 
possible, all active elements in the drive-
train, suspension and steering must be 
networked.

One example of superordinate functions 
realized by networking is the ASIS (Active 
Shift Strategy) drive strategy for automatic 
transmissions in passenger cars. Based on 
the evaluation of various control elements 
(e.g. accelerator pedal) and conclusions 
drawn from the information of other sys-
tems (e.g. cornering detection from the 
wheel speeds), this strategy is able to con-
trol the gearshift in such a way as to meet 
the driver’s real-time demand for agility 
and power through selection of the appro-
priate gear. In future, the telematics will  
be able to support additional, improved 
driving strategies, e.g. through the use  
of GPS signals for transmission control  
in terms of predictive driving.

Digital technology furnishes an extensive 
array of options for open and closed-loop 
control of automotive electronic systems. 
A large number of parameters can be in-
cluded in the process to support optimal 
operation of various systems. The control 
unit receives the electrical signals from 
the sensors, evaluates them, and then 
calculates the triggering signals for the 
actuators. The control program, the 
“software”, is stored in a special memory 
and implemented by a microcontroller. 
The control unit and its components are 
referred to as hardware. The Motronic 
control unit contains all of the algo-
rithms for open and closed-loop control 
needed to govern the engine-manage-
ment processes (ignition, induction and 
mixture formation, etc.).

Operating conditions

The control unit is subjected to very  
high demands with respect to

(cid:129)  Extreme ambient temperatures  

(in normal vehicle operation from  
–40 to +60...+125  °C)

(cid:129)  Extreme temperature changes
(cid:129)  Indirect materials and supplies  

(oil, fuel etc.)

(cid:129)  The effects of moisture and
(cid:129)  Mechanical stress such as vibration  

from the engine

The control unit must operate reliably 
when the vehicle is started with a weak 
battery (e.g. cold start) and with high 
charge voltages (vehicle electrical system 
fluctuations).

Other requirements arise from the need 
for EMC (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility). 
The requirements regarding immunity to 
electromagnetic interference and limita-
tion of high-frequency interference signal 
emission are extremely stringent.

Design

The printed circuit board with the electri-
cal components (Fig. 1) is installed in a 
housing of plastic or metal. A multiple  
plug connects the control unit to the sen-
sors, actuators and electrical power sup-
ply. The high-performance driver circuits 
that provide direct control of the actuators 
are specially integrated within the housing 
to ensure effective heat transfer to the 
housing and the surrounding air.

The majority of the electrical compo-
nents are of the surface-mounted device 
technology type. This concept provides 
extremely efficient use of space in low-
weight packages. Only a few power com-
ponents and the connectors use push-
through assembly technology.

Hybrid versions combining compact 
 dimensions with extreme resistance to 
thermal attack are available for mounting 
directly on the engine.

Data processing

Input signals
In their role as peripheral components,  
the actuators and the sensors represent 
the interface between the vehicle and the 
control unit in its role as the processing 
unit. The electrical signals of the sensors 
are routed to the control unit via a wiring 
harness and the connector plug. These sig-
nals can be of the following type: 

Analog input signals
Within a given range, analog input signals 
can assume practically any voltage value. 
Examples of physical quantities which  
are available as analog measured values 
are intake-air mass, battery voltage, in-
take-manifold and boost pressure, coolant 
and intake-air temperature. They are con-
verted into digital values by an analog-
 digital converter in the microcontroller

of the control unit and used for calcula-
tions by the microcontroller CPU. The 
maximum resolution of these analog sig-
nals is 5 mV. This translates into roughly 
1,000 incremental graduations based on 
an overall measuring range of 0 to 5 V.

Digital input signals
Digital input signals only have two states. 
They are either “high” or “low” (logical 1 
and logical 0 respectively). Examples of 
digital input signals are on/off switching 
signals, or digital sensor signals such as 
the rotational-speed pulses from a Hall 
generator or a magnetoresistive sensor. 
Such signals are processed directly by  
the microcontroller.

Pulse-type input signals
The pulse-shaped input signals from 
 inductive-type sensors containing infor-
mation on rotational speed and reference 
mark are conditioned in their own control 
unit stage. Here, spurious pulses are sup-
pressed and the pulse-shaped signals 
 converted into digital rectangular signals.

Signal conditioning
Protective circuits limit the voltages of in-
put signals to levels suitable for process-
ing. Filters separate the useful signal from 
most interference signals. When neces-
sary, the signals are then amplified to the 
input voltage required by the microcon-
troller (0 to 5 V).

Signal conditioning can take place com-
pletely or partially in the sensor depend-
ing upon the sensor’s level of integration. 

Signal processing
The control unit is the switching center 
governing all of the functions and se-
quences regulated by the engine-manage-
ment system. The closed and open-loop 
control functions are executed in the mi-
crocontroller. The input signals that are 
provided by the sensors and the interfaces 
to other systems (such as the CAN bus) are 
used as input variables. and are subjected 
to a further plausibility check in the com-
puter. The control unit program supports 
generation of the output signals used to 
control the actuators.

Output signals
The microcontroller uses the output sig-
nals to control output stages that usually 
provide enough power for connecting the 
actuators directly. It is also possible to ac-
tuate certain output stage relays for con-
sumers that use up a great deal of power 
(e.g. motor fans).

The output stages are proof against 

short circuits to ground or battery voltage, 
as well as against destruction due to elec-
trical or thermal overload. Such malfunc-
tions, together with open-circuit lines or 
sensor faults are identified by the output-
stage IC as an error and reported to the 
microcontroller.

Switching signals
Actuators can be switched on and off using 
the switching signals (e.g. motor fans).

PWM signals
Digital output signals can be in the form  
of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) signals. 
These are constant-frequency rectangular 
signals with variable on-times (Fig. 2), 
 Various actuators can be moved to various 
operating positions using these signals  
(e.g. exhaust-gas recirculation valve, 
boost-pressure actuator).

Control unit-internal communication
In order to be able to support the micro-
controller in its work, the peripheral 
 components must communicate with it. 
This takes place using an address/data  
bus which, The microcontroller outputs 
the RAM address whose contents are to  
be read (for example) via the address bus. 
The data bus is then used to transmit the 
relevant data. For former automotive ap-
plications, an 8-bit bus topology sufficed. 
This meant that the data bus comprised  
8 lines which together could transmit  
256 values simultaneously. 65,536 ad-
dresses can be accessed using the 16-bit 
address bus in this system. Presently,  
more complex systems demand 16 bits,  
or even 32 bits, for the data bus. In order 
to save on pins at the components, the data 
and address buses can be combined in a 
multiplex system, i.e. addresses and data 
are dispatched through the same lines  
but offset from each other with respect  
to time.

Serial interfaces with just a single data 
line are used for data that does not have  
to transmitted extremely quickly (e.g. fault 
memory data).

EOL programming
The extensive variety of vehicle variants 
with differing control programs and data 
records, makes it imperative to have a sys-
tem which reduces the number of control 
unit types needed by a given manufac-
turer. To this end, the Flash-EPROM’s com-
plete memory area can be programmed  
at the end of production with the program 
and the variant-specific data record  
(this is the so-called End-of-Line, or EoL, 
programming). 
  Another way of reducing the type 
 diversity is to store several data variants 
(e.g. transmission variants) in the memory, 
which are then selected using coding at the 
end of the production line. This coding is 
stored in an EEPROM.

Digital modules in the  
control unit

Microcontroller
Structure
A microcontroller consists of the following 
interacting components (Fig. 1):

(cid:129)  Central processing unit (CPU): this con-

tains the control unit and the arithmetic 
and logic unit. The control unit executes 
the instructions from the program mem-
ory, whereas the arithmetic and logic 
unit performs arithmetical and logical 
operations. 

(cid:129)  Input and output devices (I/O, Input/Out-
put), which handle the exchange of data 
with peripheral devices. Peripheral de-
vices include input and output devices 
and external data storage media.

(cid:129)  Program memory, in which the operating 
program (user program) is permanently 
stored (ROM, PROM, EPROM or flash 
EPROM). 

(cid:129)

  Data memory, which is accessed for 

reading and writing (RAM). This con-
tains the data that is currently being 
processed. Non-volatile memory 
 (EEPROM) is used for data that must  
not be deleted when the supply voltage 
is switched off. 

(cid:129)  The bus system connects the individual 

elements of the microcontroller. 

(cid:129)  A clock generator (oscillator) ensures 
that all operations in the microcon-
troller take place within a defined timing 
pattern. 

(cid:129)  Logic circuits are modules with special-
ized tasks such as program interrupts. 
They are integrated in individual  
I/O units.

The chief components of a microcomputer 
are generally separate modules connected 
to one another on a printed-circuit board. 
The microprocessor within such as system 
– the CPU – is not functional on its own:  
it is always part of a microcomputer.  

In a microcomputer, however, the above-
mentioned functions are integrated on a 
silicon wafer (system-on-a-chip). This is 
not functional on its own (standalone) and 
is therefore referred to as a single chip 
 microcomputer. 

The microcontroller is used to control 
self-regulating systems such as an engine-
management system. Depending on the 
application, they may also have expansion 
modules connected to them (e.g. addi-
tional memory for data and program 
code).

The user program is fixed and is not re-

placed for different applications. This is 
the difference between a microcontroller 
system, for example, and a PC.

Programming
The only command form capable of direct 
interpretation by a microprocessor is a  
bit pattern, i.e. the binary representation 
of a number. Since, however, this form of 
instruction is not easy to work with for a 
programmer, and is therefore susceptible 
to errors, easily memorable abbreviations 
(mnemonics) are used. These are automat-
ically translated by an assembler program 
into bit patterns (machine code) that can 
be understood by the microprocessor. 
For more complex systems and pro-
grams, high-level programming languages 
such as C are needed, as otherwise it would 
be impossible to keep extensive programs 
manageable and free of errors. Such lan-
guages require sophisticated translation 
programs (compilers) which convert the 
text of the high-level language into a form 
that can be processed by the microcon-
troller.

The machine code is stored in the 
 program memory, where it remains 
 permanently. The CPU accesses these 
components via the bus system, reads  
the numerically coded commands and 
 executes then.

    Electronic control unit     Digital modules in the control unit

Semiconductor memories
Applications
Memories are used to store large volumes 
of
(cid:129)  Digital signals representing data  

(I/O data, statuses, intermediate results 
involving frequent and rapid reading 
and writing)

(cid:129)  Program code (usually permanently 

stored) and

(cid:129)  Constants (permanently stored)

Storage involves
(cid:129)  Recording (writing)
(cid:129)  Permanent retention (actual storage) 

(cid:129)  Location and retrieval (reading) of 

and

 information

Memories utilize physical effects that 
clearly and easily create and show two 
 different states (e.g. conducting/non-con-
ducting or loaded/not loaded). The infor-
mation that is to be stored must therefore 
exist in binary form, i.e. encoded as a 
 series of “yes or no” statuses (logical “1”  
or logical “0”). Such a “yes or no” unit of 
information is called a bit (binary digit).

2 Overview of semiconductor memories

Memory modules are organized on a bit or 
word basis, depending on the application. 
A “word” is a group of bits that can be pro-
cessed as a single unit. The word length is 
equal to the number of bits processed as  
a single unit. Eight bits are referred to as  
a byte.

Memories can be organized on the basis 
of different word lengths. An 8 M x 8-RAM, 
for example, has a memory capacity of  
8 million times 8 bits (64 Mbits). The data 
is organized into bytes (8 bits), making the 
memory capacity 8 Mbytes. 

Word lengths of 4, 8, 16 and 32 bits are 
common in microcontroller systems.  
The word length is one of the factors that 
determines the performance capability of 
the system. The word length that is used 
depends on the performance capability 
 requirements of the system.

The most important terms are explained 
below according to their standardized def-
initions, where applicable, or their most 
common usage (see Figure 2 for overview).

Erasable ROM 
There are also ROMs whose contents can 
be erased and reprogrammed as outlined 
below.

EPROM (Erasable PROM)
This type of erasable read-only memory 
can have its contents completely wiped  
by irradiation with UV light and can then 
be reprogrammed using a programming 
device. 

EEPROM (Electrical EPROM) 
The EEPROM (also known as E2PROM) can 
be electrically erased and reprogrammed. 
Every storage cell of an EEPROM be indi-
vidually overwritten. For that reason,  
this type of memory module can also  
be used as nonvolatile data memory  
(e.g. for learned information in engine 
management systems).

Flash EEPROM
A more sophisticated variant of the 
EPROM and EEPROM is flash EEPROM.  
In this case, electrical flash pulses are used 
to erase specific storage areas or the entire 
contents of the memory. The erased areas 
can subsequently be reprogrammed. 

The flash memory can be reprogrammed 

on a programming station. However, the 
advantage of flash EEPROM is that is can 
also be reprogrammed while still inside 
the sealed control unit. 

Flash EEPROM is used in cases where 
relatively large quantities of data need  
to be stored, but must also be modifiable 
(e.g. program memory in vehicle control 
units).

Random-access memory (RAM)
Random-access memory or RAM is a 
short-term memory that allows direct ac-
cess to any storage location. Information 
can be read/written from/to the memory 
any number of times. 

Static RAM (SRAM)
Static RAMs use bistable switching ele-
ments as the data storage cells. Their func-
tionality is similar to that of a flip-flop,  
a simple circuit with two transistors, of 
which either the one (logical “1”) or the 
other (logical “0”) conducts at any one 
time. In SRAM, the information remains 
stored until the storage cell concerned  
is addressed and overwritten, or the 
 operating voltage is switched off.  
SRAM is therefore volatile memory. 

Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Unlike SRAM, the information is stored  
as an electrical charge in the gate capacity 
of a CMOS transistor in dynamic RAM 
(DRAM). As such capacitors are suscepti-
ble to leakage, the charge is gradually lost. 
In order to retain the information, the 
charge has to be refreshed at regular 
 intervals (every few ms). 

Read-only memory 
Read-only memory (ROM) is permanent-
storage memory that allows any memory 
location to be accessed directly but – as the 
name indicates – allows the information 
only to be read and not modified. 

A ROM is nonvolatile memory, i.e. the 
 information it contains is retained even 
when the operating voltage is switched off. 
It is usually used to store program code 
(control programs) and fixed data (func-
tion tables, encoding rules, engine charac-
teristic data maps) that need to be retriev-
able at any time. The information may  
be indelibly entered in the memory by  
the manufacturer or the user by means  
of appropriate programming of specially 
prepared memories (PROMs or program-
mable ROMs).

    Electronic control unit     Control unit software

Control unit software

Real-time capability
One of the requirements on electronic sys-
tems is real-time capability. This means 
that control procedures must react to in-
put signals within an extremely short time. 
For example, a wheel that has a tendency 
to lock must be detected so quickly that 
the ABS control algorithm in the control 
unit can reduce the brake pressure via  
the hydraulic modulator quickly enough. 
Brake slip is therefore reduced before  
the wheel can lock. Engine management 
systems make considerable real-time ca-
pability demands so that crankshaft angles 
can be adhered to with extreme accuracy 
at fast engine speeds for injection and igni-
tion timing purposes.

The complexity of an electronic system 
therefore makes extremely high demands 
of the software that is developed. The soft-
ware structure is explained below on the 
basis of an example.

Software structure
The microcontroller in the control unit ex-
ecutes commands sequentially. The com-
mand code is obtained from the program 
memory. The time taken to read in and

 execute the command depends on the 
 microcontroller that is used and the clock 
frequency. The microcontrollers that are 
currently used in vehicles can execute up 
to 1 million commands per second.

Because of the limited speed at which 
the program can be executed, a software 
structure with which time-critical func-
tions can be processed with high priority 
is required.

The engine-management program has  
to react extremely quickly to signals from 
the speed sensor, which records the en-
gine speed and the crankshaft position. 
These signals arrive at short intervals that 
can be a matter of milliseconds, depending 
on the engine speed. The control unit pro-
gram has to evaluate these signals with 
high priority. Other functions such as 
reading in the engine temperature are not 
as urgent, since the physical variable only 
changes extremely slowly in this case.

Interrupt control
As soon as an event occurs that requires  
an extremely rapid response (e.g. speed 
sensor pulse), the program that is cur-
rently running must be interrupted. This 
can be done using the microcontroller’s 
 interrupt control facility. Events can trig-
ger a program execution interrupt, where-
upon the program jumps and executes  
the “interrupt routine”. When this routine 
has been executed, the program resumes 
at the point at which it was interrupted 
(Fig. 1).

An interrupt can be triggered by an ex-
ternal signal, for example. Other interrupt 
sources are timers integrated in the micro-
controller, with which timed output signals 
can be generated (e.g. ignition signal: 
 microcontroller ignition output is switched 
at a point in time that is calculated before-
hand). However, the timer can also gener-
ate internal time frames.

The control unit program reacts to several 
of these interrupts. An interrupt source 
can therefore request an interrupt while 
another interrupt routine is currently 
 being executed. Every interrupt source 
therefore has a fixed priority assigned to 
it. The priority controller decides which 
interrupt is allowed to interrupt another 
interrupt.

Tooth interrupt
The crankshaft is equipped with a pulse 
wheel (Fig. 2a) that has a certain number  
of teeth on its circumference. The teeth  
are scanned by the speed sensor. This 
 allows the crankshaft position to be re-
corded. The typical distance between  
a pair of teeth on the crankshaft sensor 
wheel is 6°. In order to determine the 
crankshaft position, the control unit pro-
gram must execute certain routines as  
each tooth is detected. At 6,000 rpm the 
detection time between two teeth is ap-
proximately 300 µs. Every command in 
these routines must be executed within  
this time. This requires a rapid response

to the speed sensor signal. For this pur-
pose, the engine-speed signal is connected 
to a microcontroller interrupt input. Every 
falling signal edge at this input interrupts 
the current calculations that are in prog-
ress and forces a branch to the interrupt 
routine. After executing the  commands in 
the interrupt routine, the program contin-
ues execution at its point of origin.

In order to perform certain operations 
the control unit program requires the time 
taken for the crankshaft to travel between 
one tooth and the next. This calculation is 
performed by an internal timer. This is a 
freewheeling 16-bit counter (Fig. 3) that 
increments at a certain rate, depending on 
the microcontroller oscillator clock cycle. 
This time frame amounts to about 0.5 µs. 
When the falling tooth flank occurs,  
the current counter status is recorded.  
The difference (and therefore the tooth 
 interval) is calculated using the stored 
counter from the previous tooth.

Example: crankshaft position calculation
The engine-management system (Motronic 
for gasoline engines, EDC for diesel en-
gines) must know the crankshaft position 
at any given point in time. This is a pre-
requisite for injecting into the right cylin-
der at the right time and ensuring that ig-
nition takes place at the calculated ignition 
angle (Motronic systems). In order to

 detect the engine position and the engine 
speed, the control unit evaluates the speed 
sensor signal (Fig. 2b).

There is gap in the crankshaft sensor 

wheel in which two teeth are missing.  
The tooth space has a defined position  
in relation to the top dead center (TDC) of 
cylinder no. 1. The control unit program 
has to synchronize itself with this tooth 
space. This is done by measuring the times 
between two consecutive falling tooth 
flanks. The time for the tooth space is 
 considerably greater than the time before 
and after the gap. Following a “short –  
long – short” sequence the last thing to  
be scanned was the falling flank of the 
 second tooth after the space.

The crankshaft has rotated by 6° for 
each falling tooth flank that has been de-
tected by the control unit program. This is 
how the control unit program knows the 
crankshaft position within this time frame.
Since cylinder no. 1 is in the tooth space 

position in the vicinity of top dead center 
(TDC) or bottom dead center (BDC), an ad-
ditional signal is required to determine the 
position. The camshaft sensor provides  
a different voltage level in both cases.  
The control unit is therefore able to 
uniquely assign the crankshaft and 
 camshaft positions. 

Combustion-synchronous interrupt
Some calculations have to be performed 
for every combustion cycle. For example, 
the ignition angle and the injection have  
to be recalculated synchronously with 
combustion for each cylinder. The pro-
gram does this by branching to the “syn-
chronization program” after certain teeth 
(Fig. 4). This interrupt takes place after 
 every 30 teeth (ignition interval) for a four-
cylinder engine, and after every 20 teeth 
for a six-cylinder engine. 

The synchronization program is fixed to 

a certain tooth position and has to be exe-
cuted with high priority. For this reason it 
is activated via an interrupt (triggered by a 
command in the tooth interrupt routine). 

Since the synchronization program runs 
over several teeth at fast engine speeds,  
it has to be interrupted by the tooth inter-
rupt. The tooth interrupt is given higher 
priority than the synchronization pro-
gram.

Ignition interrupt
The ignition output takes place within a 
certain crankshaft range, depending on 
the value from the ignition map. Since the 
specified ignition angle has to be adhered 
to exactly, the ignition output is controlled 
by an interrupt. Like the synchronization 
program, the ignition interrupt is also 
called up once per combustion cycle. 

The control unit program is aware of the 

crankshaft position in the 6° framework. 
However, this framework is not accurate 
enough for ignition angle output. For this 
reason, accurate ignition output between 
two teeth must take place as well as this 
approximate counting for the last 0 to 
6 crankshaft degrees. This is done using  
a timer (Fig. 5). Ignition angle output that 
was purely timer-controller would lead  
to an ignition angle output error at high 
engine speed dynamics.

Firstly, the ignition coil must be enabled 

for a defined time (the so-called dwell pe-
riod). In order to do this, the program cal-
culates the switch-on time by calculating

backwards from the ignition angle at which 
the ignition coil has to be switched off. 
This makes it possible to calculate the 
tooth after which the ignition coil has to  
be switched off (approximate counting  
in 6° time frame). The remaining angle 
 (detailed counting 0 to 6°) is converted  
into an output time using the current en-
gine speed. As soon as the specified tooth 
position has been reached using approxi-
mate counting, a time is loaded with the 
output value from the detailed counting. 
When this time period expires, the timer 
triggers an interrupt. The commands that 
switch on the ignition coil are programmed 
in this interrupt routine. Then the timer  
is preset to the dwell period value, which 
causes an interrupt to be triggered when 
the timer elapses, switching off the igni-
tion coil and therefore initiating ignition.

Time frame
Many control algorithms have to run 
within a certain time frame. Lambda con-
trol, for example, has to be processed 
within a fixed time frame (e.g. 10 ms) so 
that the correcting variables are calculated 
quickly enough.

Background program
All other activities that do not run in  
an  interrupt routine or a time frame are 
 processed in the background program.  
At fast engine speeds, the synchronization 
program and the tooth interrupt are called 
frequently, leaving little CPU time for the 
background program. The time taken for a 
complete run-through of the background 
program therefore increases rapidly with 
the increasing engine speed. The back-
ground program must therefore only 
 contain low-priority functions.

Software Development

A study of the current series projects  together
with the use of development  capacities
demonstrate that approximately 60% of the
time spent on ECU development has to be
devoted to creating the necessary software.
For this reason, it is absolutely  essential that
modern tools and processes be used.

Development Process
Definition of Development Process
A depiction of the development steps in the
form of a V-model (Figure 1) serves as the ba-

This model is used to detail the process steps
which facilitate implementation within a

Quality assessments are scheduled at defined

for the purpose of process monitoring:

ware and software

An essential part of the development process
is also the distinction between specification
and implementation. This separation allows
programming by contract, whereby project
teams use the software knowledge of ReUse
teams who implement the functions (e.g.
Keyword 2000 protocol) for various cus-
tomers. To this end, the project teams write
out function contracts which establish the
boundary conditions of implementation. The
scopes and levels of testing of the individual
functions are determined in the project-spe-
cific quality plan (PQSP) with the customer
requirements in mind.

Programming Guidelines
In any heterogeneous system of development
that is spread over countries and  continents, a
standardized procedure for creating software
is a vital and integral part of the time to mar-
ket process. These guidelines address the fol-
lowing points and are binding for all pro-
grammers:

(cid:2) general guidelines (terminology, vocabu-

lary, variation handling),

(cid:2) guidelines for software developments in C

(templates, structure),

(cid:2) definitions and declarations (include,

 defines, typedefs),

(cid:2) check instructions (if, for, while, break,

 return ...),

(cid:2) coding specifications and instructions

(typecast, arithmetic, pointer),

(cid:2) particular features when using variables

(alignment, address),

(cid:2) instructions on data consistency

 (preemptive), and

(cid:2) instructions on resource relief.

These guidelines also serve as a source of
knowledge for effective code configuration in
order to counteract the limitations in  relation
to memory capacity and run time in the pro-
gramming of microcontrollers.

This also includes determining the QA x F
scopes.

The PQSP is a central element of project im-
plementation and should be fully discussed
between vehicle manufacturer and supplier. It
lays down, among others things, the responsi-
bilities, the customer relationships, the devel-
opment tools, the scopes of testing and docu-
mentation, etc.

The process in the ReUse team is set out as
follows:

(cid:2) The person in charge of the project
formulates the task (if necessary,
 adoption of customer request). 
(cid:2) The function contract is drawn up

(with details of task, project, desired
date, scope, and reference documents)
and given to the ReUse teams.

(cid:2) The persons in charge of ReUse and

the project discuss the application and
establish the scopes and deadlines
 together.

(cid:2) The person in charge of ReUse decides
on the variant and version handling
and implements the task. 

(cid:2) All documents are handed over to the
person in charge of the project on
completion.

In order to ensure that the created software
can be reused to the greatest possible extent,
there are C-programming guidelines binding
an all programmers which are called up in the
relevant reviews (e.g. QA2F).

Tools for Creating Software
As well as the formal aspects such as process
and programming guidelines, it is crucially
important to ensure that the tools are  subject
to constant support in the interests of prod-
uct quality. Figure 3 provides an overview of
the tools currently used for the various devel-
opment phases. Significant  features of this
tool chain are:
(cid:2) constant support throughout the entire de-

velopment process and

(cid:2) product-specific, optimized solutions with

tools partly developed in-house.

As the wide variety of tools demonstrates, the
process involved in creating the software for
an ECU of the latest generation is highly
complex. Figure 4 provides a simplified
overview of the interplay between the indi-
vidual tools from the specification through to
the finished ECU program.

By way of example, two component parts of
the tool chain will now be explained in closer
detail:
(cid:2) Design with ASCET-SD and
(cid:2) Vehicle simulation with TCM-Simutec.

Design with ASCET-SD
ASCET-SD (Figure 5) offers the following
functions for designing software:
(cid:2) interactive creation of function

 descriptions and function models,

(cid:2) a graphical user interface,
(cid:2) support of object-oriented design, data-
flow-oriented design and state machines.

The ERCOSEK operating system is an integral
part of the development environment, and fa-
cilitates real-time simulation of the function
model.

ASCET-SD offers the following support for
the rapid prototyping of functions:
(cid:2) ASCET-SD operates as a bypass computer
for the series ECU, i.e., individual ECU
functions run on the PC, while the other
functions continue to be executed by ETC
(Figure 6).

(cid:2) The connection is established via the CAN

or the INCA probe.

The next step is the automatic C-code creation
and the creation of the corresponding data
files for the application from the models.

Vehicle simulation with TCM-Simutec
To test the functions of a transmission-
 control system in the laboratory, there is a
simulator for the vehicle and transmission
environment which provides the input  signals
for ETC. One such simulator is shown in Fig-
ure 7. 

The front panel of the simulator is
equipped with assorted rotary potentio -
meters, switches, and pushbuttons which en-
able input variables such as output speed, se-
lector-lever position, transmission
 temperature, etc., to be specified. 

The top of the simulator accommodates a
breakbox which permits access to every ECU
pin. Measuring instruments can be easily
connected to these sockets to enable, for
 example, a PWM signal of a pressure-regula-
tor output to be viewed on an oscilloscope.

The laboratory car also contains computer

cards which simulate the other ECUs in the
vehicle network (e.g. ECUs for engine man-
agement, for ABS, etc.) and also their signals.

Process and Maturity Model
A clear definition of the development process
and the corresponding implementation in the
projects are made possible by a software de-
velopment which can be evaluated with a ma-
turity model such as CMM (capture maturity
model).

Software Structure
The software structure described in closer de-
tail in the following is implemented within
the transmission-control system. This layer
model (Figure 8) comprises
(cid:2) the application software (transmission soft-
ware) with program library provided by
the vehicle manufacturer or supplier (in
this case by Bosch),
(cid:2) the operating system,
(cid:2) the component driver, and
(cid:2) the hardware.

The separation of hardware and application
software ensures that the software can be eas-
ily ported to new hardware platforms. Only
the second layer, consisting of the  operating
system and component driver (BIOS), has to
be adapted.

The contents of the individual layers will

now be broken down in the following:

The ECU hardware, the first layer of the soft-
ware layer model, consists of the microcon-
troller (here, by way of example, the
MPC555), the memory, the interfaces (SPI,
CAN and UART), and the peripheral chips
(ASICs):

Operating System
It is absolutely essential to use an OSEK-con-
forming operating system to fulfill the cur-
rent real-time demands on an ECU. The ER-
COSEK operating system from ETAS is used in
Bosch transmission control units (available
for all kinds of microcontroller).

An operating system is subdivided into
processes and tasks (Figure 9):

A process is a function which has no call or

return parameters.

A task consists of different processes and is

characterized by
(cid:2) the sequential execution of processes,
(cid:2) the allocation of processes (cid:2) task,
(cid:2) each task being assigned a priority,
(cid:2) tasks being assigned to a time base.

For task changing, there is either cooperative
scheduling or preemptive scheduling (task
management): 

Cooperative Scheduling
In the case of cooperative scheduling, 
a task can only be interrupted between two
processes by a higher-priority task (Figure 10). 

Electronic Control Units (ECUs)

35

The advantages of this procedure are low
memory requirement (register banks, stack),
simple management, and data consistency.
The disadvantages are the limited response
time (dependent on the process run time)
and the jitter over the task period. 

Preemptive Scheduling
Owing to the drawbacks of cooperative
scheduling, preemptive scheduling is used in
operating systems which operate as real-time
systems.

With this form of scheduling, a higher-pri-
ority task can interrupt a lower-priority task
at any time (Figure 11). The advantages of
this procedure are the very short response
times, the minimal jitter over the task  period,

and a response time that is not  dependent on
process implementation. The disadvantages
are increased memory  requirement (stack,
register banks) and data-consistency prob-
lems.

Mixed Scheduling
ERCOSEK offers the option of mixing both
types of scheduling in one application.
A combination of hardware and software
scheduling serves this purpose. Figure 12
shows the distribution between cooperative
and preemptive using the priorities assigned
to the tasks.

A software call starts the operating system.

It can support different application modes
(e.g. different task sets for initialization, oper-

Acquisition of Input and 
Output Variables
Access to the hardware is obtained within the
framework of the software layer model in ac-
cordance with three layers (Figure 14):
(cid:2) user layer,
(cid:2) configuration layer, and
(cid:2) hardware layer.

The first implementation example to be
 featured is access (A) via global RAM cells.
Table 1 describes the name of the RAM cell,
the signal direction (input or output), the sig-
nal type (analog, digital, frequency, or PWM),
the description, and the physical conversion.
The second example featured is access via
(B) function interfaces. Table 2 is structured
along the same lines as Table 1, but here the
global RAM cell is replaced by a function call.
The objective in the configuration layer is
to obtain independence from platform and
project in the conversion of the hardware ac-
cesses into real software. This is achieved on
the one hand by using tools which automati-
cally create the C-code for access to the hard-
ware, and on the other hand by using C-
macros which are then resolved on a proces-
sor-specific basis.

The system must also be resistant to tempera-

gained acceptance in the field of automation
technology. Table 3 lists the maximum possi-
ble data rates for different cable lengths.

Figure 16 shows the circuit-engineering
implementation of the CAN interface in an
ECU.

In the microcontroller itself, message
 handling is conducted via a dual-port RAM
(Figure 17). Since this RAM chip, as the name
suggests, can be described from two sides
(CAN transceiver and microcontroller), the
CPU workload is substantially relieved for
signal transfer.

Complete arbitration (message organization,
who sends what when) on the CAN bus is
performed automatically by the CAN trans-
ceiver. It does not require any computing
power in the microcontroller (Figure 18).
A distinction is made within CAN  messages
between standard and extended data frames
(Figures 19 and 20).

Gear Selection and Adaptive Functions
Transmission control has undergone various
phases or expansion stages within the frame-
work of development. 

The basic functions and the adaptive
 programs for shifting points and pressure
control are now standard in the field of elec-
tronic transmission control (ETC). Where
the various marques and vehicles differ is in
the different strategies employed in the auto-
matic adaptation of the transmission to the
driving style and the traffic situation. This
also represents an area of software which is
being increasingly taken up by the vehicle
manufacturer directly and which is no longer
in the hands of a supplier. The adaptive func-
tions for shifting-point control and pressure
control have already been discussed in the
chapter sections entitled Shifting-Sequence
Control and Adaptive Pressure Control.
The following text will now deal with

Bosch-specific implementations of automatic
adaptations (learn functions). The adaptive
shifting strategy determines a gear cyclically
from the driver command, the  vehicle status,
and the driving situation. It is adaptive in re-
lation to the driver type (sportiness) and also
takes into account  automatic or manual gear
preselections (tip/nudge operation, as is fa-
miliar, for  example, from Porsche Tiptronic©
or BMW Steptronic©). The complete software
package has been modeled with an object-
oriented approach for optimum reuse.

Object-Oriented Approach
Vehicle Control
As an introduction, Figure 21 shows the 1-2
US and 2-1 DS shift curves for a driving pro-
gram. 

The shift curves shown in Figure 22  extend

this system for different driving  programs
from super economy (XE) to  super sport
(XS). They clearly show that the upshift point
in the sporty driving program moves towards
higher vehicle speed or higher engine speed
and thereby achieves optimum utilization of
engine performance.

To select a shift curve using the driver type
and the total running resistance, it is necessary
for them first to be recorded and evaluated
once. The overall structure of vehicle control
shown in Figure 23 serves this purpose.

On the one hand, there are the variables
which determine the vehicle and its status:
(cid:2) transmission control panel (TCP), 
(cid:2) the transmission itself, 
(cid:2) the engine, 
(cid:2) the accelerator-pedal position, and 
(cid:2) the vehicle variables (e.g. vehicle speed,

wheel speed, etc.).

On the other hand, there are the variables
which are crucial to shifting-point selection:
(cid:2) driver type, 
(cid:2) driving situation, and 
(cid:2) driving program. 

This is made clearer with the newly
arranged graphic overall structure of gear
 selection in Figure 24. Each of these variables
is then further divided into different sub-
evaluations.

The driver-type evaluation specifies whether
the current driving style is economical or
sporty. The driver-type determination as
 featured in Figure 25 can be shown for this
purpose.

The result of the driver-type determination is
a driver-type counter (Figure 26) with an allo-
cated driving program (XE to XXS). 

Driver-type evaluation is followed by hill
recognition (based on the vehicle running
 resistance), which distinguishes between
 different types of uphill and downhill driving
with the following allocation (Figure 27):

This is followed by determination of the
 driving situation (Figure 28).

Ratio Criteria (RC)
Driver type and driving situation form one of
three ratio criteria (RC), all of which demon-
strate different functions:

RC Driver Type
RC driver type makes a gear suggestion using
a shift curve, depending on the relevant dri-
ver type. The driver thus serves as the 
ratio supplier (RS).

RC FastOff
RC FastOff prevents upshifts if FastOff has
been detected, i.e., a 
shift prevention (USP, DSP) takes place.

RC TCP
RC TCP changes the order of priority of the
ratio supplier in accordance with operation of
the transmission control panel (TCP). An RC
selection adapted to the 
shift situation (SS) 
takes place.

Summary
The following features can be summarized for
the object-oriented adaptive driving strategy:
(cid:2) cyclical determination of the gear,
(cid:2) consideration of driver command,
vehicle status, driving situation,
(cid:2) adaptive in relation to driver type

(cid:2) division into static and dynamic driving

 (sportiness),

programs,

(cid:2) automatic and manual gear preselection

(tip/nudge operation),

(cid:2) new, flexible prioritization procedure, and
(cid:2) object-oriented structure.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs)

Diagnostic Functions
As well as the actual transmission-control
functions, monitoring functions are taking up
an ever-increasing percentage of the software.
At present, approximately 30% of the soft-
ware stored in the ECU is assigned to
 diagnostics. 

Full diagnostics serves to enhance driving

safety and also with the aid of substitute
functions to increase system availability.
 Diagnostic management must make the
 following functions available:
(cid:2) management of the fault memory,
(cid:2) CARB fault management, applicable to
each individual fault code (only specific
faults alter the vehicle’s exhaust characteris-
tics and are therefore relevant to CARB),

(cid:2) filtering (time- and event-controlled),
(cid:2) requirement of measures (substitute

 functions, limp-home),

(cid:2) provision of data for the application of

 diagnostic management for each individual
fault type,

(cid:2) monitoring functions call up diagnostic

management; this therefore only has a few
calls in the task lists.

Fault Memory
The fault memory is divided into different
subsections, which are handled differently in
relation to the memory location and accord-
ing to the input of the “ignition off ” signal.

Primary Fault Memory (PFM)
The primary fault memory (PFM) exhibits
the following features:
(cid:2) saved in the non-volatile memory 

(EEPROM),

(cid:2) typically 10 memory locations,
(cid:2) contains fault code/type, environmental

Secondary Fault Memory (SFM)
The secondary fault memory (SFM) exhibits
the following features:
(cid:2) one memory location for each fault code

(only in the volatile RAM),

(cid:2) contains filters, time stamps, and assorted

(cid:2) controls the internal program run via the

flags,

flags.

Backup Fault Memory (BFM)
The backup fault memory (BFM) exhibits the
following features:
(cid:2) optional use,
(cid:2) ring memory, saved in the non-volatile

memory,

(cid:2) typically 5 to 10 memory locations,
(cid:2) contains fault entries which have been

deleted from the PFM.

Snapshot Memory
The snapshot memory is optional and con-
tains further environmental conditions for
the first PFM entry.

The entries in this fault memory can be read
out in the workshop with the diagnosis tester,
and provide important information relating
to vehicle repair.

Monitoring Functions
The following text deals with the most
 important monitoring functions in a
 transmission-control system:

Solenoid-Valve Monitoring
The following conditions apply to monitor-
ing a solenoid valve in the transmission:
(cid:2) activation in PWM mode,
(cid:2) alternatively on/off function 

(100%/0% PWM),

(cid:2) PWM with fundamental frequency 1 kHz,
(cid:2) pulse-to-no-current ratio dependent on

the supply voltage,

(cid:2) jump from approx. 95% to 100% in PWM

“on” and “off ” states,
(cid:2) general test condition: 

battery voltage ≥ threshold (7 V),

(cid:2) fault detection as per Table 4.

A further method of solenoid-valve monitor-
ing is ISIG evaluation (inductive signature).
This method serves to monitor the voltage
characteristic at the solenoid valve and evalu-
ates the drop (UISIG) which occurs when the
spool is moved (Figure 29). The objective
here is to monitor the function of the on/off
valve. Since the voltage drop is only very
small and very short (tISIG), a  special evalua-
tor circuit must be used here.

Pressure-Regulator Monitoring
The pressure regulator must be permanently
monitored because its function is crucial to
the function of the transmission.

Program-Run Check (PRC)
The program-run check (PRC) ensures that
the following incidents are detected:
(cid:2) mix-up of components,
(cid:2) double execution of code parts, and
(cid:2) skipping of code parts.

Each module or each safety-relevant code
part must have a check point at the beginning
and the end in order to ensure a correct run
with maximum high probability. The num-
bers represent the relevant module (function
or process) and range from 0 to 9. The check-
sum algorithm (MISR procedure) ensures the
sequence relationship.

Each reference (every 10, 20, and 30 ms ref-

erence) has its own enumerator and delivers
its own part answer. The last checked point in

a PRC section must be followed by a “com-
plete check” which generates the relevant
PRC part answer with the aid of correction
values. The part answers are XORed and form
the complete part answer of the PRC to the
question/answer communication. The cur-
rent question serves as the input variable into
the PRC (or, more precisely, into each of the
PRC parts), i.e., the program run is moni-
tored on a question-dependent basis. A
dummy must simulate the PRC-monitored
points during the initialization phase because
these points are not run through during ini-
tialization.

If faults occur in the PRC, i.e. are detected, an
incorrect complete part answer of the PRC is
formed, which for its part causes an incorrect
complete answer to be sent to the monitoring
module (watchdog in the external ASIC, see
also section entitled “ASIC”). This increases
its fault counter by 1 (a fault-free complete
answer results in a decrease to the minimum
fault-counter content 0). The monitoring
module shuts down the driver stages when
the fault-counter content 5 is reached and
initiates a reset at fault-counter content 7.

With the tremendous speed at which 
computer technology is advancing, the 
number of electronic systems in use is 
 increasing more and more. This growth 
is also continuing in automotive engi-
neering. However, this also means that 
the complexity of an overall system (the 
vehicle in this case) is on the increase. 
 Individual systems such as engine man-
agement have been improved over the 
last few years. However, innovations are 
mainly achieved by means of interaction 
between several individual systems.  
The individual components need to be 
networked so that the multitude of infor-
mation that is managed by the individual 
systems can also be used elsewhere 
throughout the system. Different com-
munication systems are used depending 
on requirements (e.g. transmission reli-
ability, fault tolerances, costs).

Network topology

A network is understood to be a system  
in which a group of elements can exchange 
information via a transportation medium. 
If the elements are visualized as nodes and 
the communication relationships as lines, 
a picture is created of a network where 
many nodes are related to several other 
nodes. The nodes in a communication net-
work are also often referred to as network 
subscribers or stations. 

In motor vehicles, complex control units 

such as those for the engine management 
system (Motronic or electronic diesel con-
trol, EDC), the electronic stability program 
(ESP), the transmission control system  
or the door modules can be network sub-
scribers (Fig. 1). However, a sensor with a 
conditioning circuit that merely prepares 
and digitizes a measured value can also  
act as a network subscriber and make the 
measured signals available to other net-

work subscribers. The transport medium 
via which the communication takes place 
is referred to as a bus or a data bus.

A network topology is understood to be 
the structure consisting of network nodes 
and connections. This merely shows which 
nodes are interconnected, but does not de-
pict underlying details such as the length 
of the connection. Every network sub-
scriber must have at least one connection 
to another network subscriber in order  
to participate in network communication. 
Different requirements are made of the 
network topology for a variety of commu-
nication network applications, while the 
topology determines some of the charac-
teristics of the overall network. All net-
work topologies are based on the following 
four basic topologies

  Bus topology
  Star topology
  Ring topology and 
  Mesh topology

Other structures (hybrid topologies) can 
be created by combining these basic topol-
ogies. 

Bus topology
This network topology is also referred  
to as a linear bus. The core element of a 
bus topology is a single cable to which all 
nodes are connected via short connecting 
cables (Fig. 2). This topology makes it ex-
tremely easy to add other subscribers to 
the network. Information is transmitted by 
the individual bus subscribers in the form 
of so-called messages and distributed over 
the entire bus. 

Nodes transmit and receive messages.  

If a node fails, the data that is expected 
from this node is no longer available to  
the other nodes on the network. However, 
the remaining nodes can continue to ex-
change information. However, a network 
with a bus topology fails completely if the 
main line is defective (due to a cable break, 
for example).

Star topology
The star topology consists of a main node 
(repeater, hub) to which all other nodes 
are coupled via a single connection (Fig. 3). 
A network with this topology is therefore 
easy to extend if free capacity is available 
(connections, cables).

46     Basic principles of networking  |  Network topology

In star topologies, data is exchanged be-
tween the individual node connections  
and the main node, whereby a distinction 
is made between active and passive star 
topologies. In active star topologies, the 
main node contains a computer that pro-
cesses and relays information. The perfor-
mance capability of a network is essen-
tially determined by the performance 
 capability of this computer. However,  
the main node does not have to have spe-
cial control intelligence. In passive star 
systems, it merely connects the bus lines  
of the network subscribers together.

The following applies to active and pas-
sive stars: if a network subscriber fails or  
a connecting line to the main node is de-
fective, the rest of the network continues 
to operate. However, if the main node fails 
the entire network is disabled. 

In the automotive area, star structures 
are under discussion for safety and secu-
rity systems such as brakes and steering. 
In this case, the risk of a complete network 
failure is prevented by designing the main 
node to be physically redundant. This 
means that several main nodes are used  
to which the nodes whose information is 
needed for safe operation of the vehicle 
can be connected in parallel.

Ring topology
In the ring topology, each node is con-
nected to its two neighbors. This creates  
a closed ring (Fig. 4). A distinction can  
be made between single rings and double 
rings. 

In a single ring, data transfers are uni- 
directional from one station to the next.  
The data is checked when it is received.  
If the data is not intended for this station  
it is repeated (repeater function), boosted 
and relayed to the next station. The data 
that is being transferred is therefore re-
layed from one station to the next in the 
ring until it has reached its destination or 
arrives back at its point of origin, where  
it will then be discarded.

As a soon as a station in a single ring 
fails, the data transfer is interrupted and 
the network breaks down completely.

Rings can also be set up in the form of a 
double ring (e.g. FTTI), in which the trans-
fer of data is bidirectional. In this topology, 
the failure of a station or a connection 
 between two stations can be overcome, 
since all data is still transferred to all 
 operational stations in the ring.

However, if several stations or connec-
tions fail, the possibility of a malfunction 
cannot be ruled out.

Hybrid topologies
Hybrid topologies are a combination of 
different network topologies. Examples of 
such combination are:

  Star bus topology: the hubs of several 
star networks are interconnected as a 
linear bus (Fig. 6).

  Star ring topology: the hubs of several 

star networks are connected to the main 
hub (Fig. 7). The hubs of the star net-
work are connected in the form of a ring 
in this main hub. 

Mesh topology
In a mesh topology, each node is con-
nected to one or more other nodes (Fig. 5). 
In a fully meshed network, each node is 
connected to every other node.

If a mode or connection fails it is possi-
ble for the data to be rerouted. This type  
of network therefore has a high degree of 
system stability. However, the cost of net-
working and transporting the message is 
high.

Radio networks form a type of mesh to-
pology, since the transmissions from each 
station are received by every other station 
that is within range.

A mesh topology is bus-like as far as 
 exchanging messages is concerned, and 
star-like regarding data transfers, since 
 every station receives all transmissions 
from every other station, but connection 
failures can be overcome.

Addressing
In order to make it possible to transmit 
messages via a network and evaluate the 
contents thereof, the useful data (payload) 
that is transmitted is also accompanied by 
data transfer information. This can be ex-
plicitly contained within the transmission 
or implicitly defined using preset values. 
Addressing represents important informa-
tion for data transfer information. It is 
needed in order for a message to be sent to 
the correct recipient. There are different 
ways of doing this.

Subscriber-oriented method
The data is exchanged on the basis of node 
addresses. The message sent by the trans-
mitter contains the data to be transmitted 
and also the destination node address 
(Fig. 8a). All receivers compare the trans-
mitter receiver address to their own 
 address, and only the receiver with the 
 correct address evaluates the message.

The majority of conventional communi-
cation systems (such as Ethernet) operate 
using the subscriber addressing principle.

Message-oriented method
In this method it is not the receiver node 
that is addressed, but the message itself 
(Fig. 8b). Depending on the content of  
the message, it is identified by a message 
identifier that has been predefined for  
this message type. In this method, the 
transmitter does not need to know any-
thing about the destination of the message, 
since each individual receiver node de-
cides whether or not to process the mes-
sage. Of course, the message can be re-
ceived and evaluated by several nodes.

Transmission-oriented method
Transmission characteristics can also be 
used to identify a message. If a message is 
always transmitted within a defined time 
window, it can be identified on the basis  
of this position. By way of a safeguard,  
this addressing is often combined with 
message or subscriber-oriented address-
ing.

Bus access method
A node must access the bus in order to 
transmit a message. In the bus access 
method a distinction is made between

  Predictable methods in which the bus 
access is determined by certain time- 
dependent network characteristics, 
whereby only one node can transmit  
at a time and

  Random methods whereby any node  
can attempt to transmit data if the bus 
appears to be free

In the predictable method the bus access 
right is determined before bus access.  
It can thereby be ensured that only one 
subscriber is using the bus at a time. 
 Access collisions because of simultaneous 
bus usage will be prevented if all subscrib-
ers use this method.

In the random method, the nodes can 
 simultaneously attempt to use the bus as 
soon as it appears to be free. The timing  
of the bus access is therefore random. 
There is a risk of transmission collisions 
using this method, which will require at-
tention. This can be dealt with by repeat-
ing transmissions after a collision has been 
detected (e.g. Ethernet), by giving the 
transmissions different codings (CDMA), 
controlling communication via a master or 
prioritizing message types or transmitters.

Time division multiple access (TDMA)
TDMA is a deterministic (predictive) ac-
cess method. In this case each node is as-
signed a time window in which it is allowed 
to transmit (a priori). A fixed schedule  
is therefore required for the network. 
There is not usually a main communication 
subscriber controlling the communication 
procedure. However, concepts exist in 
which in which it is possible to switch be-
tween different schedules if necessary.  
The internal clocks of the different stations 
must run extremely synchronously with 
TDMA, since the transmit windows have  
to be adhered to with extreme precision.

Master-slave
In the master-slave system, one node  
on the network operates as the master. 
This node determines the communication 
frequency by interrogating its subordinate 
nodes (slaves). A slave only replies if it is 
spoken to by the master (Fig. 9). However, 
some master-slave protocols allow a slave 
to contact a master in order to transmit a 
message (e.g. transmit information about 
the position of the power-window unit to 
the door module).

Multimaster
In a Multimaster network, several nodes 
can access the transport medium indepen-
dently without the assistance of another 
node. Bus access is uncontrolled. Every 
node can access the bus and transmit a 
message if the bus appears to be free.  
This means that each node is its own mas-
ter, and that any node can start a message 
transfer with equal status. However, this 
also means that collision detection and 
handling methods have to be in place.  
For example, this may be in the form of a 
decision-making phase with prioritization 
or delayed transmission repeats. The use 
of priority control prevents a bus conflict 
if several nodes wish to use the bus at the 
same time, since the network node that  
has high priority or wishes to transmit  
a message with high priority forces its  
way through in the event of a conflict and 
transmits its message first. Normal mes-
sage transmission resumes when the line  
is free again.

The Multimaster architecture has a posi-
tive effect on the availability of the system, 
since no individual node is in control of 
communication whose failure would lead 
to total communication breakdown.

50     Basic principles of networking  |  OSI reference model

OSI reference model

Network protocols are usually defined  
in layers, which combine properties and 
tasks. The properties of the deeper-lying 
layers are assumed in the next level up. 
This has the advantage that individual 
 layers are exchangeable, provided that  
the  interfaces that are provided between 
the layers remain unchanged.

The ISO OSI reference model (Open 

 Systems Interconnection) provides a basis 
for describing and comparing many com-
munication protocols. This was developed 
by the ISO (International Standardization 
Organization) and led to the adoption of 
international standards by ISO and IEEE 
(Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
 Engineers).

In the OSI model, data communication 

systems are depicted in different layers 
(Fig. 10). The complex task of data commu-
nication is distributed among clearly ar-

ranged functional areas (layers). Not all of 
the layers in the OSI model are needed in a 
simple communication system. Layers can 
also be combined for many applications. 
Network protocols in the automotive area 
are often divided up into

  Physical layer
  Communication layer and
  Application layer (user layer)

Physical layer
The electrical and procedural parameters 
of the physical connection between the 
network subscribers is defined in the 
physical layer. 

Signal level
In digital technology, data is represented 
by sequences of the two binary statuses,  
0 and 1. In order to transmit the data on  
a bus, these statuses must be represented 
on the transmission agent. It is particularly 
important to avoid short-circuits on the

bus when one node is transmitting a status 
of 1 and another is transmitting a status  
of 0. 

The binary statuses can be depicted in 
many different ways. The serial interface 
of the PC, for example, uses +12 V and  
-12 V, and CAN-B uses voltages of 0 V and 
5 V. The voltages of the serial interface are 
unsuitable for a bus, since short-circuits 
can occur if several subscribers wish to 
transmit conflicting binary statuses simul-
taneously.

If the coding allows one level to over-
write another, the overwriting level is re-
ferred to as dominant, and the subordinate 
level as recessive.

It is also possible to depict dominant 
and recessive levels using visual media.  
A status of 1 (recessive) then corresponds 
to e.g. dark, and a status of 0 (dominant) 
corresponds to light. In an optical fiber,  
an individual node can override all of the 
others by feeding light into the conductor.

Bit stream 
The application information cannot usu-
ally be transmitted directly. In order to 
make transmission possible, the informa-
tion is first incorporated as a payload in 
the frame of a message that contains infor-
mation to be transmitted. Since all proto-
cols have been developed in accordance 
with different requirements, the frame 
 format differs from protocol to protocol. 
The frame needs to converted into a  
bit stream to actually transmit the infor-
mation, i.e. a sequence of bits that can be 
transmitted via the transport medium as 
physical states.

Example of the UART interface
The microcontrollers that are used in 
 control units have a simple interface 
(UART, Universal Asynchronous Receiver/
Transmitter) on the chip, via which they 
can communicate with the outside world 
(e.g. with a PC). The essential features of  
a data transmission are read out via this 
interface.

If no data is being exchanged, the bus level 
is 5 V (microcontroller operating voltage, 
Fig. 11). When the start bit is transmitted 
(dominant level), the other station con-
nected to the bus (receiver) is notified  
that a data transfer is starting (Fig. 12). 
The length of the start bit determines a  
bit time that represents the basis for the 
entire data transfer. Every subsequent  
data bit has the same length. The recipro-
cal of this time corresponds to the data 
transfer rate, i.e. the number of bits that 
can be transmitted in one second in a 
 continuous data stream. All participat-
ing stations must be set to the same data 
transfer rate.

After the start bit has been received,  

the transmission of an 8-bit data word 
commences (1 byte) with the lowest signif-
icant bit (LSB, Low Significant Bit). The re-
ceiver that has synchronized itself to the 
start bit scans the data bus between each 
data bit and therefore assembles the trans-
ferred data byte. 

The eighth data bit is followed by the 
parity bit. This bit indicates whether the 
number of transmitted ones is odd or even. 
It therefore allows the receiver to perform 
a simple check for possible transmission 
errors. The sequence is completed with 
the stop bit, which is placed onto the bus

with a dominant level. The next data trans-
fer can then take place.

Control mechanisms

Communication layer
Control units can only interconnect and 
exchange data if they speak the same 
 “language”. This language determines  
the rules that are used to exchange data 
between the individual network sub-
scribers. 

The communication layer accepts data 
from the application layer, prepares it for 
transmission and forwards it to the physi-
cal layer.

The essential features of this protocol 

layer are:

  Message frame format
  Bus access control
  Message addressing
  Detection and handling of collisions
  Network node synchronization
  Checksum calculation

Application layer
The application layer consists of the appli-
cation that processes and provides the in-
formation. The application layer is the only 
protocol layer to be affected by user or 
sensor input. 

Event control
In an event-driven bus system, messages 
are transmitted as soon as an event that 
triggers the transmission of a message  
has occurred (Fig. 13a). Examples of such 
events are: 

  Pressing a button on the air conditioning 

system control panel 

  Operating the hazard warning flasher 

switch

  Incoming message that requires a reac-
tion (e.g. information from rpm sensor 
to speedometer needle motor) 

  Expiration of a fixed time period (time 
frame, e.g. 100 ms), after which mes-
sages are transmitted cyclically 

Since the stations are not synchronized 
with each other, situations where several 
stations wish to access the bus simultane-
ously are unavoidable. In order to allow

a message to be transmitted without falsifi-
cation, only one station at a time can trans-
mit data on the bus. Collision avoidance 
mechanisms are available for preventing 
or solving bus conflicts. 

If a node wishes to transmit a message 
whilst the bus is occupied, the transmis-
sion is delayed (Fig. 13b). A station that is 
ready to transmit must then wait until the 
transmission that is currently in progress 
has been completed. 

Since bus access is subsequently rene-
gotiated, the transmission may be delayed 
yet again. These delays become problem-
atic if the bus becomes overloaded by a 
large number of network subscribers that 
wish to transmit messages. In this case 
messages may be lost if the transmitter 
abandons the transmission due to exces-
sive delays.

Event-driven bus systems are suitable 
for reacting to asynchronous (unforeseen) 
events as quickly as possible. In an ideal 
case, they reduce the delay between the 
occurrence of the event and the message 
transmission (latency time) compared to 
time-driven systems. However, the latency 
time can vary considerably depending on 
the network loading.

Advantages

  High level of flexibility and capability of 
retrofitting new nodes in the network
  Good response time to asynchronous 

external events

  Bus usage depending on event fre-
quency in line with requirements

  No network loading by unused events, 
since only events that have actually 
 occurred trigger a transmission

Disadvantages

  Static bus occupancy, non-deterministic 
(i.e. not possible to prove that a message 
was transmitted at the right time)

Timer control
In the most recent developments in dy-
namic driving systems such as brakes and 
steering, an increasing number of mechan-
ical and hydraulic components are being 
replaced with electronic systems (x-by-
wire). Mechanical connections such as  
the steering column are becoming super-
fluous, and the functionality thereof is be-
ing taken over by sensors and actuators.  
The reliability, safety and failure tolerance 
requirements of these systems are ex-
tremely high. This means: 

  Messages must be received on time
  The latency time of critical messages 

must be extremely small

  The system must have a redundant 

 design

  The failure of a node must affect the rest 

of the system as little as possible and
  It must be possible to achieve a safe op-
erating status from any fault situation

X-by-wire systems require close network-
ing by the various components. The exter-
nal increase in complexity places new de-
mands on the safety, failure tolerance and 
availability of the communication system. 
The demands that are made of the elec-
tronic and network architecture therefore 
also increase. A reliable, fault-tolerant net-
work architecture is required so that data 
is transmitted with guaranteed transmis-
sion characteristics, and electronic system 
malfunctions are handled in the most effi-
cient way. 

System architectures for real-time applica-
tions meet these requirements because 
their behavior is predictable and verifiable 
because of the way in which they are con-
structed. In these protocols, time windows 
within which a node is permitted to trans-
mit are assigned to the control units in the 
communication network (nodes) during 
network planning (Fig. 14). In order to com-
ply with the time window, the nodes must 
be synchronized as precisely as possible.

  Reliable detection and isolation of 

 defective network nodes

Disadvantages

tion system must be planned in

  Good response time to asynchronous

Composability
If a communication system allows inde-
pendently developed subsystems to be 
 integrated in an overall system, it is said  
to support composability. An important 
criterion when doing this is that the prop-
erties that have been assured for the func-
tionality of a subsystem are not adversely 
affected by adding other subsystems.  
If this has been ensured, the checking  
of system functionality is restricted to 
 subsystem checking that can be carried 
out by the constructor of the subsystem.
If a communication system supports 
composability, changes can be made to a 
control unit without affecting the function-
ality of other control units. It is therefore 
not necessary to recheck the entire system 
after integrating a modified control unit –  
it is sufficient to check that the individual 
subsystems are operating reliably. Com-
posability therefore reduces the time and 
cost of integrating new subsystems. This is 
the only way to increase the complexity of 
the electronics in the vehicle.

All transmissions are processed sequen-
tially in accordance with the network plan-
ning (without collisions). Once each node 
has transmitted its message, the cycle re-
starts with the first transmitter. This makes 
it possible to determine how chronologi-
cally up-to-date the data is at any time. 
Since missing messages are detected 
immediately, time-triggered concepts are 
more reliable than event-driven systems.
If a fast data rate is required in a time-
triggered system, the time delay between 
the occurrence of an event and the trans-
mission of the data can be so small that  
the system complies with strict real-time 
requirements.

The bus can be protected from unau-
thorized access by a bus guardian. The bus 
guardian prevents a defective node from 
interfering with network communication 
by transmitting messages outside the rele-
vant transmit window.

These characteristics make it possible  
to create redundant, fault tolerant systems 
in which transmission errors can be reme-
died and faults in the network can picked 
up by network nodes that can provide the 
functionality without errors.

  Automotive networking  |  Cross-system functions

(cid:34)(cid:86)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:78)(cid:80)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:87)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:72)

Electrical and electronic systems in 
 motor vehicles are often not indepen-
dent of each other but influence and 
complement each other. For this reason, 
signal lines were used in previous injec-
tion and ignition systems in order to 
 simplify communication between these 
two systems. However, the increasing 
number of electronic systems rapidly 
 increased the demand for and the scope 
of the information that was being ex-
changed. The number of signal lines  
and plug connections that is required 
 increased accordingly, meaning that the 
technology that has so far been used was 
approaching the limit of its capability.

The solution was provided by the develop-
ment of serial bus systems, with which 
large volumes of data from different 
sources can be transferred. A serial bus 
system was first used in a vehicle in 1991, 
when the CAN bus was used in the 
 Mercedes-Benz 500E. 

The demand for additional driving 

safety, convenience, economy and stricter 
legal requirements on the environmental 
compatibility of motor vehicles can only 
be achieved with the aid of additional elec-
tronics. The number of electronic systems 
in vehicles is therefore increasing all the 
time (Fig. 2).

1 Automotive networking

Cross-system functions 

If you examine the signals that are pro-
cessed in the individual systems, it be-
comes evident that many signals are 
needed in several control units. For exam-
ple, the driving speed is evaluated in the 
electronic stability program (ESP) for the 
vehicle dynamics control, in the engine 
management for the automatic speed 
 control (cruise control) and in the car 
sound system for the speed-dependent 
volume control. 

The preparation of these variables from 
sensor signals requires computing power 
and therefore hardware and software re-
sources. It is therefore advisable for these 
variables always to be calculated in a con-
trol unit and transmitted to other control 
units via a communication network.

However, in order to implement cross-
system functions, electronic systems can 
also exchange information and therefore 
influence each other. Intelligent sensors 
are also considered to be electronic sys-
tems that prepare the sensor signal in an 
evaluation circuit and put the information 
on the data bus via a bus interface. Pre-
crash sensors detect a pending collision, 
for example; the airbag control unit then 
sends the door modules and the overhead 
control panel a request to close the windows

Another example of a system-encom-
passing function is the adaptive cruise 
control (ACC), in which the radar sensor, 
the engine management, the electronic 
stability program (ESP) and the transmis-
sion control communicate with each other. 
Distance control from the vehicle in front 
that is adapted to the flow of traffic is 
made possible in this system by means  
of engine torque adjustments, automatic 
brake system intervention and gear 
 selection. 

Coordination between the individual 
systems is therefore required for cross-
system functions. Large volumes of data 
must be exchanged to do this. As well as 
powerful components, a powerful commu-
nication system is also required, with a 
low-cost network that is suitable for auto-
motive vehicles. Special serial databus sys-
tems have been developed for this purpose. 

The use of bus systems has the following 
advantages in comparison to a solution 
that uses conventional wiring:

  Reduced costs with less weight and in-

stallation space because of fewer cables 
in the wiring harness

  Better reliability and functional reliabil-

ity due to fewer plug-in connections

  Simplification of vehicle assembly 

 during production

  Multiple use of sensor signals
  Simple connection of system compo-

nents to a bus

  Easier handling of equipment and spe-

cial equipment variants in a vehicle

Requirements for  
bus systems

Both financial (e.g. cable costs, component 
costs) and technical constraints must be 
taken into consideration when a bus sys-
tem is being selected. The most important 
technical selection criteria are explained 
in the following.

Data transfer rate
This variable specifies the volume of data 
that is transmitted during a time unit. The 
smallest unit of data is the bit, and the data 
transfer rate is usually specified in bits/sec-
onds. Alternative names for this expression 
are transfer rate, data rate or bit rate.

The required data rate is dependent on 

the application. A slower transfer rate is 
required to switch the air-conditioning 
compressor on and off than to transfer 
 audio signals, for example.

Interference immunity
Ideally, the data should be transferred 
without interference. However, this cannot 
be guaranteed in a motor vehicle because 
of electromagnetic effects. The interfer-
ence immunity requirements that are 
made depend on the safety relevance of 
the electronic systems concerned. Lesser 
requirements are made of comfort and

convenience systems than the antilock 
brake system (ABS), for example.

In order to meet these requirements, 
mechanisms that detect transmission er-
rors are incorporated in the network pro-
tocols. A simple check can be carried out 
using the parity bit, which is calculated in 
the transmitter and is transmitted together 
with the useful data. This specifies whether 
the number of 1's in the transferred byte is 
even or off. This information is checked by 
the receiver. Single errors can be detected 
using this method. 

Another method is the checksum check. 
If several data bytes are being transmitted, 
the transmitter calculates a checksum 
from the individual data bytes using a pre-
defined formula and transmits this value. 
The receiver also calculates the checksum 
of the data bytes that have been received 
and compares it with the checksum that has 
been received. If a data transmission error 
is detected, the received data is not used 
and a repeat transmission is requested.

Real-time capability
A real-time system guarantees that its re-
sults are calculated within a fixed time in-
terval. The duration of the time interval 
depends on the application. The antilock 
brake system (ABS) must react to the 
 incipient locking of a wheel within a few 
milliseconds (wheel speed reduction), 
whereas response times of 100 ms are 
 adequate for actuating the power-window 
motor. Human beings cannot perceive 
 delay periods of less than 100 ms.

Different demands are made of real-time 

behavior depending on the application: 

  Soft real-time requirement: the system 
generally adheres to the specified re-
sponse time, and if these times are occa-
sionally exceeded, it does not produce 
any serious effects (e.g. image jerking 
during picture transmission).

  Hard real-time requirement: the time 

specification must be strictly adhered  
to. If the specified response time was ex-
ceeded, the calculated result would not 
be able to be used. This can lead to seri-
ous problems in safety-critical systems. 

For example, if time allowances were ex-
ceeded in the ABS system, the incipient 
locking of the wheels would not be de-
tected soon enough and the pressure in 
the master cylinder would not be reduced 
in time. This would result in locked wheels.
The time allowances must also be strictly 
adhered to for many engine-management 
system functions. Delays in transmitting 
injection and ignition signals could lead  
to engine judder and even misfiring.  
These reactions must be avoided, since 
they represent a potential danger. Hard 
real-time requirements must therefore be 
made of these systems. 

However, this does not necessarily mean 
that the transmission of data via a bus sys-
tem also has to be subject to these hard 
real-time requirements. Adherence to  
soft real-time requirements is usually suf-
ficient. If signals from other control units 
are needed for functions (e.g. a torque re-
duction request during a shift operation), 
the bus system must transmit the data at  
a faster data transfer speed and with a 
smaller time delay so that the overall sys-
tem complies with the specified real-time 
requirements.

Number of network nodes
The maximum number of nodes to be inte-
grated varies for different areas of vehicle 
operation. The number of nodes for com-
fort and convenience systems may be high 
due to servomotor networking (e.g. seat 
adjustment) and intelligent sensors (e.g. 
rain sensors). Several identical busses can 
be used if necessary.

Automotive networking  |  Classification of bus systems     59

Classification of bus systems

Applications in the vehicle

Because of differing requirements,  
bus systems can be subdivided into  
the following classes. 

The overall vehicle system can be divided 
into four domains or functional areas from 
the point of view or electrics/electronics:

Class A

(up to 10 kBit/s.)

  Interior and
  Telematics

In the drivetrain and chassis domains,  
the emphasis is primarily on real-time 
 applications. In the interior domain, the 
main focus is on multiplex aspects in net-
working. Mainly multimedia and infotain-
ment applications are networked in the 
telematics domain.

Real-time applications
The networking of these systems makes 
considerable demands of the performance 
capability of the communication system. 
Crankshaft-synchronous processes or pro-
cesses within a fixed time frame with cycle 
times of a few milliseconds are typical.  
If the system response times are adequate 
for the task in hand, it is described as hav-
ing real-time capability (e.g. rapid ignition-
timing advance in the Motronic after a re-
quest from the traction-control system for 
reducing torque and therefore preventing 
the wheel from spinning).

  Automotive networking  |  Applications in the vehicle

Multimedia networking
Mobile communication applications com-
bine components such as

  Car sound system
  CD changer
  Navigation system
  Driver-information systems
  Telephone
  Video system
  Voice input
  Internet, E-mail
  Back-up camera

The networking of these components 
makes it possible to have a centrally lo-
cated display and control unit for several 
applications. Operating procedures can  
be standardized in this way, and status 
 information can be summarized. Driver 
distraction is therefore minimized.

A distinction must be made between con-
trol data and audio/video data in multime-
dia networking. Transfer rates of up to 
125 kBit/s are sufficient for control tasks 
(such as CD changer control), meaning that 
the low-speed CAN bus can be used, for 
example. The direct transmission of audio 
or video data requires extremely high 
transfer rates of more than 10 MBit/s.  
The MOST bus is used for this purpose,  
for example. 

The drivetrain and chassis systems are 
 assigned to class C. These require fast 
transfer rates in order to ensure the real-
time behavior that is required for these 
applications. They also make considerable 
fault tolerance demands. These require-
ments are met by the event-driven CAN 
bus with a transfer rate of 500 kBaud 
(high-speed CAN). 

Examples:

  Engine-management system (Motronic 

or electronic diesel control, EDC) 

  Transmission control
  Antilock brake systems, ABS
  Vehicle dynamics control (e.g. electronic 

stability program, ESP)

  Chassis control systems (e.g. active body 

  Support systems (e.g. adaptive cruise 

control, ABC)

control, ACC)

Multiplex applications
The multiplex application is suitable for 
controlling and regulating components in 
the body and comfort and convenience 
electronics area (class B), such as

  Displays
  Lighting
  Access authorization with anti-theft 

warning device
  Air-conditioning
  Seat and mirror adjustment
  Door module (power-window unit,  

door-mirror adjustment)

  Windshield wipers
  Headlamp adjustment

The transfer rate requirements are not  
as high for class B systems as they are for  
class C systems. For this reason, low-speed 
CAN with a transfer rate of 125 kBit/s or 
single-wire CAN with 33 kBit/s. can be used.
If the transfer rate requirements drop 
to less than 20 kBit/s, the low-cost LIN is 
more frequently used. Applications are 
mainly in the mechatronics area; examples 
being the transfer of switch information or 
the activation of actuators.

Automotive networking  |  Coupling of networks     61

Coupling of networks

The network topologies and protocols that 
are most suitable for requirements are 
used for the different applications. How-
ever, the different network protocols are 
incompatible, meaning that data cannot be 
simply exchanged between networks. 

In this case, help is provided by a gate-
way. A gateway can be compared to an in-
terpreter that receives the “data” from a 
discussion partner, translates it and passes 
it to another discussion partner. Techni-
cally speaking a gateway is a computer 
that reads in the data that is transmitted  
by the networks and converts it into an-
other format. The use of gateways there-
fore makes it possible to exchange infor-
mation between different networks. 

A central gateway (Fig. 4a) or several 
distributed gateways can be used (Fig. 4b) 
to interconnect the bus systems. All bus 
lines are routed to the central gateway.  
In the other case, one gateway connects 
two or more busses.

Examples of networked 
vehicles

Topology
The topologies of the communication net-
works can differ considerably depending 
on the vehicle equipment. Figure 5 shows 
examples of how the network can be struc-
tured for different vehicle classes. In some 
cases, different car manufacturers use dif-
ferent bus systems for communication.

Signal transmission
Signal types
A wide variety of information can be trans-
mitted in a communication network in a 
vehicle. Some examples are: 

  Engine operating conditions (e.g. engine 
temperature, engine speed, engine load) 

  Physical measurements recorded by 
sensors (e.g. outside temperature) 
  Control signals for activating servo-
motors (e.g. power-window units) 
  Control-element switch positions  

(e.g. for the windshield wiper) 

  Multimedia data (audio and video) for 

transmitting music and speech (e.g. from 
radio stations or when handsfree talk-
ing with a cellular phone) and moving 
pictures (e.g. when playing a DVD or the 
displays from a reversing camera)

Resolution
The signals must be available with a suit-
able resolution. Switch positions can 
simply be shown as a 1-bit value (0 for 
switch open, 1 for switch closed). Other 
signals such as digitized analog voltages 
from the engine-temperature sensor or 
the calculated engine speed are shown as 
1-byte or 2-byte values, for example, de-
pending on resolution requirements. One 
byte can be used to represent 256 values, 
and two bytes can be used to represent 
65, 536 values (= 256?256). The resolution 
for sensor signals with a voltage range 
of 0…5 V is approximately 20 mV with 
a 1 byte representation (= 5 V/256). A 
resolution of 5 mV requires a 10-bit data 
representation.

The conversion between the binary 
value and the physical value must be uni-
form so that the transferred signals rep-
resent the same physical value in all sys-
tems. A resolution of 30 rpm is sufficient 
for accessing the ignition map as far as 
the engine speed n is concerned. A value 
range of 0 to 255?30 rpm (= 7, 650 rpm) 
and therefore the entire speed range can 
consequently be represented by one byte 
(8 bits). An incrementation of 30 rpm is too 
little for idle-speed control, on the other 
hand. More bits are required to represent 
the signal with a higher resolution, pro-
vided that the same measuring range is 
 being recorded.

Output
In event-driven systems such as the ones 
that are primarily used in the automotive 
area, the signals can be transferred on 
the data bus when an event occurs. Ex-
amples of such events are the operation 
of switches for switching on the air-condi-
tioning system or the windshield wiper. 
Signals that represent the operating state 
of the engine, for example, are not nec-
essarily associated with an event. The 
engine temperature, which only changes 
slowly, is cyclically measured in a fixed 
time frame by the engine control unit 

(e.g. 1 second). The engine speed, on 
the other hand, can change extremely 
rapidly. The times at which the engine 
management carries out measurements 
and calculations depends on the crank-
shaft position and is performed once per 
combustion cycle. At fast engine speeds, 
this corresponds to a time interval of a 
few milliseconds, i.e. approx. 3.3 ms at an 
engine speed of 6,000 rpm for a 6-cylin-
der engine. However, not every system 
that needs the speed information for its 
control and regulation functions depends 
on this availability. The engine control 
unit therefore does not need to output the 
speed information on the data bus as soon 
as it is calculated. In this case too, data 
transmission takes place according to a 
cyclic time frame. A time frame of 10 ms 
is normal in the engine control area. This 
means that the speed information is trans-
mitted on the bus 100 times per second.

Multimedia data 
A multimedia-compatible digital bus 
 system is frequently used in luxury-class 
vehicles to transfer audio data – as an 
alternative to using analog cables. In ad-
dition to improved audio quality, a bus 
system of this type offers the advantage 
that various audio streams and the associ-
ated check commands can be transferred 
in parallel. In the automotive industry, 
the optical MOST bus (Media Oriented 
 Systems Transport) has proven successful 
as a the multimedia bus system. 

The transfer of audio signals requires 
on the one hand synchronized transfer 
between the transmitter and one or more 
receivers and on the other hand a high 
data rate. In view of the fact that data 
transfer on the MOST bus takes place syn-
chronously with a fixed clock-pulse rate, 
synchronization is already assured by its 
transfer mechanism. 

The digital transfer of CD-quality audio 
signals, i.e. with a resolution of 16 bits and a 
clock-pulse rate of 44.1 kHz, requires a con-
stant data rate of 1.35 Mbit/s for one  stereo 

64     Automotive networking  |  Examples of networked vehicles

channel. Up to 15 stereo channels can be 
transferred in parallel with the  current ver-
sion of the MOST bus (MOST25 with a total 
transfer rate of up to 24.8 Mbit/s).

Data transfer: examples
The following examples show which sig-
nals are measured and evaluated in which 
systems.

Driving speed 
The ESP control unit calculates the driving 
speed from the wheel-speed sensors. This 
variable is transmitted on the CAN-C bus 
(drive CAN). The engine-management sys-
tem needs this value for the cruise control, 
among other things, and the transmission 
control unit determines gear changes from 
the driving speed. The adaptive speed 
control (ACC, Adaptive Cruise Control) 
needs the current driving speed to calcu-
late the necessary distance from the ve-
hicle in front and use it as a setpoint value.
A gateway transmits the speed informa-
tion via another CAN bus (instrument clus-
ter CAN) to the instrument cluster, which 
displays the value via a needle instrument. 
The CAN-B bus (comfort CAN) is also 
connected to the network via the gateway. 
Some luxury class vehicles are equipped 
with dynamic seats. The padding of the 
seats is inflated depending on the speed 
and the acceleration, counteracting 
the centrifugal force of the driver. This 
increases comfort considerably when 
 cornering.

The speed information is sent to the 
Infotainment CAN via the gateway and re-
layed to the car sound system. This allows 
the volume to be adapted to the driving 
speed. The navigation system needs the 
speed to calculate the position if the GPS 
signal is missing (e.g. in a tunnel).

The diagnosis interface is directly con-

nected to the engine and transmission 
control unit via the serial K-line. All other 
control units are connected to the diag-
nosis interface via a virtual K-line that is 
simulated on the CAN bus. This allows the 

driving speed to be read out in the work-
shop via the connected diagnostic tester 
(example: the correct assignment of the 
wheel-speed sensors must be checked for 
the ABS functional test).

Engine speed
The injection and (with a gasoline engine) 
the ignition timing are output with a reso-
lution of less than 1° of the crankshaft an-
gle. In order to ensure real-time behavior, 
the crankshaft position must be recorded 
in the engine control unit. The engine-
speed sensor scans the crankshaft trigger 
wheel and relays the signal to the control 
unit, which calculates both the crankshaft 
position and the engine speed. This vari-
able is used to calculate the injection time 
and the ignition angle, for example.

The engine speed is a variable that is 
needed in many other systems. The engine 
control unit therefore outputs it on the 
data bus. The shifting points are defined 
in the transmission control unit depending 
on the speed. The engine speed is needed 
for the ASR function (acceleration slip 
control) in the Electronic Stability Program 
(ESP) – ASR intervention (torque reduc-
tion) must not make the engine stall.

As in the previous example, the engine 
speed is transmitted to the diagnosis inter-
face and the instrument cluster (display on 
the rev counter).

Turn signaling
The driver operates the turn-signal lever 
(Fig. 6, Item 1). A signal is relayed to the 
steering column control unit via a discrete 
line (2) depending on whether the driver 
is indicating a right or left turn. This may 
be a resistance-coded signal, for example. 
The control unit evaluates the signal and 
detects that the driver is indicating a left 
turn, for example. 

The comfort CAN relays this informa-
tion to the vehicle power supply control 
unit (3). The indication direction is defined 
on the basis of the received information 
(normal flash frequency, increased flash 

Automotive networking  |  Examples of networked vehicles     65

frequency in the event of bulb failure). The 
front left and rear left turn-signal lights 
are then actuated via discrete lines (4, 5). 
The vehicle power supply control unit also 
transmits the “left turn signaling” informa-
tion on the comfort CAN. The gateway (6) 
relays the information to the instrument 
cluster CAN. The indicator lamp then 
flashes on the instrument cluster (9).
If the vehicle has a trailer hitch, the in-
formation goes to the trailer-recognition 
control unit (7) via the comfort CAN. This 
actuates the turn-signal lamp on the trailer 
(8) via cables. 

Wiper stage 1
The wiper switch (Fig. 7, Item 1) transmits 
a signal via a discrete line to the steering 
column control unit (2), which evaluates 
the information (e.g. wiper stage 1). The 
control unit transmits this information on 
the comfort CAN bus. The vehicle power 
supply control unit (3) picks up the infor-
mation and relays it to the wiper motor (4) 
via the LIN bus. The vehicle power supply 
control unit acts as a gateway between the 
comfort CAN and the wiper LIN.

Load management
At low revs (idle speed) and when a con-
siderable amount of power is being used 
up by the electrical consumers that are 
switched on, the battery or alternator volt-
age can drop to a low value. The vehicle 
power supply control unit calculates the 
current status of the vehicle power supply 
from the current battery voltage, the DF 
signal from the alternator (alternator uti-
lization) and the information about heavy 
current consumers that are switched on 
with a short switch-on duration. The vehi-
cle power supply control unit requests an 
idle speed increase via the CAN bus if the 
vehicle power supply is insufficient at idle 
speed. The engine control unit implements 
the request. If this action does not solve 
the problem, the vehicle power supply 
control unit switches off specific consum-
ers such as the heated rear windshield, the 
seat heating or the heated outside mirror. 
These consumers are connected to the 
vehicle power supply control unit via dis-
crete lines.

Multimedia application
The signal sequences during the output of 
a radio signal on the amplifier is described 
in the following as an example of the trans-
fer of signals and multimedia data in a 
luxury-class vehicle infotainment system 
with MOST bus (Fig. 5b).

The functions of the vehicle infotain-
ment system are controlled via the cen-
tral operating unit, the head unit (Fig. 8, 
Item 1). In current systems, this unit usu-
ally has a screen in the instrument panel 
and a rotary/pushbutton controller in the 
center console, by means of which the user 
interacts with the system.

To output a radio station, the head unit, 

which in most systems is responsible for 
managing the audio channels of the info-
tainment system, establishes on the MOST 
bus a stereo channel of the required audio 
quality between the radio tuner (2) and the 
amplifier (3). It now tunes in the requested 
station at the radio tuner via correspond-
ing check commands and if necessary 
makes further settings. Finally, the head 
unit connects the tuner output with the 
previously created stereo channel. For the 
information to be displayed in the user 
interface, the head unit receives from the 
radio tuner corresponding data relating 

to its current reception status (the current 
station name, for example) which are up-
dated where necessary. 

At the amplifier, the head unit connects 

the stereo channel with a selected input 
and uses corresponding check commands 
to set the properties for outputting the au-
dio signal, e.g. the set volume. When all the 
settings have been made, it instructs the 
amplifier to fade in the audio signal of the 
radio signal, which is then output through 
the infotainment system’s speakers.

Before this, the head unit has if neces-

sary ensured that the output of a previ-
ously output audio signal has been faded 
out, the output of the associated device 
stopped, and the associated audio channel 
removed. 

In parallel the CAN/MOST gateway (4) 

constantly transmits the driving-speed 
data, which it receives via the comfort 
CAN, via the MOST bus to the amplifier, 
which has requested a notification for this 
information when the system was started. 
The amplifier can use the speed together 
with further vehicle information to calcu-
late additional settings for outputting the 
audio signal, e.g. adapting the volume de-
pending on the current speed.

Control of an automatic steel folding roof
Vehicles with automatic steel folding roofs 
are currently very much in vogue. These 
roofs are automatically opened and closed. 
The technical realization of this seemingly 
simple mechanical function poses a huge 
challenge for the networking of the elec-
tronics and control units.

The networking depicted in Figure 9 
shows a typical present-day mid-size ve-
hicle with the additional function of an au-
tomatic steel folding roof. At its maximum 
equipment specification, this vehicle has 
over 35 electronic control units (ECUs), 
which communicated with each other via 

four CAN buses and a further four LIN sub-
buses. In this example, a total of 13 control 
units are involved in the control of the au-
tomatic steel folding roof. The text below 
describes which functions are performed 
by the individual control units to move the 
roof.

movement of the roof are used for this 
purpose. In order to inform the driver of 
the current status while the roof is being 
opened and closed and to prevent any 
damage to the vehicle or the surroundings, 
the roof control unit receives numerous 
further parameters from other control 
units in the vehicle.

Instrument cluster
The instrument cluster receives via the 
gateway the current status from the roof 
control unit and from other participating 
control units, and informs the driver ac-
cordingly. Example: “Obstacle behind the 
vehicle! Roof movement stopped”.

Gateway
All the communication requests which are 
transmitted from one bus system to an-
other are routed via the central gateway.

Vehicle power supply control unit
The vehicle power supply control unit 
checks whether the vehicle battery has 
sufficient charge to enable the roof to be 
moved. If necessary, the driver is informed 
and no roof movement is performed.

Parking-aid assistant
Before the roof is opened, the parking-aid 
assistant monitors the area behind the 
vehicle for obstacles to ascertain whether 
there is sufficient space available to un-
fold the roof. If an obstacle is detected, 
the driver is informed and movement 
is stopped. In this event, the driver can 
decide for him-/herself whether he/she 
wishes to continue moving the roof. In 
certain cases the parking-aid assistant can 
detect something which poses no danger 
to the vehicle.

A/C control unit
All windows are automatically closed 
when the air-recirculation switch is actu-

ated. This also applies to the sliding sun-
roof, which is activated by the roof control 
unit.

Trailer control unit
The trailer control unit informs the roof 
control unit whether a trailer is hitched. If 
this is the case, opening and closing of the 
roof is disabled.

Door control units
The status of the windows and doors is 
interrogated by all four door control units 
and transmitted to the roof control unit. 
Opening or closing of the roof is only 
begun if all the doors are closed and the 
windows are in the correct positions. This 
setting is automatically corrected if the 
windows are not in the correct positions.

Comfort control unit
The comfort control unit informs the roof 
control unit of, among other things, the 
key position. Movement of the roof is en-
abled only if the correct key is inserted.

Brake control unit
The brake control unit uses sensors to 
record the wheel speeds and thereby iden-
tify whether the vehicle is moving. The 
roof control unit receives the speed infor-
mation and enables movement of the roof 
only if the vehicle is stationary.

Future areas of FlexRay application
Up to now the high-speed CAN bus (CAN 
C) has been used to network control units 
in the drivetrain and in the chassis area. In 
future X-by-wire systems, the mechanical 
connections, e.g. between steering wheel 
and front axle (steer-by-wire) or brake 
pedal and wheel brakes (brake-by-wire), 
will be replaced by electrical communica-
tion systems in conjunction with driving-
dynamics control systems.

Automotive networking  |  Examples of networked vehicles     69

Furthermore, vehicle architectures have 
up to new often used several CAN buses 
which are linked to each other via gate-
ways to distribute the high data volume. 
Future architectures will use, for a fast, 
powerful connection between several mas-
ter computers (which assume, for example, 
central functions in the safety and driver-
assistance areas), a backbone bus with a 
high data rate to which in each case sub-
buses (e.g. drivetrain CAN and sensor CAN 
in the chassis area) are connected.

The new FlexRay bus system satisfies 
the demands which will be placed in future 
on the vehicle architecture, such as, for 
example

  high data rates and guaranteed real-

time capabilities in the drive and chassis 
areas,

  large date volume in the backbone, and 
  high failure safety of safety-relevant 

 applications (e.g. X-by-wire)

through properties such as 

  high availability and redundancy by 

means of two physically independent 
channels,

  high data rates with up to 10 Mbit/s per 

channel,

and

  data transfer with guaranteed latency, 

  synchronicity of all communication 

 users by means of a global time base.

FlexRay is currently still in the develop-
ment stage, although some initial systems 
are already in volume production. The fol-
lowing example is a current approach to a 
FlexRay topology.

Excerpt from chassis domain
Concepts for global driving-dynamics 
control are being developed to facilitate 
control which is as cooperative and thus 
as effective as possible. Components of 
these concepts are ESP (Electronic Stabil-

ity Program), AFS (Active Front Steering), 
and ARC (Active Roll Control). Higher-
level driving-dynamics control controls 
the individual systems without limiting 
their functionality and prevents negative 
interactions. Figure 10 shows the intercon-
nection of these systems with bus system 
and sensors. 

The yaw sensor transmits the vehicle’s 
acceleration values and yaw rate to ESP. 
If a critical driving situation is detected 
by ESP using these data (e.g. vehicle over-
steer), situation-conditioned brake pres-
sures and engine-management interven-
tions are calculated. Higher-level global 
driving-dynamics control also evaluates 
the driver-command steering angle from 
the steering-angle sensor and calculates 
a supplementary steering angle, which is 
converted by AFS. More effective and com-
fort-enhancing control can be achieved by 
this interaction of the individual systems. 
In this way, the vehicle can, for example, 
be stabilized by a corrective steering 
movement already at a very early stage 
such that braking interventions can be 
partially or even completely avoided.

CAN bus

In 1991 the CAN bus (Controller Area 
 Network) was the first bus system to be 
 introduced to a motor vehicle in mass 
 production. It has since established itself 
as the standard system in the automotive 
sector, but the CAN bus is also commonly 
used as a field bus in automation engineer-
ing in general. In imitation of other net-
work types, such as the local area network 
(LAN), wide area network (WAN) or per-
sonal area network (PAN), this bus system 
was given the name, CAN.

Applications
The CAN bus is used in various domains in 
the motor vehicle. These domains differ in 
the requirements they demand of the net-
work. Due to the fast processes involved in 
the area of engine management, informa-
tion is required much faster here than in 
the area of comfort/convenience where  
the controlled systems are located further 
apart and as such lines are more prone

to damage. As a result of these different 
 requirements, buses with different data 
rates are used that offer an optimum cost-
benefit ratio for the field of application 
concerned. A distinction is made between 
high-speed and low-speed CAN buses.

High-speed CAN (CAN-C)
CAN-C is defined in ISO Standard 11898-2 
and operates at bit rates of 125 kBit/s to 
1 MBit/s. The data transfer is therefore 
able to meet the real-time requirements  
of the drivetrain.

CAN-C buses are used for networking 

the following systems:

for gasoline engines or EDC for diesel 
engines)

  Electronic transmission control
  Vehicle stabilization systems (e.g. ESP)

Low-speed CAN (CAN-B)
CAN-B is defined in ISO Standard 11898-3 
and operates at a bit rate of 5 to 125 kBit/s. 
For many applications in the comfort/con-
venience and body area, this speed is suffi-
cient to meet the real-time requirements 
demanded in this area. Examples of such 
applications are:

The CAN bus is finding ever more use in 
vehicle diagnostics. Here, the electronic 
control unit is connected directly to the 
CAN bus and thus receives the information 
it needs for diagnostics immediately. Pre-

vious diagnosis interfaces (e.g. KWP2000) 
are becoming less important.

Bus systems  |  CAN bus     71

Topology
Bus topology
In the development of the CAN, particular 
focus was placed on eliminating the need 
for a central control element for communi-
cation. This approach is most effectively 
supported by a bus topology in which all 
network nodes are connected to a bus and 
each node is able to receive all information 
sent on the bus. The bus topology is most 
commonly selected during the conceptual 
design of the communications system.

In addition to offering favorable electri-

cal properties, the linear bus topology  
has the advantage that the failure of one 
station would not affect the functionality 
of the data transmission system. Further-
more, additional stations can be connected 
to the system with little extra effort.

Star topology
The use of a central coupler makes it pos-
sible to build star topologies. Active as well 
as passive couplers can be used. The use  
of a star topology achieves a high level of 
flexibility in adapting to the networking 
task. 

The coupler is used to build a star topol-

ogy and simply forwards the messages to 
the individual segments. Since the signal 
transit times remain unchanged, the cir-
cuit length of the star topology is the same 
as that of a bus topology.

Data transmission system
Network nodes
A network node (Fig. 2) comprises the mi-
crocontroller for the application software, 
the CAN controller and the CAN trans-
ceiver (bus driver). The CAN controller is 
responsible for the transmit and receive 
modes. It generates the bit stream for  
data communication from the binary data 
to be transmitted and forwards it to the 
transceiver on the TxD line. This amplifies 
the signals, generates the voltage level re-
quired for differential data transfer and 
transmits the processed bit stream serially 
on the bus line (CAN_H and CAN_L). 

 Incoming messages are processed by the 
transceiver and sent to the CAN controller 
on the RxD line.

The microcontroller, which runs the ap-
plication program (e.g. Motronic), controls 
the CAN controller, prepares the data to be 
sent and evaluates the data received. 

Logic bus states and coding
CAN uses two states for communication, 
dominant and recessive, with which the 
 information bits are transmitted. The dom-
inant state represents a binary “0”, the 
 recessive a binary “1”. NRZ (Non-Return to 
Zero) is used as the encoding method for 
the data transmission. With this method, 
there is no compulsory return to zero be-
tween two transmission states of the same 
value.

When it receives messages, the  

CAN transceiver converts the signal level 
back to logical states. In the process, a 
 differential amplifier subtracts the CAN_L 
level from the CAN_H level (Fig. 3). If lines 
 become twisted, disturbance pulses (e.g. 
from the ignition system) have the same 
 effect on both lines. Differential data trans-
fer therefore makes it possible to filter out 
interference on the line.

Some transceivers also evaluate the volt-
age level on the CAN_H and CAN_L line 
separately. It would then be possible for 
operation to continue in single-line mode 
if one of the two bus lines were to fail as 
a consequence of a short-circuit or cable 
break. However, the bus subscribers would 
have to share a common ground that would 
assume the function of the failed line.

Transmission agent and bus coupling 
Two-wire line
For the CAN, any transmission agent on 
which dominant and recessive states can 
be transmitted is worthy of consideration. 
An untwisted or twisted pair of wires, de-
pending on the ambient conditions, is usu-
ally used, and the wires are either galvani-
cally coupled or decoupled. The two bus 
lines are designated CAN_H and CAN_L. 
The two-wire line supports symmetrical 
data transfer whereby the bits are sent on 
both bus lines and represented by differ-
ent voltages. This reduces sensitivity to  
in-phase interference because the interfer-
ence affects both lines equally and can be 
filtered out. Additional shielding of the 
lines reduces their own radiation emis-
sions, especially at high baud rates.

Single-wire line
The single-wire line is a means of reducing 
manufacturing costs by dispensing with 
the second line. For this to be possible, 
however, all bus subscribers must share  
a common ground that would assume the 
function of the second line. The single-
wire version of the CAN bus is therefore 
only an option for a communications sys-
tem of limited spatial dimensions.

The data transfer on the single-wire line 
is more prone to interference radiation be-
cause it is not possible to filter out distur-
bance pulses as it is with the two-wire line. 
For this reason, a higher level increase is 
required on the bus line to improve the 
signal-to-noise ratio. This in turn has a 
negative effect on interference radiation. 
The flank steepness of the bus signals 
must therefore be reduced in comparison 
to the two-wire line. This is accompanied 
by a lower data transfer rate. Conse-
quently, the single-wire line is only used 
for the low-speed CAN in the body elec-
tronics and comfort/convenience electron-
ics. Thanks to this feature, a low-speed 
CAN with two-wire line would still remain 
functional in the event of a line failure 
(CAN_H or CAN_L).

Emission limits
To permit correct evaluation of bit trans-
mission, the signal must arrive at each 
node within the bit time without interfer-
ence, and yet still at the relevant sampling 
point. Delays arise from the signal transit 
time on the data bus. The maximum per-
missible bit rate thus depends on the total 
length of the bus. ISO 11898 specifies  
the bit rate for a defined circuit length.  
The following recommendations exist for 
longer lines.

It is possible to connect at least 30 network 
nodes to the bus without the need for ad-
ditional measures.

Voltage level
The CAN transceiver converts the logical 
states 0 and 1 received by the CAN control-
ler into voltage levels that are fed to the 
CAN_H and CAN_L bus lines. 

The high-speed and low-speed CANs use 

different voltage levels for the transmis-
sion of dominant and recessive states.  
The voltage levels of the low-speed CAN 
are shown in Figure 4a, those of the high-
speed CAN in Figure 4b.

In the recessive state, the high-speed 
CAN uses a voltage of 2.5 V on both lines. 
In the dominant state, a voltage of 3.5 V is 
present on CAN_H and a voltage of 1.5 V is 
present on CAN_L.

On the low-speed CAN, a voltage of 0 V 
is present on CAN_H in the recessive state, 
and 5 V on CAN_L. In the dominant state, 
voltages of 3.6 V and 1.4 V are present on 
the CAN_H and CAN_L respectively.

Reflection-free termination
Reflections of the electrical signals at open 
ends of lines would interfere with commu-
nication. To dampen these reflections, the 
bus lines are terminated at each end with  
a resistor of 120 V. 

Alternatively, the terminating resistors 
may be integrated into the electronic con-
trol units themselves.

CAN protocol
Protocol layers
For communications protocols, it is 
 standard practice to arrange thematically 
 coherent tasks as a set of layers, which af-
fords a high level of flexibility in the imple-
mentation of a bus system. With the CAN, 
both the CAN hardware and the CAN soft-
ware are subdivided into several layers 
(Fig. 6).

Application layer
The application layer represents the infor-
mation in the form of data structures used 
by the application. These sets of data 
which are to be transmitted are forwarded 
to the object layer for this purpose.

Object layer
The task of the object layer is to manage 
the messages. The functions of this layer 
are used to decide which message should 
be sent at which time. For incoming mes-
sages, this layer is responsible for message 
filtering.

Transport layer
The transport layer furnishes the object 
layer with received messages and pro-
cesses the messages prepared by the ob-
ject layer for sending in such a way that  
the physical layer is able to transmit this

information. To fulfill this purpose, the 
transport layer is responsible for such 
functions as arbitration or fault detection 
and signaling.

Physical layer
The physical layer is the lowest level in the 
transport stack. It consists of the physical 
components of the network, such as the 
wiring and the voltages used to send the 
information.

Multimaster principle
The CAN protocol supports communica-
tion between network nodes without the 
need for a central control unit. Each node 
may attempt to send messages at any time. 
Whether this attempt is successful or not 
essentially depends on two factors:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Is the bus free before the start of trans-

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Has the arbitration phase been passed 

mission? 

successfully?

This design ensures that, even if any num-
ber of nodes were to fail, it can still be de-
termined whether a node is authorized to 
send.

Content-based addressing
Unlike other networks, the CAN does not 
address the individual network nodes but 
the messages that have been sent. Each 
message has a unique marker, or identifier. 
The identifier classifies the content of the 
message (e.g. engine speed or power-win-
dow position). A station is therefore able 
to broadcast a message to all other stations 
(multicast or broadcast method). These 
stations read only those messages whose 
identifiers are stored in their acceptance 
list (message filtering, Fig. 7). In this way, 
each station decides for itself whether or 
not it needs a message sent on the bus. 
The identifier has 11 bits (standard format, 
CAN 2.0 A) or 29 bits (extended format, 
CAN 2.0 B). With 11 bits in the standard 
format, it is possible to distinguish be-
tween 2,048 different CAN messages;  

Bus systems  |  CAN bus     75

in the extended format, this number rises 
to over 536 million.

The advantage of this addressing 

method is that the network nodes do not 
require any information about system 
 configuration and are thus free to operate 
fully independently of each other. This re-
sults in a highly flexible complete system, 
which makes it easier to manage equip-
ment variants. If one of the ECUs requires 
new information which is already on the 
bus, all it needs to do is call it up from the 
bus. It is possible to integrate additional 
stations into the system (provided they are 
receivers) without having to modify the 
 existing stations.

Controlling bus access
Arbitration phase
If the bus is unoccupied (recessive state) 
and messages are available for sending, 
each station is free to initiate the sending 
of its message. The message begins with a 
dominant bit (start-of-frame bit), followed 
by the identifier. When several stations 
start to transmit simultaneously, the sys-
tem responds by employing “wired-and” 
arbitration (arbiter = logical AND operator) 
to resolve the resulting conflicts over bus 
access. The message with the highest pri-

ority (lowest binary value of the identifier) 
is assigned first access, without any data 
loss or delay (non-destructive protocol).
The arbitration principle permits the 
dominant bits transmitted by a given sta-
tion to overwrite the recessive bits of the 
other stations (Fig. 8). Each station outputs 
the identifier of its message onto the bus 
bit by bit, with the most significant bit first. 
During this arbitration phase, each station 
wishing to send data compares the level 
present on the bus with the level it actually 
possesses. Each station that attempts to 
send a recessive bit but encounters a dom-
inant bit loses the arbitration process.  
The station with the lowest identifier, i.e. 
the highest priority, makes its way onto  
the bus without having to repeat the mes-
sage (non-destructive access control).  
The transmitters of lower-priority mes-
sages automatically become recipients of 
the message just sent by another station. 
They repeat their attempt to send as soon 
as the bus is free again. 

Without this access control, bus colli-
sions would result in faults. To guarantee 
unequivocal bus arbitration, therefore,  
it is not permissible for more than one 
node to send a message with the same 
identifier.

76     Bus systems  |  CAN bus

With this access method, maximum-pri-
ority messages only have to wait for the 
transfer of the message currently being 
sent and, with bit times of 130 (CAN 2.0 A) 
or 150 (CAN 2.0 B), they have the lowest 
latency. At a data transfer rate of  
500 kBits/s, this equates to 260 µs or  
300 µs. The higher the load on the bus,  
the greater the data transfer's temporal 
offset becomes for messages of lower pri-
ority, and thus the greater the uncertainty 
over when a message to be sent will arrive 
at the recipient.

In order that all messages have a chance 
of accessing the bus, the data transfer rate 
must be matched to the number of bus 
subscribers.

Priority assignments
The direct consequence of the arbitration 
process is that the identifier also has the 
role of prioritizing the frame during trans-
mission in addition to identifying the 
frame content. An identifier correspond-
ing to a low binary number has high prior-
ity and vice versa. Message priorities are 
derived from the speed at which the mes-
sage content changes or from the impor-
tance of the message to safety consider-
ations, for example. It must not be possible 
for messages to have the same priority.

Message format
The message transfer on the CAN bus is 
based on four different frame formats:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Data frame:  

The transmitted message contains data 
(e.g. current engine speed) that is pro-
vided by the transmitting station (data 
source).

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Remote frame:  

Stations can request the data they  
need from the data source (example:  
the windshield wiper requests how wet 
the windshield is from the rain sensor). 
The data source responds by sending 
the relevant data frame.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Error frame:  

If a station detects a fault or error, it 
communicates this to the other stations 
using an error frame.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Overload frame: 

This can be used to create a delay be-
tween a preceding and subsequent data 
frame or remote frame. The transmitting 
node reports that it cannot currently 
process another frame.

For data transfer on the data bus, a mes-
sage frame is created. It contains the infor-
mation to be transmitted arranged in a 
 defined sequence. CAN supports two dif-
ferent formats of frame, which are speci-
fied in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B. The most 
important difference between these two 
frame formats is the length of the identi-
fier. A CAN 2.0 A frame has an 11-bit iden-
tifier, while a CAN 2.0 B frame has a 29-bit 
identifier divided into two parts (11 bit 
and 18 bit).

Both formats are compatible with  
each other and can be used together in  
a network. The frames compliant with 
CAN 2.0 A and B are shown in Figure 9. 
They have a maximum length of 130 bits 
(standard format) or 150 bits (extended 
format).

Bus systems  |  CAN bus     77

In CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B data frames, 
the sequence of transferred information 
is arranged in the same way. The start-of-
frame bit is followed by the arbitration, 
control, data and CRC fields. A frame is 
completed by the ACK field and the end-
of-frame.

Start of frame
The bus is recessive in idle state. The start 
of frame, represented by a dominant bit, 
indicates the start of a transmission and, 
together with the process of bit stuffing, 
serves to synchronize all stations.

Arbitration field
With a CAN 2.0 A frame, the arbitration 
field comprises the 11-bit identifier and  
a control bit, the RTR bit (Remote Trans-
mission Request).

With a CAN 2.0 B frame, the arbitration 

field comprises the 11-bit identifier, fol-
lowed by the SRR bit (Substitute Remote 
 Request) and the IDE (Identifier Extension 
Bit). Both bits are sent recessively and 
thereby ensure that a CAN 2.0 A frame 
 always takes priority over a CAN 2.0 B 
frame if it has the same 11-bit identifier. 
The second 18-bit identifier follows. The 
RTR bit completes the arbitration field.

The RTR bit indicates whether the trans-

mitted frame is a data or remote frame. 
The RTR bit is dominant in the data frame 
and recessive in the remote frame. If sta-
tion A, for example, happens to send a 
message by data frame and station B re-
quests this message by remote frame at  
the same time, the arbitration conflict can-
not be resolved in this situation by means 
of the message identifier: the RTR bit is the 
decisive factor for access authorization. 
First of all, station A wins arbitration  
with the sending of the dominant RTR bit 
and continues to transmit the message.  
Station B, which has requested precisely 
this message, prepares to receive and  
is able to read the other data sent by 
 station A.

Control field
In a CAN 2.0 A frame, the control field 
comprises the IDE bit (Identifier Extension 
Bit), which is always sent as dominant 
here, followed by a reserved bit for future 
extensions, which is sent recessively. The 
remaining four bits in this field define the 
number of data bytes in the next data field. 
This enables the receiver to determine 
whether all data has been received.

The structure of a CAN 2.0 B frame is 
practically identical. However, since the 
IDE bit already belongs to the arbitration 
field, a further reserved bit for future ex-
tensions takes its place and this reserved 
bit is sent recessively.

Data field
The data field contains the actual mes- 
sage information comprised of between  
0 and 8 bytes. A data field in which the 
length of the data is expressed in 0 results 
in the shortest possible data frame with  
a length of 44 or 64 bits. A frame like this 
can be used to synchronize distributed 
processes. A number of signals can be 
transmitted in a single message (e.g. en-
gine temperature and engine speed).

CRC field
The CRC field (Cyclic Redundancy Check-
sum) contains a 15-bit checksum (frame 
check word) across the preceding frame 
from the start bit to the final bit of the data 
field. The 16th bit (CRC delimiter) in this 
field is recessive and closes the checksum.  
The checksum is a means of detecting 
 possible transmission interference.

ACK field
Unlike all preceding fields, the ACK field 
(acknowledgment) is not set by the sender 
of the frame but by a different node that is 
able to acknowledge receipt of the frame 
directly after the data field. This field 
 comprises the ACK slot and the recessive  
ACK delimiter. The ACK slot is also trans-
mitted recessively by the sender and over-

78     Bus systems  |  CAN bus

written as dominant by a receiver upon the 
message being correctly received. Here, it 
is  irrelevant whether the message is of any 
significance for the particular receiver in 
the sense of an acceptance check (message 
filtering). Only correct receipt is con-
firmed. This signals to the sender that no 
malfunction occurred during data transfer.

End of frame
The end of frame marks the end of the 
message and comprises seven recessive 
bits. With seven bits of the same value in 
succession, the stuffing rule is deliberately 
broken (see Error detection). 

Interframe space
The interframe space comprises a succes-
sion of three recessive bits which serve to 
separate successive messages. After a total 
of 10 of these recessive bits, the stations 
are permitted to begin transmitting within 
the network again. Until then, the bus re-
mains in idle state.

Only data and remote frames need to 
 include the interframe space. Error and 
overload frames can be sent immediately 
after the last frame. This enables immedi-
ate signaling of errors and problems.

Transmitter initiative
The transmitter will usually initiate a data 
transmission by sending a data frame. It is 
also possible for a receiving station to call 
in data from a sending station by deposit-
ing a remote frame. The network node  
that is able to deliver the information re-
quested makes the information available  
in response to this query.

Error detection
The bus line may suffer interference, e.g. 
electromagnetic interference. To eliminate 
the risk of faulty behavior, the transmitted 
data must be checked for correctness.  
A number of control mechanisms for 
 detecting errors are integrated in the  
CAN protocol.

Cyclic redundancy check
For every transmitted message, the trans-
mitter calculates a check sequence from 
the start-of-frame, arbitration, control and 
data field. A 15-bit checksum is derived 
from the bit sequence by means of a gener-
ator polynomial. The checksum is then 
used to detect errors in the data transfer.
With CRC generation, a defined genera-

tor polynomial is used to carry out poly-
nomial division across a given frame 
range. The remainder forms the checksum.
Once the CRC field has been received, 
the receiver is able to check that the frame 
has been transferred correctly by carrying 
out its own polynomial division of the re-
ceived frame range using the generator 
polynomial and checking whether the re-
ceived checksum matches the calculated 
remainder.

Frame check
The frame check involves all bus subscrib-
ers, senders as well as receivers, checking 
the sent/received data frame for compli-
ance with the predefined frame structure. 
The CAN protocol contains a number of 
fixed-format fields (start and end-of-
frame, delimiter) which are checked  
by all stations.

ACK check
With the ACK check, a receiver acknow-
ledges that the frame has been received 
correctly by sending a dominant bit in the 
ACK slot. The sender of the frame can then 
verify whether a message was transferred 
correctly. An absence of this bit indicates 
that a transmission error has been de-
tected.

Monitoring
The sender of a frame continuously moni-
tors the bus level. It is able to detect a 
transmission error by comparing the  
sent bit and the sampled bit.

Bus systems  |  CAN bus     79

Fault confinement in the event of failures
Defective stations could weigh heavily on 
bus traffic if they were to frequently send 
erroneous messages or interrupt the trans-
mission of correct messages by repeatedly 
sending an error frame. The CAN protocol 
localizes station failures by means of 
statististical error analysis. A station rec-
ognizes the probability of its own malfunc-
tion by how often it aborts messages be-
fore other stations send an error frame. 
The protocol's first measure in this case  
is to prevent a station such as this from 
continuing to abort transmissions. In an 
emergency, the station shuts down auto-
matically.

Bit stuffing
Compliance with bit stuffing is checked by 
means of the code check. The stuffing con-
vention stipulates that in every data frame 
or remote frame a maximum of five suc-
cessive bits of equal state may be sent be-
tween the start of frame and the end of  
the CRC field. As soon as five identical bit 
states have been transmitted in succes-
sion, the sender includes a bit with the op-
posite state. The receiving station clears 
all of these inserted bits after the message 
has been received (destuffing). 

This measure permits detection of line 
faults, e.g. short-circuit or burst interfer-
ence. Rare signal changes would affect  
the possibility for synchronization in the 
nodes.

Error handling
If a CAN controller detects a fault or for-
mat error, it interrupts the current trans-
mission by sending an error frame com-
prising six successive dominant bits. This 
breaks the stuffing rule that prohibits this 
type of bit sequence. If the sender detects 
that its message has been interrupted by 
an error frame, it stops transmitting and 
makes another attempt at a later time.  
This effect prevents other stations from 
accepting the erroneous message and 
thereby ensures consistency of data  
across the entire system.

80     Bus systems  |  CAN bus

Hardware
CAN controller of a subscriber
The CAN controller of a subscriber gener-
ates a frame from the data to be sent con-
taining all the fields required for compli-
ance with the CAN protocol. It then con-
verts the frame into a bit stream.

CAN only specifies the physical, trans-
portation and object layers. The interfaces 
that are provided in the application layer 
can be arranged differently to suit the field 
of application. In order to provide proper 
CPU support (electronic control unit mi-
crocontroller for application software) for 
a wide range of different requirements, 
semiconductor manufacturers have 
brought onto the market products that 
provide a variety of capabilities. They dif-
fer neither in the frame format they pro-
duce, nor in their error-handling methods, 
but solely in the type of CPU support re-
quired for message administration.

If messages on the bus are managed in 
extended format (29-bit identifier), the 
CAN controllers must be compatible with 
the CAN 2.0 B specification. There are 
controllers that only support CAN 2.0 A 
and send and receive messages in the 
standard format, but that generate errors 
with messages in the extended format. 
Other controllers are able to tolerate the 
extended format without generating an 
 error. These modules can be used in a CAN 
together with controllers that administer 
the sending and receiving of messages in 
the extended format.

Basic CAN
In modules with basic-CAN implementa-
tion, only the basic function of the CAN 
protocol for the generation of the bit 
stream is implemented in the hardware. 
For the management of the messages to be 
sent and received, there is an intermediate

Modules without local computer
A further category of CAN module is one 
that is supplied without a local computer. 
These SLIOs (Serial Linked Input/Output) 
are able to input and output data via ports. 
They are therefore suitable for making 
sensors and actuators bus-compatible at 
low cost, but they do need a master that 
controls them.

Transceiver
The bit stream generated by the CAN con-
troller is made up of binary signals. They 
do not yet correspond to the required volt-
age levels of the CAN bus. The CAN-bus in-
terface module, or transceiver, generates 
the differential signals CAN_H and CAN_L 
and the reference voltage Uref from the 
 binary data stream.

Sleep mode
The CAN comfort bus must remain ready 
for operation even with the ignition 
switched off so that functions such as the 
radio, power windows or parking lamp 
may continue to operate. The bus sub-
scribers must therefore be supplied by 
 terminal 30 (permanent positive). After 
terminal 15 has been switched off (ignition 
off), a CAN node may enter sleep mode 
(standby) to relieve the vehicle electrical 
system of as much load as possible. The 
transmitter part of the transceiver module 
is switched off in this condition to mini-
mize the power consumption in this mode 
of operation. However, the receiver part 
remains active and checks whether mes-
sages are being sent on the bus. In this 
way, the CAN controller, which also enters 
standby mode, is able to react to a wake-up 
message and fully activate the CAN node.

buffer to which the local computer (appli-
cation software microcontroller) has ac-
cess (Fig. 10). Since the buffer capacity  
is limited, the computer must read the 
 received data before new messages are 
 received. Message filtering also takes 
place in this computer. A part of the 
 computer's capacity is therefore used for 
CAN management. Since the computers  
do not usually have sufficient processing 
capacity, modules with basic CAN are pri-
marily suitable for low bit rates, or for the 
transmission of fewer messages but at 
higher bit rates.

The advantage of these modules, in com-

parison to modules with full CAN, is the 
smaller chip surface and the lower manu-
facturing costs.

Full CAN
Full CAN implementation is the protocol of 
preference in cases where a station has to 
manage several messages at high bit rates 
and the local computer has no free capac-
ity for communication tasks. They contain 
several “communication objects”, each of 
which contains the identifier and the data 
of a particular message. During the initial-
ization of the CAN module by the local 
computer, it is decided which messages 
the CAN controller should send and which 
received messages it should process fur-
ther. Received messages are only accepted 
(message filtering) if the identifier matches 
one of the communication objects. 

CAN controllers with full-CAN imple-
mentation relieve the burden on the local 
computer by performing all of the commu-
nication including message filtering in the 
controller (Fig. 11). 

The CAN controller can be coupled to 
the microcontroller in the electronic con-
trol unit as a stand-alone module by the 
address/data bus. Powerful microcon-
trollers have the CAN controller integrated 
on-chip. This type of bus coupling is the 
more cost-effective and thus the more 
common solution.

82     Bus systems  |  CAN bus

Data transfer sequence
Using the transfer of engine speed as an 
example, it shall be demonstrated how 
data is transferred on a CAN with full-CAN 
module.

Transmission
The engine management's application soft-
ware calculates the engine speed from the 
signal from the engine-speed sensor. This 
value is calculated once for every combus-
tion cycle. The measured value enters both 
the receive buffer and the transmit buffer 
of the microcontroller (Fig. 12a).

The engine-management microcon-
troller is coupled to the CAN controller  
by a parallel interface. The contents of  
the transmit buffer are cyclically passed  
(e.g. every 10 ms) to the transmit buffer  
of the CAN controller. A flag notifies the 
CAN controller that a message is ready  
to be sent. With this transmit instruction, 
the engine management has completed its  
part of the task.

12 Data transfer sequence

Once the engine-speed information has 
been stored in the transmit buffer, the 
CAN controller begins to compile the CAN 
frame. Over the RxD line, the CAN con-
troller now monitors the bus. If the bus is 
free, it immediately starts to generate the 
bit stream and directs it to the transceiver 
on the TxD line; if the bus is occupied, it 
waits. From the bit stream, the transceiver 
creates a signal with the requisite voltage 
level.

Reception
The message originally sent by the engine 
management and forwarded on by the 
transceiver is received by all stations 
 connected to the bus (Fig. 12b). The mes-
sage reaches the CAN controller on the 
RxD lines in the form of a bit stream. 

At the first stage (monitoring layer),  
the CAN controller checks the incoming 
message for errors using the CRC check-
sum. If the message is free of errors, each

station responds with an acknowledge 
(ACK check).

At the second stage, or acceptance layer, 

the message undergoes message filtering. 
Each station checks whether the received 
identifier is addressed to the particular 
station and whether the message is re-
quired in the application software. If not, 
the message is rejected. Otherwise, it 
makes its way to the receive buffer. A flag 
notifies the application software that a 
new message is ready for processing. 

The instrument cluster, for example, 
calls up the available message, processes 
the engine-speed information and calcu-
lates triggering signals for the actuator of 
the rev counter.

Standardization
The International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO) and SAE (Society of Au-
tomotive Engineers) have issued CAN stan-
dards for data exchange in automotive ap-
plications:

  An ISO Standard for diagnosis via CAN 
has also been published as ISO 15 765

Standardization makes it possible for 
 components of different manufacturers  
to function together. No adaptations are 
required.

CAN is also widely used in industrial auto-
mation. These applications are supported 
by an alliance of companies in the “CAN in 
Automation” users group (CiA). 

Bosch has concluded contracts with its 
licensees that guarantee that any CAN im-
plementations will be able to communicate 
with each other. Users will be able to rely 
on the interaction of any CAN modules.

  Bus systems  |  LIN bus

LIN bus

Overview
The increasing use of mechatronic systems 
in the motor vehicle gave rise to the idea  
of designing a cost-effective bus system  
as an alternative to the low-speed CAN.  
In 1998, several automotive manufacturers 
founded a consortium with the aim of de-
veloping a specification for a serial bus for 
the networking of sensors and actuators in 
the body electronics area.

It was believed that a bus system with 
simple bus protocol and a simple sequence 
control would make it possible to use even 
low-capability microcontrollers without 
additional hardware for the communica-
tion interface.

The workgroup's resulting LIN bus spec-
ification was introduced into mass produc-
tion with the Mercedes-Benz SL as early as 
2001. 

The name, LIN (Local Interconnect 
 Network), is derived from the fact that  
all electronic control units are located 
within a demarcated installation space  
(e.g. in the door). The LIN, therefore, is  
a local subsystem for supporting the vehi-
cle network by means of superordinate 
CAN networks.

1 LIN bus with master and slave nodes

The LIN bus is suitable for low data rates 
of up to 20 kBit/s and is typically limited to 
a maximum of 16 bus subscribers.

The electrical interface can be created 
easily and cost-effectively in the network 
nodes. As far as the nodes are concerned, 
a distinction is made between the master, 
which is generally an electronic control 
unit connected to a superordinate bus sys-
tem, and the slaves. These are intelligent 
actuators, intelligent sensors or, quite sim-
ply, just switches with additional hardware 
for the LIN-bus interface.

The bus subscribers are usually ar-
ranged in a linear bus topology and con-
nected to each other by a single-wire line. 
This topology, however, is not explicitly 
specified.

Communication on the LIN bus takes 

place in a time-synchronous manner, 
whereby the master defines the time grid. 
Consequently, there arises a strictly deter-
ministic LIN bus response.

Figure 1 shows an example of a LIN net-
work as a subbus in the roof/wiper area of 
the motor vehicle. Here, the bus comprises 
a central electronic control unit, as the 
master, and the four slaves: mirror, garage-
door opener, rain/light sensor and wiper 
actuator. The master also functions as a 
gateway to the Chassis CAN, the Body CAN 
and the Diagnostics CAN.

Data transmission system
The LIN bus is designed as an unshielded 
single-wire line. The bus may adopt two 
logical states: 
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The dominant level corresponds to the 
electrical voltage of approx. 0 V and 
 represents logical 0

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The recessive level corresponds to 
 battery voltage UBat and represents  
the logical 1 state

The recessive level is characterized by a 
resistance to battery voltage of 1kV in the 
master and 30kV in the slaves.

Due to circuitry variations, there may be 

differences in the voltage levels. A stable 
data transfer is ensured by the defining of 
tolerances for sending and receiving in the 
areas of the recessive and dominant levels. 
The tolerance zones on the reception side 
are wider (Fig. 2) to make it possible for 
valid signals to be received despite inter-
ference radiation.

The data rate of the LIN bus is limited  
to a maximum of 20 kBit/s. This is the out-
come of a compromise between the de-
mand for high edge steepness for easy syn-
chronization of the slaves on the one hand, 
and the demand for lower edge steepness 
for improved EMC characteristics on the 
other. The standard bit rates of 2,400 Bit/s, 
9,600 Bit/s and 19,200 Bit/s are recom-
mended. The minimum permissible value 
for the bit rate is 1 kBit/s to prevent time-
out conflicts. The edge steepness itself  
is defined in the LIN specification as  
1 to 3 V/µs.

The maximum number of nodes is not 

specified in the LIN specification. It is 
 theoretically limited by the number of 
available identifiers. In practice, the num-
ber of subscribers is restricted to 16 due  
to the maximum permissible total capacity 
of the bus system.

Bus access
Access to the LIN bus is determined by the 
master-slave principle. Each message is 
initiated by the master. The slave has the 
possibility to respond. The messages are 
exchanged between the master and one, 
several or all of the slaves (point-to-point, 
multicast, broadcast).

The following relationships are possible 
in the communication between master and 
slave:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Message with slave response: the master 
sends a message to one or more slaves 
and asks for data (e.g. switch states or 
measured values)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Message with master instruction: the 

master gives a slave a control instruction 
(e.g. switch on a servomotor)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The master initiates communication 

 between two slaves

No arbitration or conflict management is 
required because, with the master-slave 
access control, the master alone controls 
access to the data line.

LIN protocol
Frame
The information transferred on the  
LIN bus is embedded in a defined frame 
(Fig. 3). A message initiated by the master 
always begins with a header. The response 
(message field) contains different informa-
tion depending on the type of message.  
If the master wishes to transmit control 
 instructions for a slave, it will populate the 
response with data to be used by the slave. 
If the master is transmitting a data request, 
the slave that it is addressing will populate 
the response with the data requested by 
the master.

Header
The head is composed of the following 
parts:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The synchronization break
  The synchronization field
  The identifier field

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

Synchronization
To guarantee consistent data transfer 
 between master and slaves, a synchroniza-
tion takes place at the beginning of each 
frame. First of all, the beginning of a  
frame is unambiguously marked by the 
synchronization break (SynchBreak).

The SynchBreak comprises at least 13 con-
secutive dominant levels and one recessive 
level.

At the end of the synchronization break, 
the master sends the synchronization field 
(SynchField) consisting of the bit sequence 
01010101. The slaves are then able to ad-
just themselves to the time basis of the 
master and thus synchronize.

The synchronization method described 
permits a loose specification of the timing 
of the bus subscribers. The clocking of  
the master should not deviate more than 
±0.5 % from the nominal value. The clock-
ing of the slaves is permitted to deviate by 
up to 15 % before synchronization as long 
as the synchronization reduces the devia-
tion to a maximum of 2 % before the end  
of the message.

In this way, the slaves can be built with-

out an expensive quartz oscillator, e.g. 
 using a simple RC circuit.

Identifier
The third byte in the header is used as the 
LIN identifier. As with the CAN bus, a con-
tent-based addressing method is used –  
the identifier therefore provides informa-
tion about the content of a message (e.g. 
engine speed). Based on this information, 
all nodes connected to the bus decide 
whether they would like to receive and 
process the message further or simply 
 ignore it. This process is known as accep-
tance filtering.

Six of the eight bits of the identifier field 

determine the identifier itself. Their per-
mutations give rise to a possible 64 differ-
ent identifiers (ID). They have the follow-
ing meanings:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  ID = 0 to 59: transmission of signals.
ID = 60: master request for the com-
mands and diagnosis

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  ID = 61: slave response to ID 60
  ID = 62: reserved for manufacturer-

 specific communication

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  ID = 63: reserved for future extensions 

to the protocol

Of the 64 possible messages, 32 may only 
contain two data bytes, 16 may only con-
tain four data bytes, and the remaining 16 
eight data bytes each.

The last bits in the identifier field con-

tain two checksums, which are used to 
check the identifier for transmission er-
rors and any resulting incorrect message 
assignments.

Data field
Once the header sent by the master node 
has been transmitted, it is time for the 
transfer of the actual data to begin. The 
slaves know from the transmitted identi-
fier whether or not they are being ad-
dressed and, if they are, they reply with 
their response in the data field.

Several signals can be packed into one 

frame. In this case, each signal has pre-
cisely one generator, i.e. it is always writ-
ten by the same node of the network. 

During the data transfer of the bytes,  
it is always the least significant bit (LSB) 
that is output first. Each byte (8 bits) is 
preceded by a start bit and followed by  
a stop bit, which means that each byte 
 involves the transmission of ten bits.  
The purpose of the start and stop bits is  
to resynchronize the nodes and thereby 
prevent transmission errors.

The data response of the slaves is veri-

fied by means of a checksum.

 

LIN description file 
The configuration of the LIN bus, in other 
words the specification of network sub-
scribers, signals and frames is managed  
in the LIN description file, or ldf. For this 
purpose, the LIN specification provides for 
an appropriate configuration language.

From the ldf, a set of C codes or header 
files is automatically generated using suit-
able tools. These are used as the basis for 
implementing the master and slave func-
tions in the electronic control units con-
nected to the bus.

88

  Bus systems  |  LIN bus

The ldf is therefore a means of configuring 
the entire LIN network. It represents a 
common interface between the vehicle 
manufacturer and the supplier of the 
 master or slave modules.

Message scheduling
The scheduling table in the ldf defines the 
sequence and time grid in which messages 
are sent. Frequently needed information is 
sent more often. Once the table has been 
worked through, the master begins with 
the first message again. The sequence in 
which the table is worked through may 
change depending on the operating status 
(e.g. diagnostics active/inactive, ignition 
on/off).

The transfer grid of each message is 
therefore known. This deterministic be-
havior is guaranteed by the fact that, with 
the master-slave access control principle, 
all messages are initiated by the master. 

Network management
The nodes of an LIN network can be forced 
into sleep mode to minimize the no-load 
current of the entire electronics and elec-
trical system in the vehicle. Sleep mode 
can be achieved in two ways:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The master sends the go-to-sleep com-
mand with the reserved identifier 60

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The slaves enter sleep mode of their own 

accord if no data transfer has taken 
place on the bus for a relatively long 
 period (4 seconds)

Both the master and the slaves are able to 
wake up the network. To do so, they must 
send the wake-up signal. This comprises 
data byte 128. After a break of 4 to 64 bit 
times (wake-up delimiter), all nodes must 
have been initialized and be ready to re-
spond to the master.

Example: air-conditioning control
The LIN bus is typically used in the control 
of the air-conditioning system. The operat-
ing and display unit functions as the bus 
master. This is where the software for the 
open and control algorithms are stored.

One of its tasks is to adjust the speed of 
the fresh-air blower. The controlled vari-
able for this is the actual temperature in 
the passenger cell and the desired temper-
ature set by the driver. The electronic con-
trol unit receives the interior temperature 
from a temperature sensor located in an 
appropriate place in the interior. The de-
sired temperature is set at the control unit, 
e.g. using a sensor ring.

From the input variables, the electronic 

control unit calculates that the blower 
speed needs to be increased to a value of 
200 rpm, for example. The electronic con-
trol unit transmits a message containing 
the master instruction to the LIN bus at a 
defined time interval. The identifier in this 
example would be “set the blower speed”. 
In this subbus, this instruction corre-
sponds to identifier 25, for example. 
 Following the header containing this iden-
tifier, the master transmits a numerical 
value in the data field that equates to the 
physical value of 200 rpm. Each slave pos-
sesses a list of identifiers that are relevant 
for this node. The fresh-air blower is the 
one and only slave that responds to the 
“set blower speed” identifier and executes 
the master's request.

At speeds below idle, the fresh-air 
blower must be switched off. At this low 
speed, the heavy load could cause the en-
gine to stall. The LIN bus is coupled to the 
CAN bus via the gateway and thus receives 
the current engine speed on a continuous 
basis. If the speed falls below the specified 
engine-speed threshold, the LIN master 
sends the message containing the “set 
blower speed” identifier where the data 
field contains the value 0. The fresh-air 
blower switches off in response.

Intelligent actuators can send up-to-date 
operating-status information to the actuat-
ing unit. The fresh-air blower records the 
speed by means of a sensor and sends it 
back on the LIN bus as a numerical value. 
Due to the master-slave access method,  
the value is only contained in a message 
with slave response initiated by the mas-
ter. The feedback signal with the current 
engine speed makes it possible to control, 
and therefore accurately maintain, the 
 desired value.

Bluetooth

Overview
Mobile communication is gaining ever 
more importance in all domains. For con-
venient communication between various 
devices, a wireless link is indispensable. 
Infrared connections, as often used in 
the past, tended to be manufacturer-
 specific, they required a direct line of 
sight and  imposed constraints on the 
area of movement. Only with a standard-
ized, wireless link could mobile devices 
of  different manufacturers communicate 
with each other without problems.

The development of the Bluetooth 
standard began in 1994 at the telecom-
munications company, Ericsson. As part 
of an initial study, Ericsson investigated 
the possibilities for completely replacing 
the cable connections between the cell 
phone and additional devices. In cooper-
ation with other industry partners, the 
Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) 
was formed in 1998 to create a uniform, 
internationally-accepted standard. The 
SIG set itself the aim of specifying a wire-
less technology with low manufacturing 
costs, low energy consumption and ro-
bust resistance to interference. The 
 wireless interface had to be suitable  

for transmitting data for multimedia 
 applications.

In the meantime, the Bluetooth SIG has 

expanded to involve around 2,000 com-
panies from the telecommunications, data 
processing and automotive engineering 
fields.

Applications
Bluetooth is an industry standard for  
the networking of mobile multimedia 
 devices, such as a car sound system, cell 
phone, headset, PDA (Personal Digital 
Assistant), PC and peripheral equipment 
(Fig. 1). Bluetooth stands for the simple 
exchange of data between portable ter-
minals and the wireless transmission of 
audio and video signals for entertain-
ment and information.

The short-range wireless connectivity 
of Bluetooth eliminates the need for con-
nection cables between the cell phone 
and the hands-free system: no more 
 tangling of cables when making a call.  
It is in this area that Bluetooth has been 
the most well received.

Meanwhile, a large number of con-
sumer electronics devices, be they cell 
phones, PDAs, notebooks or car phones, 
now offer an address book function.

With Bluetooth, it is possible to conve-
niently synchronize the entries stored  
in the various address books. The car 
driver is spared the laborious task of 
typing the phone number stored in the 
cell phone or PDA or inputting an ad-
dress into the navigation system. 

Bluetooth also makes it possible to 
 listen to the radio through a headset in 
the rear of the vehicle and to control  
the car sound system using a PDA.

Bluetooth is predominantly used for  
the transfer of data in the multimedia 
 domain. However, this technology can 
quite easily be used for diagnostic and 
service purposes. Workshops or break-
down services would be able to conve-
niently read vehicle information during 
fault diagnosis and record the condition 
of the vehicle.

Bluetooth versions
The first specification (Bluetooth 1.0) of 
the Bluetooth standard was adopted in 
July 1999. In December 1999 this specifi-
cation was replaced by Bluetooth 1.0b, 
which contained improvements and clar-
ifications for interoperability. February 
2001 saw the release of the Bluetooth 1.1 
specification, which fixed fundamental 
 interoperability problems between the 
first devices and chips and is used in 
most Bluetooth devices today. Three 
years later, in November 2003, version 
1.2 of the specification was published. 
This used the IEEE (Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers) language def-
inition for technical documentation and 
introduced adaptive frequency hopping 
(AFH) as a technical advancement that 
improves resistance to interference in 
the frequency band. The most significant 
modification was introduced with ver-
sion 2.0 of the specification in November 
2004. With the enhanced data rate (EDR), 
it was possible to triple the bit rate from 
1 MBit/s to 3 MBit/s and reduce power 
consumption. With each new version of 

the specification, great emphasis was 
placed on backward compatibility with 
the previous  versions.

Transmission technology
Frequency band
Bluetooth operates in the worldwide-
 license-free 2.4 GHz ISM band (Industrial 
Scientific Medicine). This is available 
 practically worldwide without approval  
– apart from certain national limitations – 
and is reserved for applications in indus-
try, science and medicine. For this rea-
son, the possibility of interference from 
garage-door openers, microwave ovens 
or other appliances which operate using 
the same frequency band has to be ac-
cepted. To minimize interference, the 
best possible use should be made of the 
frequency spectrum. Devices that use  
the ISM band therefore implement 
spread-spectrum techniques.

Frequency-hopping method
Bluetooth divides the 2.4 GHz band  
into 79 channels at intervals of 1 MHz 
(f = 2,402 + k, k = 0…78). The band is 
 terminated at both the upper and lower 
end by two guard bands with a width of 
3.5 MHz (upper guard band) and 2 MHz 
(lower guard band). The transmission

8 differential phase-shift keying (8DPSK), 
which modulate the phase of the carrier. 
p/4DQPSK represents one of four com-
binations of a bit pair (00, 01, 10 and 11) 
and so transfers a maximum of two bits; 
8DPSK can represent any combination  
of three bits. This is used to increase the 
bit rate from 1 MBit/s (net 727 kBit/s) to 
2 MBit/s (net 1,446 kBit/s) with GFSK,  
or 3 MBit/s (net 2,169 kBit/s) with EDR.

Power classes
Bluetooth devices are categorized into 
different power classes. Manufacturers 
are free to decide which power class they 
implement. The present specifications 
 define three power classes:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Class 1 with 100 mW (20 dBm) trans-
mission output for a range of 100 to 
150 m
  Class 2 with 2.5 mW (4 dBm) transmis-
sion output for a range of 10 to 25 m
  Class 3 with 1 mW (0 dBm) transmis-
sion output for a range of 10 m

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

Topology
Bluetooth supports the automatic config-
uration of ad-hoc networks. This means 
that two or more devices are able to 
spontaneously form a network with no 
prior knowledge of each other. Bluetooth 
is based on the master-slave principle.  
In principle, any Bluetooth device may  
be a master or a slave. The master is a 
special device that coordinates commu-
nication between the devices.

uses a combined frequency-hopping/ 
time division duplex (FH/TDD) method: 
the frequency-hopping spread spectrum 
(FHSS, Fig. 2). The channels are switched 
1,600 times per second (i.e. in 625 µs 
slots). The slots are assigned in accor-
dance with the TDD method, i.e. the 
transmitter and receiver are authorized 
to send alternately. The frequency-hop-
ping method guarantees optimal and 
 uniform use of the ISM band and makes 
Bluetooth resistant to interference from 
other transmitters in the same frequency 
band (e.g. WLAN). In addition, it also 
 offers some security because a hacker 
would not know the destination of a fre-
quency switch or indeed the time frame 
for which a particular frequency would 
be valid. This makes interception of a 
connection much more difficult. 

The introduction of adaptive fre-

quency hopping (AFH) in the Bluetooth 
1.2 specification further increased 
 Bluetooth's resistance to interference 
and reduced the effect of Bluetooth itself 
as a source of interference on other de-
vices in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The num-
ber of effective channels is dynamically 
adaptable to the conditions in the fre-
quency band. Frequencies used by other 
transmitters are then removed from the 
list of 79 possible  channels.

Modulation method
Bluetooth uses the Gaussian frequency-
shift keying (GFSK) method of modula-
tion. This is a special variant of fre-
quency-shift keying (FSK) supplemented 
with a Gaussian low-pass filter. GFSK 
 varies the frequency and delivers 1 bit 
per keying interval. Bluetooth has a sym-
bol rate of 1 MBit/s. With the enhanced 
data rate (EDR) introduced with the 
 Bluetooth 2.0 specification, it has been 
possible to increase this data rate to 
3 MBit/s. This is made possible by the  
use of two variants of phase-shift keying 
(PSK): the p/4 differential quaternary 
phase-shift keying (p/4DQPSK) and the  

Bus systems  |  Bluetooth     93

Piconet
A network of Bluetooth devices is known 
as a piconet (Fig. 3). For the devices 
within a piconet, there are two roles: 
 master or slave. Which device assumes 
which role is not decided until communi-
cation is established. A device sets up a 
piconet and transmits its device ID and 
the value of its internal clock. This de-
vice becomes the master.

Any device that is not participating in  
a piconet but is not switched off remains 
in standby, which is marked by a small 
current draw.

The first stage in the creation of a 
piconet involves the potential master 
searching for other devices in its range 
(inquiry scan). Special frequency-hop-
ping sequences  (inquiry sequences) are 
available for this purpose. Devices that 
wish to enter into communication with 
other devices respond with an inquiry 
response message. By the end of the in-
quiry sequence, the information about all 
devices willing to communicate is avail-
able. The potential master is now able to 
address a specific device by means of a 
special paging sequence. Paging is a pro-
cess whereby a fixed connection is es-
tablished between a master and a slave. 
The slave contains all the information it 
needs to synchronize with the master.

The piconet is defined by the frequency-
hopping sequence, i.e. the sequence of 
switching between the 79 possible chan-
nels. The hopping sequence is specified  
by the master and is calculated from the 
master's device ID (a worldwide unique 
48-bit identifier) and its internal clock. 
The slaves synchronize with the master's 
clock and its hopping sequence. 

A master is able to manage up to seven 
active slaves. Each active slave receives  
a 3-bit active member address (AMA). 
Active devices can send data or even 
simply remain connected. By deregister-
ing, a device can switch back to standby.  
A Bluetooth device may also switch to 
any of three energy saving modes: hold 
mode, sniff mode and park mode. The 
devices continue to be synchronized with 
the hopping sequence of the piconet. The 
lowest energy saving mode is the park 
mode, where the device relinquishes its 
AMA and receives in its place an 8-bit 
parked member address (PMA). With the 
PMA, the device is still a subscriber in  
the piconet but makes way for another, 
active device. Parked devices remain 
synchronized with the hopping sequence 
of the  piconet and can be addressed and 
reactivated by the master using the PMA.

Scatternet
In a piconet, only one slave is ever able  
to communicate with the master simulta-
neously. When more slaves enter the net-
work, the data rate per device falls very 
quickly. This is where scatternets pro-
vide a solution. A scatternet consists of 
up to ten piconets in which the individ-
ual piconets partly overlap. In this way, it 
is possible to set up even larger networks  
in which all network subscribers may 
connect to one another. The scatternet  
in Figure 4 comprises two piconets. One 
of the Bluetooth devices is a member of 
both piconets. Through this device, the 
two networks are able to exchange data. 
However, this device, which is assigned

to more than one piconet, can only func-
tion as master in one of these networks.
A device that is assigned to two picon-
ets in a scatternet must synchronize with 
the network with which it wishes to com-
municate. It cannot remain connected to 
both networks at the same time. Before 
the device leaves the old piconet, it must 
inform its master that it will be unavail-
able for a certain period of time. The 
 remaining network subscribers can 
 continue to communicate.

A master, too, may leave its own 

 piconet and become a slave in another.  
All communication in its old network, 
however, is broken until it returns and 
assumes its master function again. 

A master cannot become master of a 
second piconet. If this were to happen, 
both piconets would behave in an identi-
cal manner and form a single network.

Physical data channel
A data channel is represented by a hop-
ping sequence between the 79 possible 
frequencies in the ISM band. Any device 
that is actively participating in a piconet 
must also hop at the same carrier fre-
quency (frequency fi). As soon as a mas-
ter has sent data at frequency fk, a slave 
can respond at frequency fk+1. This pro-
cedure is illustrated in Figure 5. 

It is conventional for the transmissions 
of the master to begin in the even time 
slots and those of the slaves to begin 
in the odd time slots. This characteris-
tic  conforms to the regular time-divi-
sion multiplexing method (TDD here) 
whereby the master uses one half of the 
time slots and the slaves the other half. 

In addition to packets that may occupy 

one time slot, Bluetooth provides for 
packets that may occupy three or five  
time slots (multi-slot packets). As soon  
as a master or slave sends a packet three 
or five time slots long, this transmitter 
will remain on the same frequency.  
There is no frequency change within  
a packet (Fig. 6).

Once the packet has been transferred, 
the frequency hops as determined by the 
hopping sequence (independently of the 
transmission process). In the illustration, 
for example, the frequency hops from  
fk  to fk+3 after the transmission of a 3-slot 
packet). The reason for this behavior is 
that not every station may have received 
the transmission and cannot therefore 
respond specifically to the transfer of 
data in several time slots. For this rea-
son, all stations that are not involved in 
the transmission always continue to hop 
in the sequence specified by the master.

Physical connections
Bluetooth supports both circuit-switched 
and packet-switched data channels. For 
circuit-switched, synchronous communi-
cation, Bluetooth offers a synchronous 
connection-oriented link (SCO), and an 
ACL (Asynchronous Connectionless Link) 
for packet-switched, asynchronous 
 communication. Between two Bluetooth 
devices, there may only ever be one  
ACL link but there can be up to three  
SCO links. The ACL links are the founda-
tion for the data transfer. The SCO links 
are purely voice channels with a data 
rate of 64 kBit/s. The voice is transmitted 
by continuously variable slope delta 
modulation (CVSD) or pulse-code modu-
lation (PCM). A Bluetooth master can 
maintain several different data channels 
between its slaves even at the same time.

Logical data channels
Logical channels refer to different types 
of channels streamed over a physical 
 connection. The data transmitted over  
a physical channel has different logical 
meanings. Bluetooth distinguishes be-
tween two categories of channel: link 
channels, which are used for the ex-
change of control information between 
master and slave; and user channels, 

which transfer data from the user level – 
the applications.

Data packets
A Bluetooth data packet generally 
 comprises three fields: 
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Access code 
  Header and 
  Payload 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

A packet may simply comprise the access 
code, or the access code and a header,  
or the access code, header and payload 
(Fig. 7). 

A packet begins with an access code.  
If a header follows, the access code has  
a length of 72 bits, otherwise it is 68 bits 
long. The access code is used for the 
 synchronization and identification of a 
piconet, for device polling and for device 
calls. There are three different types of 
 access code:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Channel access code (CAC), the purpose 
of which is to synchronize and identify 
a piconet. The CAC is sent with each 
packet transmitted over the piconet.
  Device access code (DAC), which is used 
to transfer specific identifiers during 
the device call (e.g. when paging).
  Inquiry access code (IAC), which is 
used for device polling.

The header of a Bluetooth packet is  
54 bits long and contains information 
about the link (link control information).  
It is made up of the address, packet type, 
flow control, error monitoring and 
checksum fields. The actual length of  
the header (i.e. the sum of the bits in  
the header) is 18 bits. The header is pro-
tected by forward error correction (FEC). 
The bits of the header are sent three 
times (1/3 FEC),  giving a header length of  
54 bits. A receiver can then simply take 
the majority decision; each bit triplet is 
resolved to the value with majority in  
the triplet.

The payload of a Bluetooth packet can 

be up to 341 bytes in size (1,023 bytes 
with EDR). The data field of the payload 
consists of up to three segments: the  
payload header, the payload itself and,  
in certain circumstances, a checksum.
Bluetooth uses 16 different packet 
types, the common feature of all being 
the access code and the header. The 
structure of the payload depends on the 
packet type concerned. Along with pack-
ets for ACL and SCO links, there are also 
packet types for polling the slaves, syn-
chronizing the hopping sequence and 
 acknowledging data transfers.

Bluetooth device addresses
A Bluetooth device is assigned a world-
wide unique Bluetooth device address. 
The address is derived from the IEEE-
802 standard and implemented in the de-
vice by the manufacturer. The 48-bit ad-
dresses are subdivided into three parts
  LAP (Lower Address Part, containing  
(cid:129)(cid:129)
24 bits)
  UAP (Upper Address Part, containing  
8 bits)
  NAP (Non-significant Address Part, 
containing 16 bits)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

The LAP and UAP fields form the signifi-
cant part of a Bluetooth device address. 

Bluetooth architecture
The Bluetooth architecture is complex. 
This is inherently associated with the 
idea behind general cable emulation.  
The architecture is designed to enable 
new protocols and applications to be 
adapted for the use of Bluetooth. Accord-
ingly, the Bluetooth protocol stack is 
very extensive (Fig. 8 shows a simplified 
version of the protocol stack).

The Bluetooth technology can be sub-

divided into three logical sections:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Hardware
  Host stack
  Applications

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

The hardware layer and the host stack  
are defined in the Bluetooth Core Specifi-
cation; the applications are part of the 
Bluetooth Profile Specification.

Hardware-side protocols
The hardware is represented by the 
 Bluetooth chip. This is where the radio 
layer, baseband and link management  
are contained. The radio layer deals with 
the radio transmission, used frequencies, 
modulations and transmission output. 
The baseband represents the link-estab-
lishment mechanisms, the packet struc-
ture and the timing. The link management 
establishes and manages the link between

two devices and also implements security 
and authentication functions. 

The host controller interface (HCI) is 
the interface between the hardware of a 
Bluetooth module and the host-side pro-
tocols. The HCI is a hardware abstraction 
and realizes various interfaces for con-
trolling the Bluetooth hardware and 
transferring data (e.g. via USB or UART).

Host stack
The host stack uses the HCI to control 
the Bluetooth hardware and transfer 
data. The format of this data is deter-
mined by the upper protocol layers. The 
logical link control and adaptation proto-
col (L2CAP) implements the abstraction 
of the hardware's properties, adapts the 
upper layers of the protocol stack to the 
capabilities of the baseband and hides 
transmission details such as the connec-
tionless or  connection-oriented trans-
mission type. The L2CAP layer essen-
tially has three main functions: 
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  It can receive packets with a length of 
up to 64 kB from the upper layers and 
decomposes them into smaller data 
packets (segments) for processing in 
the lower layers if necessary. At the 
other end, the segments are recom-
posed back into packets.
  It manages the multiplexing and de-
multiplexing of several packet sources.  
If a packet is being recomposed, the 
L2CAP layer determines to which pro-
tocol of the upper layers the packet is 
forwarded.
  L2CAP offers functions for negotiating 
quality of service and configuration pa-
rameters. This means, for example, that 
the maximum size of the payload can be 
negotiated so that a device with limited 
resources would not be overwhelmed 
by overly large packets. Using the con-
figuration parameter for the quality of 
service, it is possible to define the 
properties of the data transfer: best ef-
fort (best attempt but with no guarantee 
of data transfer) or guaranteed.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

In addition to L2CAP, there are also au-
dio and control protocols that govern the 
handling of audio data and control data. 
Audio applications, for example, can 
make direct use of the baseband layer 
once the audio signals have been coded 
accordingly.

The service discovery protocol (SDP) is 
another important host-side protocol.  
It serves to identify and scan for services 
with specific properties and to describe 
services within range of a Bluetooth de-
vice. Bluetooth devices are meant to be 
able to interact on an ad hoc basis with 
other devices in different environments.  
It is therefore necessary to know which 
services are made available by which de-
vices within range. All devices wishing to 
provide services must use an SDP server; 
for all other devices, an SDP client is suf-
ficient. The SDP prepares the services 
available on a device in a service data-
base. The service information in the pos-
session of the SDP server is stored in a 
service record. The service record con-
sists of a list with service attributes that 
describe the properties of the service 
more precisely and is identified by a  
32-bit service record handle.

Two further protocols in the protocol 
stack form the fundamental basis for the 
interoperability of Bluetooth devices.

The RFCOMM (Radio Frequency Com-

munication) cable emulation protocol 
above the L2CAP layer simulates up to  
60 virtual serial interfaces derived in ac-
cordance with the ETSI 07.10 standard.  
As a result, almost any software that pre-
viously expected a serial interface can 
work with Bluetooth.

TCS BIN (Telephony Control Protocol 

Specification – Binary) is employed as  
the means of controlling telephone and 
telephony functions. This is a bit-ori-
ented protocol for establishing voice 
and data connections between Bluetooth 
devices. The use of appropriate, indus-

98     Bus systems  |  Bluetooth

try-wide standards has made it possible, 
here too, to ensure wide-ranging com-
patibility with legacy applications.

Applications
Many more protocols have been adapted 
for the Bluetooth standard (adapted pro-
tocols) and can be found in the protocol 
stack. Internet applications can, for ex-
ample, continue to use TCP/IP through 
the point-to-point protocol (PPP) or the 
Bluetooth network encapsulation proto-
col (BNEP). For the exchange of vCalen-
dars and vCards, it is possible to use the 
object exchange protocol (OBEX) cov-
ered by the IrDA standard.

Profiles
The uppermost layer contains the appli-
cations and profiles. Profiles represent 
“standard solutions” for a particular us-
age scenario. The Bluetooth specification 
currently brings together 13 different 
applications described as profiles. Each 
profile uses a certain choice of protocol; 
in principle, application profiles make  
a  different protocol stack available for 
each application. Profiles describe the 
vertical slice through the Bluetooth pro-
tocol stack; the protocols represent the 
horizontal layers (Fig. 9). Within the pro-
files, the required and optional functions 
of the layers are defined. These stan-
dardized profiles make it possible to en-
sure interoperability between different 
devices.

The four fundamental profiles of the 

Bluetooth specification are:

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Generic access profile (GAP)
  Service discovery application profile 
(SDAP)
  Serial port profile (SPP) and
  Generic object exchange profile 
(GOEP)

The Bluetooth profiles form the hierar-
chy (Fig. 10). The GAP forms the basis 
and describes all the essential functions 
that a Bluetooth device must fulfill at the 
lowermost level. These include, for ex-
ample, the functions for establishing and 
managing the link, the supported operat-
ing modes and the security of a link.

The SDAP defines the access interface 
for the service discovery protocol (SDP) 
with which devices can discover or poll  
the services offered by other devices.  
SDP builds on the GAP. All Bluetooth de-
vices must implement these two profiles.

The SPP is used by most other 

 Bluetooth profiles. One exception to  
this is the telephony control profile.  
This is always used when Bluetooth is 
 being used for cable emulation or if a 
 serial data connection is to be used.  
The SPP builds on the GAP and uses  
the RFCOMM protocol.

The GOEP defines the fundamental 
functions necessary for the exchange  
of complex objects. It defines a client-
server relationship for the exchange of 
data. Like the SPP, the GOEP provides  
the  foundation for further profiles.

▶ Origin of the name, Bluetooth

The name, Bluetooth, originates from 
King Harald Gormsen, a Danish Viking. 
Harald had the nickname, Blatand.   
In the Middle Ages, Bla actually meant 
dark, while Blatand made reference 
to the dark figure of Harald Gormsen. 
Bluetooth, therefore, is not a direct 
translation of Blatand. 

In the 10th Century, Harald Gorm-
sen united large parts of Denmark 
and Norway. The Bluetooth wireless 
system developed 1,000 years later 
unified a wide range of different infor-
mation, data processing and wireless 
mobile devices. This is why it was 
named after King Harald.

100     Bus systems  |  MOST bus

MOST bus

Introduction
The MOST bus (Media Oriented Systems 
Transport) was specifically developed for 
the networking of infotainment systems in 
motor vehicles. In addition to traditional 
entertainment functions, such as radio 
tuners or CD players, these infotainment 
systems (which are becoming an increas-
ingly common feature of modern vehicles, 
and premium class vehicles in particular) 
also offer video functions (DVD and TV), 
route guidance capabilities and access to 
mobile communications and information. 

Requirements
The functions of an infotainment system 
place high demands on a bus system.  
The transmission of multimedia data,  
both audio and video, requires a high  
data rate and a synchronization of the  
data transfer between source and sink  
as well as between sinks themselves. 

For the transmission of informational 
data, e.g. detailed information about the 
music tracks on an mp3 player, and the 
sending of software updates, it is neces-
sary for the data transfer to be flexible 
with varying and, at certain times,  
equally very fast data rates. 

Likewise, the requirements for use in a 
motor vehicle, and the associated require-
ments of electromagnetic compatibility 
(EMC), must also be fulfilled.

MOST Cooperation
It was with these requirements in mind 
that the MOST bus was developed by the 
MOST Cooperation. This was founded in 
1998 by BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Harman/
Becker and Oasis SiliconSystems (now part 
of SMSC). By 2006, the MOST Cooperation 
had 16 automotive manufacturers and 
67 suppliers and tool makers among its 
membership. 

The MOST Cooperation creates and ad-
ministers the specifications on which the 
MOST bus is based. Furthermore, it de-
fines the requirements for implementation 
of MOST devices and provides appropriate 
compliance tests through accredited test 
houses.

Type of use
At present, the MOST bus is almost exclu-
sively used for the networking of infotain-
ment systems in motor vehicles. It can cur-
rently be found in over 35 vehicle models 
of various manufacturers, especially in  
the premium and mid-range classes (as at 
2006).

Features of the MOST bus
The MOST bus supports the logical net-
working of up to 64 devices, at which point 
constraints associated with the chipsets 
may be encountered. 

In its current version, the MOST bus 
 offers a data rate of 24.8 MBit/s (MOST 25). 
Versions with higher data rates of 50 MBit/s 
(MOST 50) and 150 MBit/s (MOST 150) are 
already available as a development model.

Data transmission channels
For the transmission of data, the MOST bus 
supports the following channels and their 
different attributes:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The control channel is used for the sim-
ple transmission of control commands, 
for the signaling of device statuses and 
for the sending of messages necessary  
to system management. With MOST 25, 
the control channel has a gross band-
width of 705.6 kBit/s.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  For the transmission of multimedia data, 

the MOST bus has a flexible number  
of synchronous channels that are able  
to carry both audio and video data.  
In MOST 25, there are a maximum of  
15 audio channels available in stereo 
quality.

Bus systems  |  MOST bus     101

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  On the asynchronous channel, data is 
sent in packets. It is therefore suitable 
for transferring information that does 
not require a fixed data rate but does 
need a high data rate at certain times. 
Examples could be the transfer of track 
information of an mp3 player or a soft-
ware update. With MOST 25, the asyn-
chronous channel has a gross bandwidth 
of up to 12.7 MBit/s.

The available bandwidth can be flexibly 
distributed between the asynchronous 
channel and the synchronous channels  
by means of the “boundary descriptor”, 
which can also be shifted to the transit 
 period if relevant preconditions are met. 

Topology
A MOST system is arranged in a ring struc-
ture whereby a device is connected to its 
predecessor or successor in the ring by  
an input or output respectively (Fig. 1). 
One of the devices acts as the “timing 
 master” and generates the data frames  
for data transfer with which the other 
 devices synchronize.

Each device has a bypass. When this is 
closed, the device forwards the signal 
 directly and is therefore invisible to the 
MOST system. This service is useful,  
for example, when the system is starting 
and a device requires more time for initial-
ization, or in the event of a temperature-
 dependent shutoff.

There are also other possible structures 

for a MOST system, e.g. a star topology. 
 Internally, however, these must always  
be arranged to form a (logical) ring.  
With a star structure, this can be achieved 
through use of a central hub, for example.

Device model
The MOST standard defines the model 
shown in Figure 2 for a MOST device for 
which the following elements are required: 

At the lowermost level, the physical 
layer provides access to the transmission 
agent. Departing from the original defini-
tion that provided for optical transmission 
by POF cable (Plastic Optical Fiber), there 
are today various physical layers available 
with optical and electrical transmission as 
well as various speeds of transfer.

The MOST network interface controller 
(NIC) is a hardware controller that is re-
sponsible for controlling the physical layer 
and implements the basic transfer ser-
vices. While in the original version of the 
NIC many control tasks had to be carried 
out by the main processor of the device, 
the current version (Intelligent Network 
Interface Controller, INIC) is, for the most 
part, able to handle tasks autonomously 
and already implements substantial parts 
of the network service. Typical controllers 
for the MOST are the OS8104 (NIC) and the 
OS81050 (INIC), manufactured by SMSC.

The MOST network service is the driver 

layer through which applications and 
 system services have access to the NIC. 
The lower layer of the network service 
(layer 1) offers basic communication and 
management functions, while the layer 
above (layer 2) offers functions for sup-
porting the development of applications, 
such as a translator for the application 
protocol or support for the notification 
service.

The applications of the device are imple-

mented on top of the network service.  
In a MOST system, the interface of an ap-
plication is realized as a function block 
(FBlock). Each device must at least imple-
ment a special FBlock, the NetBlock,  
which is required for management func-
tions within the MOST system. In addition, 
a device will usually implement one or 
more applications that can be used as 
FBlocks of applications on other devices.  
A device of a vehicle infotainment system 
is often integrated with several functions, 
e.g. those of a radio tuner and those of an 
amplifier, which can be represented in the 
MOST system as independent FBlocks.

Transmission agent
The MOST bus was originally defined as  
an optical transmission agent that used a 
plastic optical fiber (POF). The optical sig-
nal used here with a wavelength of 650 nm 
(in the red wavelength range) is generated 
by an LED on the transmit side, which is 
designated Tx-FOT (FOT = Fiber Optic 
Transceiver). On the receive side, Rx-FOT, 
the optical signal is converted back into an 
electrical signal by a PIN photodiode.

The POF cables used for automotive 
 applications (Fig. 3) consist of a 980 μm 
thick optical core insulated by 20 μm thick 
optical cladding with a low refractive in-
dex. In total, the optical conductor there-
fore has a diameter of 1 mm. The optical 
 fiber is insulated with a black buffer, which 
is in turn surrounded by a protective cable 
sheathing. This gives the cable a total dia-
meter of 2.3 mm.

POF lines offer the following benefits 

when used in the motor vehicle:

tion

To date, modern vehicles are equipped 
 exclusively with MOST 25, with POF data 
transmission via POF connections. In addi-
tion to this, however, further transmission 
techniques have been defined for the 
MOST:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The optical transmission by glass fiber 
cable (PCS) with laser diodes (VCSEL), 
which offers a greater damping reserve, 
supports higher speeds and is less sensi-
tive to high temperatures. 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  An electrical transmission by copper 
 cable, which is also less sensitive to 
 temperature and is more economical by 
comparison, requires additional shield-
ing measures at higher bandwidths.  
This has consequences for costs and 
 cabling.

Data transfer
Data transfer on the MOST bus is orga-
nized into data frames, which are gener-
ated by the timing master with a fixed data 
rate and passed on by subsequent devices 
in the ring.

Data frames
The timing master normally generates  
data frames with a cycle of 44.1 kHz,  
and in rarer cases 48 kHz. The cycle is 
 defined by the system manufacturer  
(i.e. the vehicle manufacturer in conjunc-
tion with its device suppliers) to suit the 
predominant media formats in the system. 
The size of the data frames, by extension, 
determines the bus speed of a MOST sys-
tem. With MOST 25, the size of a data 
frame is 512 bits. 

A data frame is made up of the following 

ranges (Fig. 4):
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Areas for administrative information  
at the start and end of the data frame, 
the tasks of which include the synchro-
nization of the data transfer, determina-
tion of the devices' ring positions and 
the transmission of the boundary 
 descriptor

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  An area for the control channel (with 
MOST 25, two bytes per data frame)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  An area for the synchronous channels, 
whereby one or more bytes are always 
assigned to a specific synchronous 
 channel

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  An area for the asynchronous channel 

In the case of MOST 25, the synchronous 
and asynchronous area demand a 60-byte 
share of the data frame. The distribution 
between the synchronous channels and 
the asynchronous channel is determined 
by the value of the boundary descriptor 
with a resolution of 4 bytes. The synchro-
nous area must have at least 24 bytes  
(6 stereo channels). This means that  
24 to 60 bytes are permitted for the 
 synchronous area and 0 to 36 bytes are 
permitted for the asynchronous area.

System events
The fundamental system events described 
below indicate the current status of the 
data transfer in the MOST system. These 
are monitored by the NIC and forwarded 
by the network service to the applications, 
which must then respond accordingly.
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Lock, stable lock: a lock occurs as soon 
as communication is established in the 
ring, i.e. the correct device receives the 
correct data frames. A stable lock is set 
when the system has been in lock status 
for a specific period.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Unlock, critical unlock: an unlock de-
notes the loss of the lock, i.e. that no 
 correct data frames are being received. 
If the system is in the unlock state for  
a certain period, the status switches to 
critical unlock.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Network change event: if the number of 
devices in a MOST system changes be-
cause one device has opened or closed 
its bypass, this is signaled by a network 
change event. 

Addressing
Devices on the MOST bus are addressed by 
means of a 16-bit address. The following 
different addressing types are supported:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Logical addresses: each device has a log-
ical address that is unique in the system 
and is set and distributed when the sys-
tem starts. The logical addresses can  
be set dynamically based on the ring 
 position, for which, beginning with the 
timing master, the hexadecimal range 
0x100 to 0x13F is reserved. Or they  
can be defined statically by the system 
manufacturer in a range reserved spe-
cifically for this purpose.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Physical addresses: for system adminis-
tration services, e.g. determination of 
logical addresses, each device also has a 
physical address that is derived from its 
current ring position. The physical ad-
dresses are assigned the range 0x400 to 
0x43F. 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Group addresses: each device may also 

be assigned a group address in the 
0x300 to 0x3FF range, making it possi-
ble to address all devices in a given 
group at the same time.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Broadcast address: the MOST addition-
ally supports a special broadcast ad-
dress, hexadecimal 0x3C8, which makes 
it possible to address all devices in the 
MOST system.

Transmission of control commands
The control channel permits the transmis-
sion of control messages with a maximum 
length of 32 bytes. These have to be shared 
among consecutive data frames. With 
MOST 25, the 16 data frames required  
here are also known as a block. The format 
of the control messages is defined by the 
protocol described in the next section.

The sending of messages on the control 

channel is supported by the NIC. It pro-
vides the necessary services for data pro-
tection and channel arbitration, i.e. for de-
termining the next opportunity for a mes-
sage to be sent. The reliable transmission 
of control messages is safeguarded by the 
use of a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) and 
an automatic repeat request.

The control channel's gross bandwidth 
of 705.6 kBit/s is reduced to a net data rate 
of 406 kBit/s following the deduction of ap-
proximately 3 % for system administration 
overheads (two of 64 control messages) 
and less the extra overhead to account  
for arbitration and data protection. Since 
arbitration only allows a particular device 
to populate every third available control 
message, an individual device has a maxi-
mum data rate of 135 kBit/s at its disposal 
for sending.

To enable the sending of messages of 
more than 32 bytes, the network service 
supports the segmentation and deseg-
mentation of application messages up to 
65,556 bytes in size on the control chan-
nel. This service, also known as the appli-

Bus systems  |  MOST bus     105

cation message service (AMS), differs from 
the control message service (CMS), which 
only allows 32-byte control messages to  
be sent.

Transmission of multimedia data
In the MOST system, the transmission of 
multimedia data takes place on the syn-
chronous channels. The data transfer is 
controlled by relevant control commands 
on the control channel. A synchronous 
channel can be assigned a specific band-
width, which is achieved with a resolution 
of one byte of a data frame. A stereo audio 
channel with a resolution of 16 bits re-
quires four bytes, for example. In the  
case of MOST 25, a maximum of 60 bytes 
(depending on the value of the boundary 
descriptor) are available for the synchro-
nous channels, which equates to 15 stereo 
audio channels.

The sinks and sources for multimedia 
data are each assigned to an FBlock, which 
provides the necessary functions for their 
management. An FBlock may therefore 
contain several sources and sinks, which 
are numbered consecutively with a source 
and sink number respectively. 

An FBlock has functions that supply in-
formation about the quantity and type of 
sources and sinks that it makes available 
(SyncDataInfo, SourceInfo and SinkInfo). 
Furthermore, each FBlock with a source 
has an “Allocate” function with which it 
 requests a synchronous channel and asso-
ciates its source to it. Its “Deallocate” 
 function, on the other hand, is used to  
free up the channel again. 

Similarly, an FBlock with a sink has a 
 “Connect” function for connecting the sink 
to a particular synchronous channel, and 
a “DisConnect” function for its disconnec-
tion. Several sinks may also be connected 
to a particular channel at the same time. 

With MOST 25, the channel assignment 

for synchronous channels is managed  
by the timing master. A source wishing  

to  occupy a synchronous channel  
sends an appropriate system message 
 request (ResourceAllocate) to the tim- 
ing master. A corresponding message 
 (ResourceDeallocate) is used to free the 
channel.

Transmission of packet data
On the asynchronous channel, data is sent 
in the form of packets. The asynchronous 
channel currently supports two modes:  
a slower 48-byte mode, where 48 bytes  
are available in each packet for the net 
data transfer but which places less heavy 
demands on device implementation, and  
a 1,014-byte mode that is more complex  
to implement.  

With MOST 25, between 0 and a maxi-
mum of 36 bytes of a data frame can be 
 assigned to the asynchronous channel, 
which corresponds to a maximum gross 
bandwidth of 12.7 MBit/s. For the 1,014-
byte mode, this produces a maximum net 
bandwidth of almost 11 MBit/s, and a data 
rate of almost 3 MBit/s for the 48-byte 
mode. In practice, however, substantially 
lower data rates are achieved mainly due 
to restrictions in device implementations.
The transmission of data packets on the 
asynchronous channel is also directly sup-
ported by the NIC. Likewise, a packet on 
the asynchronous channel contains a CRC 
to permit detection of simple transmission 
errors. Unlike the control channel, how-
ever, there is no issuing of automatic re-
peat requests on the data link layer.

To ensure reliable transfer and flow con-
trol in the large data volumes typical of the 
asynchronous channel, it is conventional 
to use yet another transport protocol that 
is implemented in a higher driver layer. 
This may either be the MOST high protocol 
(MHP), developed specifically for the 
MOST, or the popular TCP/IP protocol, 
which is set up on an appropriate adapta-
tion layer known as the MOST asynchro-
nous medium access control (MAMAC).

Administrative functions
The MOST standard defines the following 
administrative services that are required 
for the operation of a MOST system.

Configuration status
A valid configuration status in the MOST 
system is the prerequisite for communica-
tion in the application layer. The configu-
ration of the MOST system is managed by  
a single device, the network master. An ap-
plicative communication is only permitted 
once this device has signaled a conflict-
free configuration status.
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  OK configuration status: the network 

master transmits the OK configuration 
status as soon as a conflict-free configu-
ration is achieved.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  NotOK configuration status: if a conflict 
arises, e.g. because two devices have  
the same address, the network master 
transmits its NotOK configuration status. 
In response to this, all devices initialize 
their addresses and communication set-
tings.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  New and Invalid configuration statuses: 
these configuration statuses indicate 
that a new application (FBlock) has  
been registered in the system or that a 
previously registered application has 
dropped out.

NetBlock
It is mandatory for each device to imple-
ment an FBlock called the NetBlock, which 
covers a range of different administrative 
functions (e.g. for address initialization) 
and supplies information about the device 
and the FBlocks that it implements.

Network master
The network master is implemented by  
a special device in a MOST system and  
is responsible for system configuration.  
In present-day systems, the network mas-
ter is usually realized by the headunit  
(i.e. the control element) of the infotain-
ment system. This device often assumes 
the role of timing master too, but this does 

not necessarily have to be the case. The 
other devices in the MOST system in this 
relationship are known as network slaves.
The network master manages an image 

of the current configuration of a MOST 
system in the central registry. In addition 
to the addresses of all devices, this also 
contains all FBlocks implemented by them 
(down to the system FBlocks such as the 
NetBlock). A network slave searching for 
the device address for a particular FBlock 
may request it from the network master. 
If a network slave frequently accesses 
other devices, it may, for faster access, also 
store a local copy of the central registry –  
a decentral registry – which it must update 
accordingly in the event of any change in 
the configuration.

To build the central registry, the net-
work master carries out a network scan 
when the system starts and as soon as  
a network change event has occurred. 
 During this scan, it queries the NetBlocks 
of all devices for the FBlocks implemented  
by this device. If it detects a conflict while 
doing so, e.g. duplicate device address or 
duplicate instance of an FBlock, it takes 
measures to resolve the conflict. To do 
this, the network master may initiate a 
 recalculation of addresses, convert the  
InstId of an FBlock or, if necessary,  
ignore a device. 

Connection master
The connection master manages the syn-
chronous connections existent in the MOST 
system at a given time. It makes available  
a table containing information about all  
the connections currently present in the 
MOST system (SyncConnectionTable).  
It also makes it possible to query the band-
width remaining for further synchronous 
connections (AvailableChannels).

On request, the connection master 
builds connections between a specific 
source and sink (BuildSyncConnection) or 
removes them (RemoveSyncConnection) 
by sending the necessary commands to  
the associated FBlocks. 

Bus systems  |  MOST bus     107

Table 1

It is even possible to dispense with the 
connection master completely if a central 
entity in a MOST system, e.g. the headunit, 
is responsible for the administration of the 
synchronous channels.

MOST application layer
The MOST standard defines a suitable pro-
tocol in the application layer for the trans-
mission of control commands, status infor-
mation and events. This protocol makes it 
possible to address a specific function of 
an application interface (i.e. of an FBlock) 
that is provided by any device within the 
MOST system. For example, it is possible 
to start playback of a CD on a separate  
CD player or to query the number of the 
track currently playing in it. While the 
MOST protocol is mainly applied to the 
control channel, it can be transferred 
across the asynchronous channel if 
 necessary.

Overview
The protocol for MOST control messages 
provides for the following elements of a 
control message (Table 1):
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The address of a device in the MOST sys-

tem (DeviceID)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  An identifier for an FBlock implemented 

by this device (FBlockID) and its in-
stance in the MOST system (InstID)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The identifier for the requested function 

within the FBlock (FktID)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The type of operation (OpType) that 

should be applied to this function, e.g. 
the setting or querying of a property of 
the FBlock

Function block (FBlock)
A function block (FBlock) defines the in-
terface of a specific application or system 
service. An FBlock is assigned an address 
comprising an 8-bit FBlockID, which spec-
ifies the type of FBlock, and an additional 
8-bit InstID. The latter is a means of distin-
guishing between several instances of 
FBlocks of the same type in a MOST sys-
tem. 

An FBlock that is controlled by an asso-
ciated application, and the device that im-
plements the FBlock, are known as the 
slave in this relationship (e.g. an applica-
tion that addresses an external CD player 
through the associated FBlock). The appli-
cation that controls the FBlock is called 
the controller.

The functions that an FBlock possesses 
are defined by the function catalog. In the 
case of system services, the function cata-
logs are defined by the MOST standard. 
The MOST standard even defines the inter-
faces for common applications from the 
area of vehicle infotainment systems (e.g. 
for an amplifier or a CD player/changer). 
However, these interfaces tend to be ex-
tended by the system manufacturer. Other 
proprietary FBlocks are defined in their 
entirety by the system or device manufac-
turer.

108     Bus systems  |  MOST bus

Data field
The data field of the control message con-
tains the parameter values for a function 
call or its results. The data field is inter-
preted as specified in the definition of the 
function concerned and may contain one 
or more parameter values.

The MOST standard defines the following 
parameter types:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Boolean and BitField for individual 

 boolean values (1 byte) or sequence  
of individual bits (1, 2 and 4 bytes).

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Enum for enumerations. 
  Unsigned and signed byte, word and 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

long for integer values with or without 
sign and a size of 1, 2 or 4 bytes.
  String for character strings. These  
are zero terminated and contain a 
 description of the character coding  
in the first byte.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Stream, ClassifiedStream and 

 ShortStream for various types of  
byte sequences of any length.

A parameter type for real numbers does 
not exist. The MOST standard provides for 
real numbers represented as fixed-point 
values by the integer parameter types. 
More complex data types are not defined 
in the standard either. These have to be 
 realized by function classes instead.

Functions and operations
A function block is made up of several 
functions that are addressed with a 12-bit 
FktID. Depending on the type of function, 
the function may be assigned differently 
predefined operations, which are de-
scribed by a 4-bit OpType identifier. In the 
case of functions, a further distinction is 
made between methods and properties.
A method describes an action that an 
FBlock is able to execute, e.g. starting the 
station scan of a radio tuner. A method  
can be initiated by the controller using a 
Start or StartResult operation. In response, 
the slave returns a corresponding result 
message if applicable (for StartResult).  
If this result is not made available within  
a specific period, the controller is notified 
that the method is still being processed by 
means of a processing message. In the end, 
a method may even be terminated by the 
sending of an abort message.

A property describes a particular attri-
bute of the FBlock, such as the number of 
the track currently playing. A property 
such as this can be requested (Get opera-
tions) or set (Set or SetGet operations)  
by the controller. As the result of such a 
query, the slave responds with a status 
message, if applicable (for Get and SetGet), 
containing the current contents of the 
property.

Furthermore, the MOST standard pro-
vides for a notification service with which 
a controller may register with a slave for 
certain properties. If the value of one of 
these properties changes, all controllers 
that have registered for notification are in-
formed of the change by a status message.

Bus systems  |  MOST bus  

109

Function classes
To standardize the way in which functions 
are defined, the MOST standard specifies 
a series of function classes for proper-
ties. These determine which properties 
the function has and which operations are 
permissible. 

In addition to simple function classes 

(with a single parameter for numerical 
values or texts), there also exist complex, 
composite function classes. These are 
used to represent composite data struc-
tures such as records and arrays. They can 
also be nested at a specific nesting depth, 
which makes it possible to create two-
dimensional arrays or arrays of records, 
for example. These nested data structures 
are, for example, used to represent the 
phone book of a mobile phone. 

With multidimensional function classes, 

the two parameters PosX and PosY are 
used to address a particular position in the 
first or second dimension, where 0 always 
stands for all elements of this dimension. 
This makes it possible to access not only a 
specific element but also an entire line of a 
two dimensional array.

Applications
As well as defining the lower layers neces-
sary for data transfer, the MOST standard 
defines the interfaces for typical applica-
tions from the area of vehicle infotainment 
systems, e.g. a CD changer, amplifier or 
radio tuner.

The FBlocks defined by the MOST 
 Cooperation are summarized in a func-
tion catalog and listed with their current 
versions in the next section. The function 
catalog defines in detail all functions for 
the FBlocks contained in them as well 
as the permissible operations and their 
 parameters.

For the function catalog, there is a 

 machine-readable description available in 
XML format that can be used to import the 
catalog into various MOST tools.

In addition to the function catalog’s 
description of all functions of an FBlock, 
developments are underway to specify 
the dynamic behavior for the use of an 
FBlock. This involves the use of message 
sequence charts (MSCs) compliant with the 
MSC 2000 standard but with minor, MOST-
specific enhancements. 

Functions required by various applica-
tions, e.g. the aforementioned functions 
for managing sources for multimedia data, 
are defined in the GeneralFBlock. This is 
used as a function compilation, i.e. when a 
new FBlock is defined, all necessary func-
tions are copied from the GeneralFBlock to 
the new FBlock.

TTP/C

Overview
The Time-Triggered Protocol for SAE 
Class C networks (TTP/C) is a time-con-
trolled protocol in which the network us-
ers transfer data in special time intervals 
determined in advance. In other words, all 
network users have a global time defini-
tion which is determined by means of a 
time-synchronization protocol. 

TTP/C was developed specially to satisfy 

real-time requirements in distributed, 
fault-tolerant systems. It was developed 
specifically with a view to its use in the 
automotive field, but has in the meantime 
also come to be used in other fields, such 
aviation and railroads.

According to the requirements of the 
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) for 
Class C protocols, TTP/C is a protocol for 
high-speed networks (>125 kbit/s bit rate) 
which can be used for real-time commu-
nication in check systems. For this reason, 
particular emphasis was placed during 
development on the fields of fault detec-
tion and tolerance, robustness against mal-
functions, composability, and guaranteed 
latencies.

TTP/C is based on the principle of 
Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), a 
framework for developing highly reliable, 
distributed real-time systems and the ap-
plications that run on them.

The development of TTP/C dates back 
to the MARS project (Maintainable Real-
Time System), which was conducted in 
1979 at the Technical University of Berlin. 
Further development followed within the 
framework of further projects, such as 
TTA (Time-Triggered Architecture) or the 
Brite-EuRam III project “Safety Related 
Fault Tolerant Systems in Vehicles (X-by-
Wire)”, in which systems for activating 
safety-relevant automotive components, 
such as brakes or steering systems, via 
electronic networks without a mechanical 
fallback level were examined.

Areas of application
TTP/C was originally developed for use 
in safety-relevant systems in the automo-
tive field. Because the core functions of 
TTP/C were formally verified and a TTP/C 
network can be put together economically 
compared with other protocols with simi-
lar reliability properties, TTP/C has also in 
the meantime come to be used in aircraft, 
a field which is subject to very stringent 
requirements with regard to safeguarding 
functionality. TTP/C is also used in train 
control systems.

Fault-tolerance strategy
The fault-tolerance strategy is used to 
describe which faults can be detected 
and handled. TTP/C is able to detect and 
handle each individually occurring fault 
(Single Fault Hypothesis). In addition, a se-
ries of multiple fault scenarios is handled.
However, some important multiple fault 

scenarios, such as a complete temporary 
breakdown of communication for example, 
cannot be detected on the node level. Ad-
ditional methods of fault detection and 
handling are required on the application 
level for this purpose.

The TTP/C network must consist of at 
least four real member nodes to ensure 
that all single faults are detected.

The network ensures on the architecture 

level that a faulty network node cannot 
prevent any properly functioning network 
node from transmitting its message. This is 
done by bus guardians, which permit bus 
access only at defined points in time.

Time-Triggered Architecture
Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA) forms 
the basis on which the TTP/C protocol was 
specified (Fig. 1). The core element of TTA 
is the network node, which comprises a 
host processor and a TTP/C controller, 
referred to in the following as the control-
ler. The network node is the “Smallest Re-
placeable Unit” (SRU) in a TTP/C system. 
The host processor processes inputs from 

112     Bus systems  |  TTP/C

sensors and activates actuators. The Com-
munication Network Interface (CNI) forms 
the interface between the host processor 
and the controller and provides memory 
areas via which the host processor and the 
controller can exchange information.

The controller is in the end connected to 
the TTP/C bus, by way of which it connects 
the node with other nodes. The group of 
all the nodes connected to a TTP/C bus and 
the bus forms a cluster.

Host Processor
The host processor executes the applica-
tion, the actual function of the network 
node. In order to support the application, 
an operating system, which also for the 
most part provides the FT-COM layer, runs 
on the host processor as well as the ap-
plication. The FT-COM layer introduces a 
further abstraction level of the technical 
realization of communication. The applica-
tion can provide data for transfer via the 
interfaces of the FT-COM layer, thanks to 
which the application designer does not 
have to deal with deeper concepts, such as 
the memory areas in the CNI.

Communication Network Interface (CNI)
The CNI functions as a temporary firewall 
because it makes available a memory area 
via which data received and to be sent are 
exchanged between the host processor 
and the controller. This interface repre-
sents the host processor’s sole possibility 
of transferring information via the net-
work. It is therefore not possible for the 
host processor to influence the communi-
cation sequence. In particular, the point in 
time at which information is provided by 
the host processor has no influence on the 
network’s communication sequence. 

TTP/C Controller
The controller (Fig. 2) operates entirely 
independently of the host processor. Its 
most important components are the proto-
col processor, a local bus guardian, and the 
Message Descriptor List (MEDL).

The function of the protocol proces-
sor is to prepare information provided 
by the host processor in the CNI in such a 
way that they can be transferred as TTP/C 
frames.

The controller is connected via two in-
terfaces with the remaining components 
of the network node. The connections to 
the host processor and to the transceivers 
(drivers) are established via the CNI and 
the Logical Line Interface respectively.

Message Descriptor List (MEDL)
The MEDL contains all the check informa-
tion required by the controller to send and 
receive data. It is a list adapted for each 
controller containing, for example, infor-
mation on the position and size of transmit 
and receive slots.

The information stored in the MEDL 
includes the points in time at which the 
controller frame may be transmitted and 
at which frames of other controllers are 
expected which are processed by the host 
processor.

CNI memory positions in which informa-

tion from the host processor is to be pro-
vided for transfer and in which received 
information from the controller is to be 
stored are also defined in the MEDL.
The MEDL also contains further in-
formation needed for the operation. For 
example, the identification of frames used 
to synchronize the internal clocks and the 
synchronization times.

2 TTP/C node

Strictly speaking, the designation Message 
Descriptor List is incorrect. Information 
blocks within a frame are designated as 
messages in TTP/C (Fig. 3). However, this 
structure exists only from the perspec-
tive of the host processor, not from the 
perspective of the controller, which only 
processes frames. The designations has 
persisted, however, because it was intro-
duced in earlier specifications.

Local and Central Bus Guardians
The primary function of the bus guardian 
is to limit transmissions of a node to the 
defined time windows. For this purpose, 
it accesses the information of the MEDL 
in which the transmit slots of the node are 
stored.

There are two different types of bus 
guardians. Local bus guardians are con-
nected between the controller and the 
TTP/C bus and prevent bus access out-
side defined transmit slots. Central bus 
guardians operate in a central coupler. 
If exclusively central bus guardians are 
used, however, only faults are excluded for 
the nodes which are directly connected to 
the couplers. Connected bus topologies, 
on the other hand, cannot be completely 
protected.

In addition to monitoring bus access, the 
central bus guardian can also assume the 
function of detecting and containing SOS 
faults (Slightly-Off Specification). These 
are faults in which a node continually vio-
lates slightly one or more communication 
parameters, such as the voltages used or 
the timing of the transmit slots. The upshot 
of this is that some network nodes which 
were designed with greater tolerances 
process these messages, but other reject 
them as faulty. As a result of SOS faults, it 
becomes problematic to establish whether 
data have been correctly transmitted or 
incorrectly received.

Logical Line Interface
The Logical Line Interface (LLI) is the 
interface between the controller and the 
transceiver (driver). The LLI establishes 
the structure of the logical information in 
which the driver must accept information 
to be transmitted and in which it must pro-
vide received information. This makes it 
easier to adapt controllers to a new trans-
mission medium since only the drivers 
have to be modified; however, the format 
of the interface to the rest of the system 
remains unchanged.

Driver
The driver is the transceiver for the trans-
mission medium. It converts the physical 
states of the TTP/C bus into logic states, 
which can be processed by the controller.

Network
Network Size
TTP/C is designed for networks of up to 
64 nodes. A TTP/C network can consist of 
a minimum of two nodes, but at least four 
nodes are required to satisfy the Single 
Fault Hypothesis. A problem in the data 
transfer lies in the danger that a transfer is 
not received uniformly by all the network 
nodes. If there are at least four real mem-
ber nodes (nodes with sole access to one 
transmit slot) in a TTP/C network, TTP/C 
can identify reliably whether the message 
transmission was successful or whether 
faults occurred during transmission or 
reception.

Topology
All TTP/C networks have two independent 
physical channels via which a network 
node simultaneously transmits information 
redundantly. This configuration is required 
in order that the Single Fault  Hypothesis, 
i.e. the handling of the failure of any com-
ponent, can be satisfied. However, it is also 
possible for nodes which do not fulfill any 
safety-relevant functions to be connected 
only to one of the two channels.

Since a controller always forwards 
messages via the LLI to its drivers, it is 
possible to adapt TTP/C to very different 
topologies. Bus, star and hybrid topologies 
from any combinations of bus and star to-
pologies are described (Fig. 4) in the TTP/C 
Specification (Version 1.1).

 

Bus systems  |  TTP/C     115

Bus topology
In a bus, all the network nodes are con-
nected in series to central cables. If a bus 
topology is used, the structure dictates 
that no central bus guardians can be used. 
However, the overall length of the cabling 
can be reduced to a minimum for this pur-
pose.

Star topology
If a star topology is used, the network 
nodes are connected to each other via cen-
tral couplers. Here, each TTP/C channel is 
brought together in its own coupler.

Star topologies facilitate the use of cen-
tral bus guardians, which are able to pro-
vide additional protection against faults.

Hybrid topologies of bus and star
Even hybrid technologies composed of bus 
and star topologies can be built. For ex-
ample, it is possible to cascade several star 
topologies into a multi-star or to connect a 
sub-bus to a star topology.

Transmission Media
Within a TTP/C network, communication 
takes place via two channels. The channels 
are designated Channel 0 (Ch0) and Chan-
nel 1 (Ch1), or Channel A (ChA) and Chan-
nel B (ChB).

Because the TTP/C Specification is 
formulated very openly with regard to 
the transmission medium, it is possible 
to build TTP/C networks using very dif-
ferent media. Both electrical and optical 
media can be used here. In particular, it is 
also possible to design one channel to be 
optical and the other to be electrical. Dif-
ferences in the latencies of the different 
media can be compensated for by way of 
the configuration in the MEDL.

The achievable bit rate also varies to-
gether with this flexibility; however, the bit 
rate itself is fixed during operation within 
a network and cannot be altered. 

It is possible with current implemen-

tations to achieve bit rates of 5 Mbit/s 
for asynchronous data transfer during 
system starting and of up to 25 Mbit/s for 
synchronous data transfer during normal 
operation. Prototypes in the laboratory 
environment has achieved bit rates of up 
to 1 Gbit/s.

Communication cycle
TTP/C controls bus access by means of a 
TDMA process (Time Division Multiple 
 Access, Fig. 5). Here, the available band-
width is divided into time windows (slots) 
in which in each case an established net-
work node can utilize the network’s full 
bandwidth.

TTP/C distinguishes between rounds 
and cycles in the sequence of slots. All 
rounds contain the same sequence of 
slots whose size can be independently 
established. A cycle is a defined sequence 
of rounds in which the individual rounds 
differ only in the content of the individual 
slots, but not in the sequence of size of the 
slots.

In round, each member node of the 
cluster transmits one frame precisely in 
one slot. A distinction is made here be-
tween two types of member node: real 
and virtual. Real member nodes are nodes 
which have their own transmit slot which 
only this node can access. Virtual member 
nodes consist of a group of nodes which 
use a common transmit slot. This structure 
is used to build up redundant structures 
(Fault Tolerant Unit, FTU) which make the 
failure of nodes more tolerable.

FTUs are used so that safety-relevant 
information can also be provided in the 
event of the failure or one or more net-
work nodes. Here, all the nodes combined 
in a FTU are able to process a task and use 
in a cycle alternately the transmit slot of a 
round allocated to the FTU.

Passive Nodes
A node transfers data only when current 
data are available for transfer, otherwise 
it remains silent. A node which does not 
transfer any data in its transmit slot is 
a passive node. This is the standard be-
havior when the controller of the node 
establishes that its host has not updated 
the “Host Life Sign”, by means of which 
an application signals that it is active. The 
controller then assumes that the applica-
tion cannot generate any valid data and 
does not transmit.

This mechanism is also used for monitor 

nodes, which merely monitor the commu-
nication of the other nodes, but themselves 
do not influence the communication.

Time control
The time window of a slot can be subdi-
vided using the performed activities into 
different phases (Fig. 6). Before a node 
can transmit information, it needs time in 
order to read in the transmission param-
eters or to prepare the transceivers. This 
phase is called the Pre-Send Phase (PSP). 
This is followed by the time interval in 
which information is actually transmitted 
via the network, the Transmission Phase 
(TP). After a message has been received, 
a node needs time in order to prepare the 
information. This takes pace in the Post-
Receive Phase (PRP). Because the time 
needed for PSP and PRP is not fixed, the 
PRP is followed by the Idle Phase, a phase 
through which the length of a node slots 
is stretched to the time interval defined in 
the MEDL.

Bus systems  |  TTP/C     117

A TDMA slot is fixed at points in time 
which can be observed using the transmis-
sion. But because this is not applicable to 
all the activities of a controller during a 
slot, a distinction is made between node 
slot and TDMA slot. 

For a node, the slot begins with the PSP. 
But because no signal is transmitted in this 
phase, external observers lack a precise 
point in time at which the node slot begins.
The first precise point in time which can 
be observed from an external source is the 
start of the TP. This point is also called the 
Action Time (AT). A TDMA slot therefore 
comprises the time interval which passes 
between two ATs. Therefore, there exists 
in a TDMA slot only the TP and the Inter-
frame Gap (IFG), in which the PRP, Idle 
Phase and PSP are combined.

A node slot, on the other hand, begins 
with the PSP, which is followed by the TP, 
the PRP and the Idle Phase.

TTP/C Protocol
TTP/C systems use the TTA framework 
(Time-Triggered Architecture) as the basis 
for which – with the exception of the appli-
cation – finished solutions can be used.

The TTA protocol stack (Fig. 7) can be 

divided hierarchically into three areas. 
The top layer is the host layer, the ex-
ecuted application. Under this is the FT-

COM layer, also an application, which is 
processed on the host processor.

The lower layers are implemented in 
the controller, where data communication 
takes place between the host processor 
and the controller via the CNI interface. 

In the controller, the top layer is the Pro-

tocol Service Layer; under this is the Data 
Link Layer followed at the lowest level by 
the Physical Layer.

Physical Layer
The Physical Layer comprises the require-
ments which are placed on the physical 
transmission of information. Often the 
connections to be used, the cable types or 
the voltage levels are established for this 
purpose in a protocol specification.

Efforts are indeed underway to formu-
late a specification for a TTP/C physical 
layer, but the TTP/C protocol specification 
merely establishes requirements which 
must be fulfilled by the physical layer 
used. This has the advantage that the pro-
tocol is very flexible with regard to the 
networking and bit rate. It is thus possible, 
for example, for networking to use both 
optical and electrical media, which can 
also be combined with each other.

However, the system designer is faced 

with the problem of initially having to 
identify and evaluate possible solutions.

FT-COM Layer
The FT-COM Layer offers functions for 
realizing replicated, distributed applica-
tions. These include redundancy control 
and the decision as to whether replicated 
messages of other nodes are correct.

In order to allow applications standard-

ized access to communication data, the 
FT-COM Layer offers an interface similar 
to CNI in which the data for the Host Layer 
applications are provided.

Host Layer
The Host Layer comprises the applications 
which run on the host processor. In addi-
tion to the actual applications, these in-
clude the operating system and the check 
structures (control loops).

In order to give the communication sys-
tem as modular a structure as possible, the 
applications of this layer should access the 
FT-COM interface and not the CNI. This 
makes it possible, for example, for an ap-
plication which previously ran on a real 
member node to be switched with minimal 
complexity to a series of virtual member 
nodes.

Essentially, three requirement are placed 
on the physical layer:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Two independent physical transmission 

channels must exist.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The transmission channel must permit 

distributed broadcast transmissions, i.e. 
transmissions which are received by all 
the network users.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The delay which occurs during the 

transmission of information via a me-
dium (Propagation Delay) must be 
known.

Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer contains the functions 
which are needed to transmit frames be-
tween nodes. These include the structures 
which are required for access to the trans-
mission channels and for the transmission 
of frames. In particular, the Data Link 
Layer establishes the format of the mes-
sage frames.

Protocol Service Layer
The Protocol Service Layer is responsible 
for implementing the protocol services of-
fered. Here, a distinction is made between 
communication services, safety services 
and higher-level services.

The functions of the communication ser-
vices are the safeguarding of reliable data 
transfer, startup of a cluster, reintegration 
of member nodes in the cluster, transmis-
sion acknowledgment, and fault-tolerant 
clock synchronization.

The safety services include the manage-

ment of node membership, avoidance of 
cliques, and the independent bus guardian.
The higher-level services include func-
tions for delayed mode changes, distrib-
uted alarm, external clock synchroniza-
tion, or reconfiguration of a node.

Protocol services
Cluster Startup
All the nodes of a cluster act without syn-
chronization during cluster startup; bus 
access is therefore not yet controlled via 
TDMA. Because there is always a trans-
mission delay caused by the medium 
used when messages are distributed in a 
network, two unsynchronized nodes of a 
cluster can start simultaneously with the 
message transmission if the transmission 
delay is greater than the duration of the 
startframe. This can occur during system 
startup if several nodes are authorized to 
initiate synchronization (coldstart nodes).
The situation can arise where different 
cliques arise within one cluster of which 
only the nodes of one clique are synchro-
nized, but not all the nodes of the cluster.
In order to avoid this, all the nodes re-
ject the first correctly received coldstart 
frame. The coldstart nodes wait for a time 
interval (startup timeout) before trying 
again to transmit a coldstart frame. Be-
cause the size of the startup timeout must 
be different for all the coldstart nodes in 
the cluster and differ at least by the size 
of the transmission delay, collisions can 
no longer occur during the second cluster 
startup. This process is also known as  
“Big Bang”.

Synchronization
In a communication system which controls 
bus access by means of TDMA, it is impor-
tant for the individual users to have as pre-
cise an idea as possible of a global time.

Synchronization in a TTP/C system uses 
for the operation time only the offset cor-
rection by means of which the onset of a 
point in time is synchronized to all the in-
ternal clocks of the nodes of a cluster. For 
this purpose, TTP/C uses a variant of the 
Welch-Lynch algorithm 1) which was de-
scribed by Kopetz and Ochsenreiter 2).

The internal clocks of the network nodes 
of a cluster can run with different levels of 
precision. Only nodes which have precise 
clocks should be used for time synchro-
nization. These nodes receive the flag as 
“Master Clocks” in the MEDL, whereby 
the SYF (Synchronization Frame Flag) 
is set for their frames. Nodes with more 
imprecise internal clocks act as “Slave 
Clocks” and use the clock information of 
the master clocks. There must be at least 
four master clocks in a cluster to ensure 
that clock synchronization is Byzantine-
fault-tolerant. Byzantine faults are faults in 
which different nodes interpret the same 
transmission differently.

The nodes of a cluster are synchronized 

by measuring the Action Time (AT) in 
each transmitted slot. If the SYF flag of a 
frame is set and the received frame was 
faultlessly received, the AT of the frame is 
stored in a stack four deep. In other words, 
the last four correction values determined 
are stored in the stack. 

The actual clock synchronization takes 

place in frames, for which the ClkSyn 
flag (Clock Synchronization) is set in the 
MEDL. If this is the case, the mean value 
is formed from the stack values, where 
the highest and lowest values are ignored. 
The internal clock is now corrected by the 
calculated mean value.

TTP/C also supports the inclusion of 
external reference clocks (e.g. GPS) in the 
system. Time Gateway Hosts are nodes of 
this type which offer an external time ref-
erence. These nodes transmit the external 
correction value as application data in a 
frame. The remaining nodes of the cluster 
store this value in the CNI and include it in 
the calculation of the AT correction values.

120     Bus systems  |  TTP/C

Membership Service
TTP/C uses Membership Service to ensure 
that all the nodes of a cluster at each point 
in time have the same consistent view as 
to which nodes are present in the network 
and which are not. For this purpose, each 
node carries a member vector in which it 
notes whether the last received transmis-
sion of a node has run correctly. If a node 
receives a message incorrectly, it changes 
the entry of the message sender to “incor-
rect”.

By comparing the member vectors of 
the following frames, a calibration is made 
with the remaining nodes of the cluster. 

Clique Avoidance
In order to achieve correspondence within 
the cluster with regard to the current state 
of the cluster, it is necessary to prevent the 
formation within the cluster of subgroups 
or cliques whose view of the current state 
differs from the real state of the cluster.
To prevent the formation of cliques, 
each node logs how many transmissions 
were successfully and how many were in-
correct. 

Before it can transmit a frame itself, 
the Clique Avoidance Algorithm is used. 
The controller checks whether more suc-
cessful transmissions were received than 
incorrect transmissions. Only if this is the 
case does the node set both counters to 
zero and transmit its frame. If this is not 
the case, the controller switches to the 
“Freeze” state, in which the controller is 
deactivated and no data are transmitted. 
From this state, it can be placed by the 
host processor in the initialization mode 
again.

Transmission acknowledgment
TTP/C offers an implicit transmission ac-
knowledgment. Because the member vec-
tor of the next sender in the round is also 
transmitted as part of the frame, the origi-
nal sender can check whether its transmis-
sion was correctly received.

But because the successor may be faulty, 
the sender also observes the transmission 
of the second successor. If the latter iden-
tifies in its member vector that it has also 
received the transmission incorrectly, this 
means for the sender that a transmit fault 
has occurred at its end. If the second suc-
cessor has received the message correctly, 
the first successor detects that a receive 
fault has occurred.

Measures can now be taken to handle 

both fault types.

Controller State (C-State)
In order for the applications executed on 
the host processors to be able to deliver 
consistent results, it is necessary that 
all the nodes of a cluster share common 
knowledge of the state of the cluster. This 
knowledge is summarized in the C-state.
Each node may indeed determine its C-
state independently, but the cluster agrees 
by comparison with the other nodes to the 
view of the majority of the users.

The controller state is influenced by the 
values for global time, current position in 
the TDMA round (MEDL position), current 
cluster mode, requested mode change 
(DMC), and the member vector.

Bus systems  |  TTP/C     121

Cluster Mode
In many real-time systems, operation 
and check functions can be divided into 
phases which are mutually exclusive. For 
example, the operation of a motor vehicle 
could be divided into the phases “Driv-
ing” and “Stationary”. In order to support 
the different requirements placed on the 
exchange of information in the different 
phases, it is possible to define in a TTP/C 
network modes in which the transmitted 
information in a frame can vary. However, 
the order of the slot in a TDMA round is 
the same in all modes.

For the purpose of correct interpreta-
tion, it is therefore necessary when modes 
are used for all the nodes of a cluster to be 
in the same mode.

Deferred Pending Mode Change (DMC)
A change of cluster mode can be initi-
ated by applications if the controller is 
permitted in the MEDL to change to the 
requested new mode.

Because the change of cluster mode 
comes into force only at the beginning of 
the following cycle, the information for 
the deferred pending mode change is re-
corded in the C-state.

If another change of cluster mode is re-
quested by another application later in the 
cluster cycle, this request overwrites the 
previous request. A special case is CPM 
(Clear Pending Mode change), in which an 
application prevents the requested change 
of cluster mode.

Reintegration of a node
A node must synchronize itself with the 
cluster if it has failed due to an incorrect 
transmission from the member vector or 
if it has been re-initialized. To this end, it 
waits for a frame in which an explicit  
C-state was transmitted, e.g. an initializa-
tion frame. The controller adopts this  
C-state and uses it for its transmission.

In order for this to be able to function, 
a frame with an explicit C-state must be 
transmitted every two rounds. If this is not 

the case, the controller assumes that there 
has been a communication fault and begins 
with a cluster startup.

Frame format
Because TTP/C regulates bus access via 
TDMA, all messages are transmitted in 
broadcast mode and a priori knowledge 
of the communication sequence and its 
content is present in the MEDL, it is pos-
sible to keep very low the overhead of the 
protocol, i.e. the volume of information 
needed to process the frame.

Two different frame types are used in 
the operation of a cluster (Fig. 8). Cold-
start Frames, also known as Initialization 
Frames or I-Frames, occur exclusively 
during system startup. Normal Frames, 
also known as N-Frames, are used for 
 communication during normal operation.

I-Frame
An I-frame begins with the TTP/C header. 
This is followed by the current controller 
C-state and finally the CRC value of the 
frame.

N-Frame
To ensure that Membership Service can 
function, it is necessary for the C-state to 
be included in the frame structure. This 
can occur explicitly or implicitly in the 
case of N-frames.

If the C-State is explicitly transmitted, 
the header is followed by the controller  
C-state. This is followed by application 
data and then the CRC value of the frame.

If the C-State is implicitly included in the 

frame, the frame consists of the header, 
application data and finally the CRC value 
of the frame, the determination of which 
was initialized with the current C-state.
Download frames are a special form 
of the N-frame; these are accepted by all 
the receiving nodes, regardless of cluster 
association and C-state. To facilitate this 
behavior, a constant value which is known 
to all the nodes is used for these frames to 
determine the CRC.

Frame Fields
Header
The header of all the TTP/C frames is 
identical. Firstly, one bit signals the frame 
type, whether an I-frame or an N-frame is 
transmitted. 

This is followed by three bits, by means 
of which a change of current cluster mode 
can be requested. These bits are set to 
zero if no change has been requested.

Application data
The information of the application is trans-
mitted in this area. The size of this field 
can be determined for each slot of a round 
individually in the MEDL and must not 
 exceed 240 bytes per slot.

C-state
The C-state consists of the global time, 
information on the MEDL and the member 
vector of the cluster. The MEDL position 
corresponding to the Round Slot Position 
in the current cluster mode, the current 
cluster mode and the requested cluster 
mode change (DMC) is transmitted as in-
formation on the MEDL.

An explicit C-state has a size of 96 bits 

(six words of two bytes each).

CRC checksum
TTP/C uses the CRC checksum only to 
identify transmission faults. Transmission 
faults are not corrected. Transmission 
faults are detected by a process whereby 
each node determines a CRC checksum for 
the received message and compares this 
with the transmitted checksum.

A polynomial is used to determine the 
checksum. The TTP/C Specification in this 
respect does not stipulate a specific poly-
nomial; instead, it requires the polynomial 
to facilitate a Hamming distance of at 
least 6. In other words, it must be possible 
within one transmission for at least five in-
correctly transmitted bits to be detected.

The CRC calculation is initialized by the 
Schedule ID, where the ID is split into two 
parts. One part is used for initialization 
for Channel 0 and the other for Channel 1. 
This prevents a node which does not have 
the correct MEDL or which was connected 
crosswise to the channels from transmit-
ting or receiving successfully.

The C-state for initializing the CRC cal-
culation is also used in the transmission of 
frames with an implicit C-state. Thus, only 
those frames whose CRC checksum was 
determined with the same C-state are ac-
cepted as valid.

The calculated CRC value is transmitted 

at the end of a frame in a 3-byte field.

Composability
Networking technology has changed 
greatly over the years. Where initially 
stand-alone systems (e.g. activation of a 
turn-signal lamp via switches and relays) 
were used, the changeover was quickly 
made to cooperative systems in which 
individual components exchange informa-
tion with each other. 

However, the interaction of components 
is increasingly making it difficult to ensure 
the correct fulfillment of a function. For 
this reason, the aspect of composability, 
i.e. the possibility of combining separately 
developed subsystems into an overall sys-
tem without having to verify the function 
of the overall system again, is becoming 
increasingly important. 

In order to ensure that this functions, 
it is necessary to ensure that a subsystem 
autonomously fulfills its functions, but also 
that this is the case when the subsystem is 
integrated in an overall system.

TTP/C facilitates the implementation of 
composability through the communication 
parameters which are stored in the MEDL.

Verification of the Specification
The functionality of TTP/C has been thor-
oughly analyzed. The core algorithms 
of the protocol specification have been 
formally verified with regard to certain as-
pects of consistency, stability and safety.

Furthermore, the function of TTP/C sys-

tems has been tested using failure-injec-
tion experiments. This involved the use of 
both physical and software faults to check 
the fault tolerance and fault-detection 
properties.

Standardization
The development of TTA stretches back 
over a period of 20 years. Today, develop-
ment of the Specification is coordinated 
by the TTAgroup, a cross-industry consor-
tium which was founded by the companies 
Airbus, Audi, Delphi, Honeywell, PSA Peu-
geot Citroën, Renault, and TTTech.

The Specification of TTP/C has been in-
fluenced in particular by Hermann Kopetz, 
who between 1979 and 1982 was Profes-
sor of Computer Process Control at the 
Technical University of Berlin and since 
1982 has run the Institute for Technical 
Information Technology at the Technical 
University of Vienna. Professor Kopetz 
also directed the MARS project and was 
substantially involved in each further de-
velopment of the protocol.

bus access is controlled by the use of mini-
slots. Minislots are small time windows  
in which a defined message can be trans-
ferred. This access method is also known 
as FTDMA (Flexible Time Division Multi-
ple Access).

With messages transmitted in the static 
component of the cycle, the transfer prop-
erties can be assured in accordance with 
known methods. In the dynamic compo-
nent, messages are sent as required. In this 
case, messages are prioritized based on 
the message ID. The division between the 
static and dynamic component is freely 
configurable but it cannot be modified 
later during system operation. The same 
applies to the slot lengths in the static 
range, which, while configurable, must re-
main constant once operation is underway.
FlexRay systems can be equipped with 

two transmission channels, with each 
channel having separate lines. This makes 
it possible to create a redundant data 
transfer or increase the available band-
width for specific applications. The latter 
can be used both for the parallel transmis-
sion of information of two network nodes 
and for the faster transfer of information 
of one node.

FlexRay operates at a maximum bit rate 

of 10 MBit/s, which is achievable in opti-
mal environmental conditions. A rate of  
up to 20 MBit/s is achievable if two chan-
nels are used without redundant access.  
In addition to the bit rate of 10 MBit/s, 
which is the only bit rate defined in Speci-
fication 2.1 dated 15th December 2005, 
there are endeavors to support lower bit 
rates of 2.5 or 5 MBit/s.

FlexRay

Overview
FlexRay is a field that was designed to 
 support open and closed-loop control 
technologies in the automotive sector. 
 Development focused on the suitability  
for use in active safety systems in particu-
lar. FlexRay therefore offers transfers with 
guaranteed compliance with transfer 
properties, high bit rates and a fault-
 tolerant design.

The development of FlexRay, managed 
by the FlexRay Consortium, goes back to 
cooperation between German automotive 
manufacturers, BMW and DaimlerChrysler. 
In 1999 these two companies began to 
compile requirements for a new communi-
cation system. In the process, develop-
ment would incorporate experience 
gained from the byteflight system of  
BMW and the prototype development  
of  DaimlerChrysler.

The aim of FlexRay is to provide a sys-
tem with high transfer rates that will work 
in a deterministic and fault-tolerant man-
ner while being as flexible as possible to 
use and expand. The main fields of appli-
cation of the FlexRay are drivetrain sys-
tems (drive) and active safety systems with 
no mechanical fall-back level (x-by-wire). 
However, the areas of passive safety sys-
tems and comfort/convenience and body 
electronics are also supported.

To support these very different domains, 
FlexRay uses two different types of bus ac-
cess. For deterministic transfer properties, 
it offers time-controlled bus access. In the 
case of applications whose transfers place 
less demanding requirements on transfer 
properties, it is desirable to make as effec-
tive use of the available transfer capacity 
as possible. To combine these two ap-
proaches, communication takes place in 
cycles. In each cycle, there is firstly a static 
transmission component in which bus ac-
cess is controlled by TDMA (Time Division 
Multiple Access). There then follows a dy-
namic transmission component in which

Areas of application
The areas of application of the FlexRay are 
very diverse. By offering redundant, time-
controlled and fault-tolerant transfers,  
not only is FlexRay suitable for use in 
 active safety systems with no mechanical 
fall-back level and in the area of the drive-
train, but its optional, dynamic transmis-
sion range means that it is able to support 
application in the areas of passive safety 
systems and networking in the body and 
comfort/convenience domains.

With the high bandwidth of up to 
20 MBit/s for non-redundant transfers,  
it is even conceivable, in theory, that 
FlexRay could be used for the transfer  
of audio or highly compressed video.

Topology
Point-to-point
The simplest configuration of a FlexRay 
system is the direct link between two 
 network nodes. The maximum distance 
between the two nodes is 24 m in this 
 configuration.

Bus topology
Between 4 and 22 nodes can be connected 
in a bus topology. The maximum distance 
between any two nodes in a bus topology 
may be 24 m.

Star topology
A star topology is another architectural 
variant of the FlexRay network. Both ac-
tive and passive couplers are supported.

Passive star topology
3 to 22 nodes can be connected in a pas-
sive star. Here, too, the distance between 
any two nodes cannot be greater than 
24 m.

Active star topology
An active star topology can be viewed as  
a point-to-point link between a number  
of nodes and an active coupler. In this to-
pology, therefore, only the distance from  
a node to the coupler is of importance. 
This cannot be more than 24 m.

Apart from the connection lengths and 

the number of connectable nodes, the 
most important difference between an 
 active and a passive star topology is in  
the achievable bit rates. With the use of 
passive couplers, the achievable data  
rate (approx. 1 MBit/s) is below the rate  
that can be achieved with active couplers 
(up to 10 MBit/s).

Cascaded star topologies
Cascaded star topologies are the product 
of several active star topologies linked 
 together. In a FlexRay system, a topology 
like this is limited to three cascaded star 
topologies.

Hybrid topologies
Hybrid topologies are a blend of topolo-
gies from bus and star topologies, e.g. the 
connection of several bus topologies to a 
star topology instead of individual nodes.

Two-channel topologies
Since it is possible to implement both 
channels of a FlexRay system indepen-
dently, different topologies can be used  
for each channel. For example, one chan-
nel could be realized as an active star 
 topology, the other as a bus topology.

Hardware
FlexRay controller of a subscriber 
A FlexRay node (Fig. 1) comprises the  
host processor, a communication control-
ler (CC) and one bus driver (BD) for each 
channel to which the node is connected. 
Optionally, each node may contain a  
bus guardian (BG) for monitoring each  
bus driver and the bus guardian may re-
ceive information through an additional 
host processor.

It is optional whether a network node  

is connected to one or both channels;  
here, at the very most, the requirements 
from the field of application of the network 
node take effect.

Transmission agents
The transmission agent for a FlexRay sys-
tem is of a twisted-pair cabling design, 
where shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP) 
cabling may be used.

Each of the two FlexRay channels con-
sists of two wires designated bus plus (BP) 
and bus minus (BM).

Host processor
The host processor gathers information 
from the sensors, which is forwarded to 
the communication controller for trans-

mission. The information received by the 
communication controller is forwarded to 
the actuators responsible for processing.

Communication controller
The communication controller (CC) real-
izes all aspects of the FlexRay system 
 relating to the protocol. Its tasks include 
scheduling, synchronizing with other net-
work nodes, creating a macrotick signal, 
creating a bit stream from the information 
of the host or controlling bus access.

Bus driver
The bus driver (BD) assumes the role of a 
transceiver. It converts logical information 
into physical voltages that are carried on 
copper wires, and vice versa. The role of 
the BD also includes a protective function 
against electrostatic discharge (ESD).

Furthermore, the BD monitors the states 
of the BP and BM and is thereby able to de-
tect whether the bus is affected by physical 
faults.

The BD also processes wakeup signals 

and, optionally, is able to control the 
power management of the network node 
because functions of the node can be 
switched off.

Bus guardian
The bus guardian (BG) is a device that will 
only permit transmissions if the connected 
network node is authorized to send a mes-
sage. With this system, it is theoretically 
possible for faulty network nodes to inter-
fere at the very most with their own trans-
mission but not with the transmissions of 
other network nodes.

The FlexRay protocol only provides the 
framework for use of a BG: its use is not a 
mandatory specification. Specification 2.0 
only described a local bus guardian that 
would operate inside the network node 
and monitor access to one of the channels. 
A critical aspect of this concept was that 
correct operation of the bus guardian in a 
faulty network node could not be guaran-
teed as a consequence of the integration  
of the bus guardian in the node and the 
permission for the bus guardian to access 
the oscillator of the network node.

Specification 2.1 contains a refined 
 concept for the local bus guardian and 
 introduces the concept of a central bus 
guardian.

Local bus guardian
The local bus guardian (node-local bus 
guardian) is implemented as a stand-alone 
CC inside the network node that monitors 
operation of a CC (Fig. 2). Its synchroniza-
tion process is independent of that of the 
CC's; in particular, the CC and BG have 
 separate oscillators.

In addition, it is also possible for the BG 
and CC to be controlled by dedicated host 
processors that communicate with each 
other. This is, however, not mandatory.

As a consequence of direct control lines 

(bus-guardian enable, BGE) between the 
BG, CC and BD, information can only be 
transferred from the CC to the BD if the  
BG permits this transfer to take place.

Central bus guardian
The central bus guardian (CBG, Fig. 3) was 
a new feature introduced with Specifica-
tion 2.1. It operates in the coupler of a  
star topology and monitors the operation 
of all connected nodes or networks. Faults, 
such as short-circuits on buses or network 
nodes, that transmit information like a 
“babbling idiot” with no consideration of 
the transmission window, and thus inter-
fere with orderly communication, can be 
detected by a CBG and suitable counter-

measures may then be taken. As a result, 
the effects of these faults can be confined 
to small areas of the network.

the bus driver looks out for the transmis-
sion of a wakeup signal, in response to 
which the node is set to wakeup mode.

Operating modes
In addition to normal operation, a FlexRay 
system also supports the complete initial-
ization of the network from sleep to 
standby (Fig. 4). In order for this system 
start to function, the BDs of all network 
nodes have the capability to detect wakeup 
signals on the bus and to start the remain-
ing other components of the dedicated 
network node.

Special network nodes that may be con-

nected to the starter motor of a vehicle,  
for example, generate the wakeup signal. 

The system start is split into the wakeup 
and startup phases. The wakeup phase in-
volves the activation of the network nodes 
by the wakeup signal. In the startup phase, 
the network nodes are initialized and syn-
chronized.

If the function of a node is not required 
for the time being, the node can be set to  
a standby mode in which all operations  
of the coding and decoding process are 
stopped. This reduces the energy con-
sumption of the node. In sleep mode, the 
power consumption of a network node is 
at its minimum. In this mode, all functions 
of the network node are deactivated: only 

4 Wakeup sequence

Sending and receiving
A bus driver connects a FlexRay network 
node to the channel that contains a re-
ceiver and transmitter. If a controller is 
connected to both channels, it follows that 
there must be two receivers and transmit-
ters available in the network node.

FlexRay gives the host system the capabil-
ity of influencing all five core mechanisms 
directly. To arrange this, communication 
takes place through an interface – the con-
troller host interface (CHI) – between the 
network node and host.

Concentrating on the main interfaces, 
the task areas can be arranged as a proto-
col stack (Fig. 5). At the top level is the ap-
plication, which forwards its commands to 
the CHI. Under the CHI is the POC, which 
in turn has access to the MAC, clock syn-
chronization and frame & symbol process-
ing. In the next lower layer are the pro-
cesses for coding and decoding. The low-
ermost level is represented by the transfer 
characteristics of the physical layer.

The bottom three layers are in nodes 

that are connected to both channels: 
 double presence because these functions 
have to be fulfilled for each channel sepa-
rately. More precisely speaking, this 
means that for one node connected to  
both FlexRay channels there is double 
availability of synchronization, MAC, 
frame & symbol processing, coding  
and decoding, and physical layer.

Coding on the physical layer
For coding, FlexRay uses a NRZ method 
(Non-Return to Zero) in which the two 
identical transmission states are not di-
vided by a range in which the voltage falls 
back to a zero value. This type of coding 
makes it necessary to have mechanisms 
with which a network node can divide the 
transmitted states. To this end, FlexRay 
adds a sequence behind each transmitted 
byte: the byte start sequence (BSS). From 
this sequence, each node can detect when 
a byte has been transmitted and, with this 
information, encode the individual bits  
of the transmission.

By applying different voltages to the  
two wires of one channel, it is possible  
to create four bus states, which are desig-
nated Idle_LP, Idle, Data_0 and Data_1  
(Fig. 6).

A bus state is identified by measuring 
the differential voltage. Here, the bus volt-
age (uBus) is made equal to the difference 
between uBM and uBP (voltages at BP and 
BM).

With this method, the data transfer is pro-
tected against external electromagnetic 
 interference because these act equally on 
both wires and are canceled out in the dif-
ference.

Idle_LP (LP = low power) is the state in 
which a very low voltage of -200 mV and 
200 mV is present at BP and BM. This state, 
for example, is used to identify the start of 
a transmission.

In Idle state, a voltage of 2.5 V with a tol-
erance of 500 mV is present at BP and BM. 
To set the channel to Data_0 state, at 
least one transmitting node must apply  
a negative differential voltage of -600 mV 
to the channel.

For the channel to be set to Data_1 state, 
at least one transmitting node must apply 
a positive differential voltage of 600 mV  
to the channel.

If the transmission of an information 
signal is neither blocked by the bus guard-
ian nor the communication controller, a 
HIGH bit is signaled by the Data_1 channel 
state and a LOW bit by Data_0.

Generation of a frame bit stream
Before a node can transmit a frame con-
taining the data of the host, the frame is 
converted into a bit stream. To this end, 
the frame is first decomposed into individ-
ual bytes. The start of a frame is populated 
with a transmission start sequence (TSS) 
followed by a frame start sequence (FSS) 
(Fig. 7). From the bytes of the frames, an 
extended byte sequence (EBS) is then gen-
erated whereby each frame byte is pre-
ceded with a byte start sequence (BSS).
The 24-bit checksum (CRC) for this  
bit sequence (TSS+FSS+EBS) is now calcu-
lated and appended to the bit sequence.  
To finish the bit stream, a frame end 
 sequence (FES) is appended.

If the frame belongs to the dynamic seg-

ment, a dynamic trailing sequence (DTS) 
can be additionally appended to prevent 
another node from beginning its transmis-
sion on the channel prematurely.

Communication cycle
Each FlexRay cycle (Fig. 8) contains a 
static segment that is transmitted as the 
first part of the cycle. The static segment 
contains a fixed number of transmission 
ranges, the “static slots”.

Optionally, there may be a dynamic seg-
ment in the FlexRay cycle and this is trans-
ferred in second place. Each dynamic seg-
ment contains a fixed, freely configurable 
number of “minislots”.

Also optional is the symbol window, 
which is transmitted as the third element 
of the cycle. It can be used for the trans-
mission of an individual symbol and has 
the same size as a static slot.

To terminate the cycle, there is a phase – 
network idle time (NIT) – in which the bus 
is set to idle state. In general, the length  
of the NIT corresponds to the remaining 
macroticks not used by the static and dy-
namic segment or symbol window. This is 
not the case if it was detected during syn-
chronization that an offset correction is 
 required through which the length of the 
NIT can be increased or reduced.

Bus systems  |  FlexRay     131

Static segment
The static segment comprises a fixed num-
ber of equally sized transmission windows 
(static slots), which are sent simultane-
ously on both channels. Exactly one frame 
can be sent in each static slot. Both the size 
and quantity of the static slots in a static 
segment are configured during integra-
tion.

Bus access in the static segment is 
 controlled by a TDMA method whereby,  
in each slot, the frame with the corre-
sponding frame ID is sent. Frame ID 1  
is therefore sent in slot 1, frame ID 2 in  
slot 2 and thus frame ID n in slot n.

Dynamic segment
Unlike in the static segment, the transmis-
sions in the dynamic segment are not of 
fixed length. To control bus access, “mini-
slots” are used that hold the same fixed 
number of macroticks for all nodes con-
nected to the network. Macroticks are 
ranges in which exactly one frame can  
be transmitted.

“Dynamic slots” (transmission windows 
of variable size) are now created based on 
the minislots. The maximum size of a dy-
namic slot is limited by a fixed number of 
minislots specified during configuration.

To identify the end of a transmission,  
a phase in which the channel is idle (dy-
namic slot idle phase) is added to the end 
of a dynamic slot. The phase in which the 
transmission takes place is called the dy-
namic slot transmission phase.

Another difference between the dy-
namic and static segment is that the coun-
ters of slots transferred are incremented 
synchronously on both channels in the 
 dynamic segment. In the dynamic seg-
ment, the counter of both channels is in-
cremented independently in line with  
the current transmission status (Fig. 9).

Symbol window
The symbol window makes it possible to 
send a collision avoidance symbol (CAS)  
or a media access test symbol (MTS).  
These two symbols are identical and  
help to prevent collisions during the 
 system-startup phase.

The third symbol defined in the FlexRay 

protocol – the wakeup symbol (WUS) – is 
not permitted to be sent in the symbol win-
dow. It serves only to generate a wakeup 
pattern (WUP), which is used during the 
system startup.

Network idle time (NIT)
During the NIT, a network node corrects 
the ascertained time deviations of its inter-
nal clock. It also gives the network node 
the opportunity in this phase to make im-
plementation-dependent adjustments and 
changes to settings relating to the commu-
nication cycle.

Clock control
In both the static and the dynamic part of 
the communication cycle, FlexRay reverts 
to the identifiers of the transmission win-
dow in which a node may transmit. If this 
method is to be successful, it is necessary 
for all nodes connected to the network  
to have synchronous time information.

For this purpose, selected messages from 
the static part of the cycle are used (sync 
frames) and are transmitted by the net-
work nodes that are connected to both 
channels. 

In a distributed communication system, 

each network node generally needs its 
own internal clock for setting transmission 
timing correctly. As a consequence of tem-
perature and voltage fluctuations and pro-
duction-related precision tolerances, these 
internal clocks can soon deviate from an 
abstract, system-wide global time. In the 
case of a system such as FlexRay, which 
controls bus access by means of time slots, 
the synchronization of all network nodes 
plays an especially important role because, 
without a standardized, global time preset 
for all nodes, the specified transmission 
windows cannot be maintained and may 
break down.

Clock control hierarchy
In a FlexRay system, clocking is controlled 
on three levels (Fig. 10). The bottom level 
is represented by the microticks, which 
are derived directly from the oscillator 
clock of the network node. A microtick  
is therefore not a system-wide variable, 
but only relevant to the node concerned.
At the next level up, the clock is con-
trolled by means of macroticks – ranges  
in which exactly one frame can be sent. 
Within fixed tolerances, macroticks form 
the lowermost system-wide time unit.  
Each network node determines the dura-
tion of a macrotick in microticks. The 
number of microticks per macrotick does 
not have to be the same for all macroticks.
The top level is characterized by a clock 
control based on the communication cycle, 
which always contains the same, fixed 
number of macroticks.

Time synchronization
A synchronization method is required in 
order to guarantee a standardized time 
across the entire system. The basic para-
meters for timing are the number of 
 microticks per communication cycle  
(pMicroPerCycle), the duration of a com-
munication cycle (gdCycle) and the dura-
tion of a microtick (pdMicrotick), where 
the relationship between each is deter-
mined by the following equation:

pMicroPerCycle = round(  

gdCycle

_____________ 
  )
 
pdMicrotick

During operation of a FlexRay network, 
the clocks of the oscillators of various net-
work nodes will not be equal or even sim-
ply remain constant. They will fluctuate  
in response to outside influences. This 
 deviation is balanced by two corrective 
measures: the gradient correction and the 
inclusion of an offset in the communica-
tion cycle.

Fault-tolerant average algorithm
Since an individual node can only observe 
the differences between the expected time 
at which a transmission should have been 
actioned and the actual time at which the 
transmission took place, a fault-tolerant 
average algorithm (FTM), as described by 
J. L. Welch and N. A. Lynch, is used in both 
corrective measures. The measured time 
differences of all transmitted sync frames 
are sorted by their value. If more than 
seven sync frames were received, the two 
highest and two lowest values are removed 
from the list. If between three and seven 
sync frames were received, the highest and 
the lowest value are removed. For fewer 
than three sync frames, the average is 
 derived from all measured differences.

Gradient correction
With gradient correction, deviations in  
the transmission frequency of a node are 
continuously corrected during the com-
munication cycle. The node here checks 
the transmission frequencies of all other 
nodes. By means of the FTAA, these  
values are used to adjust the node's  
own transmission frequency.

Offset correction
Offset correction is a way to correct devia-
tions in the communication-cycle phase  
by including an offset in the NIT. With this 
method, the node similarly employs the 
FTAA to determine its phase difference  
in relation to the other nodes of the net-
work and uses it to determine the offset 
required to shorten or extend the NIT 
phase. Since all nodes use this approach, 
all nodes can initiate the transmission of  
a cycle in a synchronous manner.

Timing
Transmissions in the FlexRay system  
are timed by action points, which are 
 specially-marked macrotick boundaries.  
A transmission in a static slot begins once 
a static-slot action point has been reached. 
The position of this action point in a mac-
rotick is defined system-wide.

In a dynamic slot, a transmission begins 

once a minislot action point has been 
reached and ends at a subsequent minislot 
action point. This method ensures that 
there is always an idle period between 
 individual transmissions.

Frame format
FlexRay uses the same format in both  
the static and dynamic part of the frame. 
The format can be broken down into three 
parts: header, payload segment and trailer 
segment (Fig. 11).

The startup frame indicator reveals that 
this frame is a startup frame. Startup 
frames are used in the network's starting 
phase and may only be sent by special 
coldstart nodes.

The indicators are followed by the  

frame ID, payload length, header CRC and 
cycle count.

The frame ID has a length of 11 bits and 

corresponds to the number of the slot in 
which the frame is sent. In one cycle, each 
frame ID exists only once on each channel.
The payload length expresses the size  
of the information sent in the payload seg-
ment. Since the payload in a FlexRay frame 
is always sent in 2-byte words, a 62 in the 
payload length field indicates, for exam-
ple, that 124 bytes of payload are being 
transmitted in the payload segment.

In the static segment, the payload length 

field always contains the same value 
 because the size of information here is 
constant for all frames. Of course, this 
property does not apply to frames in the 
dynamic segment.

In the header CRC, an 11-bit CRC value 

is transmitted. This is formed from the 
polynomial

x11 + x9 + x8 + x7 + x2 +1.

Since the information in the header seg-
ment is constant for all frames in the static 
segment, the header CRC value can be cal-
culated offline and assigned to the network 
node through configuration settings.

If a frame in the dynamic segment is 
 always of the same size, it is possible here 
also for the CRC value to be calculated off-
line.

The final field in the header segment  
is the cycle count. This field contains the 
count number of the cycle in which the 
sending network node is currently active.

Header segment
The header segment contains a total of  
five bytes, at the start of which is a series 
of indicators.

The reserved bit is intended for future 
modifications to the protocol and is sent as 
a logical “0”.

The payload preamble indicator indi-
cates whether or not the payload segment 
contains a network-management vector 
(NMVector). An NMVector enables the host 
processor to transmit data directly without 
first being processed and prepared by the 
CC.

The null frame indicator indicates a null 
frame that contains no usable information.
The sync frame indicator indicates that 

this frame is intended to be used for sys-
tem synchronization. This indicator may 
only be set by network nodes that operate 
as sync nodes.

Payload segment
The payload segment has a maximum 
length of 254 bytes, which are transmitted 
in 2-byte words.

The payload segment customarily trans-
fers the payload that is further processed 
by the host processors. Optionally, how-
ever, an NMVector may also be sent in the 
payload segment, or a 16-bit message ID. 
With the assignment of message IDs,  
it is possible to send several data blocks in 
a frame. For this purpose, the message ID 
is placed at the front of the other data by 
the host processor as application data.

Trailer segment
The trailer segment contains a single  
field in which a 24-bit CRC checksum 
(frame CRC) is sent. The polynomial used 
to determine the frame CRC is:

x24 + x22 + x19 + x18 + x16 + x15 + x14 +
x13 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x6 + x3 + x+1

Standardization
FlexRay Group
FlexRay is a protocol specified by the 
FlexRay Group. The FlexRay Group was 
founded in 2000 by the companies, BMW, 
DaimlerChrysler, Motorola and Philips 
Semiconductors (www.flexray-group.com).
The members of the FlexRay Group are 

organized in a hierarchy. They also have 
different levels of influence on the further 

development of FlexRay, depending on  
the obligations that they have accepted. 
The uppermost group is represented by 
the core partners, which first and foremost 
include the founding members. Alongside 
the core partners are the premium associ-
ates and associate memberships.

By 2004 General Motors, Bosch and 

Volkswagen had joined the FlexRay Group 
as core partners. In 2004 Freescale took 
over Motorola's position in the group of 
core partners.

ple, individual actuators can be targeted 
for activation to check them for correct 
operation. At the end of the line (EOL),  
the diagnosis interface is used to test the 
electronic control unit and make changes 
to configurations (e.g. immobilizer, trans-
mission type). It is even possible to pro-
gram the entire flash EPROM using end- 
of-line programming.

Diagnostics requires an interface for con-
necting the tester to the electronic control 
units. For communication, there are basi-
cally two options available at the present 
time:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  K line and
  CAN bus

(cid:129)(cid:129)

The K-line network is not a bus in the true 
sense, which means that collisions may 
 occur. Since most electronic control units 
have a CAN interface for the exchange of 
data between electronic systems, this op-
tion for communication with the tester is 
gaining ever more in importance. 

Various protocols are implemented on 
the interfaces. These tend to be the CARB 
or official protocol and the manufacturer-
specific communication, which can be 
closely related in their properties and 
functions. It is even possible to use both 
interfaces: CARB-relevant functions run on 
the CAN, manufacturer-specific functions 
on the K line.

Figure 2 provides an overview of the 
standards and the various layers of the  
OSI reference model.

Diagnosis interfaces

Diagnosis legislation (e.g. CARB, California 
Air Resources Board) demands constant 
monitoring of emission-related compo-
nents in various electronic systems (OBD, 
On-Board Diagnosis). Faults (e.g. electrical 
short-circuits of sensors, implausible op-
erating states) are stored in a fault memory 
in the control unit. These faults can be 
read using a scan tool (official testing sta-
tion) or workshop tester. For this purpose, 
there is a socket in the footwell, dashboard 
or center console of the vehicle to which 
the tester is connected by means of a stan-
dard connector (ISO 15031-3) (Fig. 1).

Using a workshop tester, the after-sales 

service is able to read the entire fault 
memory: emission-related faults and 
 vehicle-specific faults (e.g. from Motronic, 
ABS). With the information stored in the 
fault memory, it is possible to diagnose a 
fault and repair it efficiently. The tester 
can also be used to clear the fault memory. 
Furthermore, measured values and con-
trol-unit identification values can be evalu-
ated. Using the workshop tester, it is also 
possible to control special diagnostic func-
tions. With actuator diagnosis, for exam-

Diagnostic protocol
The communication method in diagnostics 
is characterized by the fact that the tester 
(client) addresses one or several electronic 
control units (servers) and requests data 
output (e.g. from the fault memory) or an 
action (e.g. actuator diagnosis). These ser-
vices and the transmission agent are de-
fined in the various protocols.

KWP 71
This protocol was developed in collabora-
tion with Bosch as the first standardized 
serial interface and is based on a 5-baud 
initialization and byte handshake. For ad-
dressing, the protocol provides for the use 
of a unidirectional line (L line). The line  
for data exchange (K line) is bidirectional. 
 Alternatively, if the L line is not used at  
all in the system architecture, the K line 
can also be used for addressing because 
addressing and data exchange are two 
chronologically sequential states. The way 
in which communication is established is 
predefined, the services are standardized.

KWP 2000 (ISO 14230: 1-3)
This diagnostic protocol connects a tester 
to the electronic control units using a  
K line. In the KWP 2000 standard, there 
are various possibilities for the way in 
which communication is established (fast 
initialization and 5-baud initialization). 
The communication services are specified 
but there is some freedom for customer-
specific adaptations.

ISO 15765: 1-3 (CAN)
This standard reproduces the existing 
 protocols, ISO 14230: 1-4, on the CAN.  
It defines a way to leave untouched the 
fundamental format of messages ex-
changed between tester and electronic 
control unit and to transmit them on the 
CAN bus. 

CARB 
The Californian environmental authority 
(CARB) introduced guidelines to promote 
support for a standardized interface.  
The CARB protocol is built on existing 
standards and specifies the data flow and 
timing (transport layer). This is established 
in ISO 14230-4/ISO 9141-2 for the K line 
and in ISO 15765-4 for the CAN. The actual 
communication messages (services) in the 
application layer are precisely defined in 
ISO 15031-5/SAE J1979 and permit no 
manufacturer-specific deviations.

In California, every newly registered vehi-
cle must support at least one of these pro-
tocols with all emission-related electronic 
control units. The European counterpart  
is the EOBD standard.

Application protocols
The increasing complexity of control-unit 
functions places high demands on the 
 tuning and optimization of these systems 
to suit the types of engine and vehicle con-
cerned. This process is known as applica-
tion engineering. For this purpose, an 
 application system is connected to the 
electronic control unit. The application 
protocol for the K line is the McMess pro-
tocol, and the CCP protocol for the CAN.

McMess
With the McMess protocol, parameters in the 
electronic control unit can be modified and 
operands recorded. In a special application 
mode, the protocol describes the method 
and contents of communication between ap-
plication system and electronic control unit 
for the K line. With McMess, for example, the 
measuring device is able to read the contents 
of the variable memory (e.g. sensor values, 
measured values) quickly.

CCP (CAN Calibration Protocol)
The CCP protocol describes the contents 
of communication between an application 
system and an electronic control unit if 
these communicate on the CAN bus.  
CCP allows electronic control units in 
the network to function at higher payload 
rates than on the K line.

Communication on the K line
Physical layout 
The diagnostic tester connects to one or 
several electronic control units using the 
K-line system (Fig. 3). All electronic con-
trol units have equal rights. Communica-
tion flows bidirectionally between the tes-
ter and the electronic control units. This 
means that data can be received and sent 
by all subscribers. However, only one sub-
scriber is ever able to send at a given time.
The communication is an asynchronous 
process. There is no additional line for the 
transmission of a clock signal. The baud 
rate on the K line is between 1,200 and 
10,400 baud in accordance with ISO stan-
dards. In special applications (e.g. manu-
facturer-specific flash programming),  
it could even be as high as 250 kBd. 

Data transfer on the K line is realized as 
follows: the resistor in the tester increases 
the potential of the line – provided no elec-
tronic control unit is sending on it – to bat-
tery-voltage level (Fig. 4). If an electronic 
control unit is activated, it connects its  
K-line connection to the shared ground 
and therefore switches the potential of the 
K line to ground. Each of the connected 
electronic control units is able to detect 
that one of the bus subscribers is actively 
accessing the K line.

Message format
The message format of the KWP 2000 
 protocol comprises three parts (Fig. 5):
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Header
  Data bytes and
  Checksum

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

Checksum
The 1-byte checksum is always positioned 
at the end of a message. It contains the 
value of the modulo 256 sum across all 
bytes in the message – apart from the 
checksum itself.

Header
The header is made up of no more than 
four bytes.
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The format byte (Fmt) contains informa-
tion about the form and composition of 
the message. Two bits (A0 and A1) pro-
vide address information, while six bits 
(L0 to L5) provide the quantity of data 
bytes. With this coding, there can be up 
to 63 data bytes. If L0 to L5 are set to 
zero, the number of payload bytes must 
be coded using the length byte (Len).
  The target address (Tgt) indicates the 
communication partner for which the 
information is destined.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The source address (Src) indicates the 
communication partner that sent the 
 information.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The length byte (Len) specifies the quan-
tity of payload bytes (max. 255 bytes). 
Up to a value of 63, the coding can take 
place in Fmt. For more than 63, the 
length must be specified using this byte.

The existence of a target and source ad-
dress as well as the length byte is depen-
dent on the parameters from the format 
byte.

Data bytes
Up to 255 bytes of payload can be sent per 
message. The first byte of the payload is 
 always a service-identification byte (SId). 
The subsequent data bytes are data that 
differ depending on the service con-
cerned.

Initialization
To be able to send messages, each elec-
tronic control unit must support a subset 
of the possible message formats. At the 
 beginning of communication, the format 
supported by the electronic control unit  
is communicated to the tester by means  
of key bytes as part of initialization.

The ISO standards specify which of the 
possible initialization procedures are cus-
tomary for ECU diagnostics. The following 
initialization procedures are supported:

initialization and functional initialization, 
which introduces the topic of “point-to-
point” or “point-to-multi” communication. 
With functional initialization, a group of 
electronic control units is addressed and 
initialized. A function initialization can 
only be successful if all the electronic con-
trol units of this group support the same 
baud rate, the same transmission timing 
and the same protocol. By contrast, only 
one electronic control unit is initialized in 
the case of physical initialization.

5-baud initialization
Communication is initiated by means of  
a 5-baud address sent by the tester. It is 
thus possible for each electronic control 
unit to be addressed individually and ad-
dressing is clearly separate from the data 
transfer.

The tester outputs the address onto the 
K line at a transfer rate of 5 baud (Fig. 6). 
10 bits (eight data bits, one start and one 
stop bit) take approx. 2 seconds. 

On receiving the address, the electronic 

control unit responds with the baud-rate 

recognition pattern. From the bit sequence 
01010101 (binary format), the tester de-
termines the baud rate of the electronic 
control unit, which may be between 1,200 
and 10,400 baud. The electronic control 
unit then transmits the two key bytes, 
which communicate the header format  
and timing method that the electronic 
 control unit supports. As acknowledgment 
that communication has been successfully 
established, the tester sends the comple-
ment of the second key byte back to the 
electronic control unit and, in return, re-
ceives from the electronic control unit the 
complement of the address. Initialization 
is then complete and the regular data 
transfer may begin.

Fast initialization
Fast initialization establishes communica-
tion in a shorter time than 5-baud initial-
ization. With fast initialization, the tester 
sends a wakeup pattern (WuP) comprising 
a low and high phase, each lasting 25 ms 
(Fig. 7). At the end of the WuP, the tester 
sends the StartCommunication Service at a 
rate of 10,400 baud. The electronic control 
unit returns a positive reply containing the 
key bytes. Initialization is then complete 
and regular communication may begin.

CARB initialization
CARB initialization is a special case of  
5-baud initialization, although CARB may 
also be activated by fast initialization.  
A functional initialization of all connected 
electronic control units is achieved with 
the fixed address 0x33. The baud rate is 
permanently set at 10,400 Bd. The require-
ments are described in more detail in 
ISO 14230-4 and ISO 9141-2. 

One of the outcomes of these standards 
is that all emission-related electronic con-
trol units fitted in a vehicle may only sup-
port one protocol: ISO 14230-4, ISO 9141-2 
or SAE J1850. A mixture of protocols in the 
same vehicle is not permitted.

Key bytes
The electronic control unit uses key bytes 
to inform the tester of which header bytes, 
length bytes and timing method are sup-
ported. The key-byte decoding process  
is defined in ISO 9141 and ISO 14230-2.

Arbitration
Arbitration is a means of preventing or de-
tecting collisions of data sent by different 
electronic control units at the same time. 
Arbitration is necessary if a correct response 
to the tester request is to be received in 
the case of functional communication  
(e.g. reading the fault memory of all emis-
sion-related electronic control units using 
a scan tool). Collisions can be expected 
 because more than one electronic control 
unit is permitted to send following initial-
ization by the tester.

Arbitration is only relevant to data 

transfer on the K line.

Collision prevention
To prevent collisions following a tester re-
quest, each electronic control unit checks 
the K line for a falling edge after a time of 
P2min. A falling edge may be interference, 
or another electronic control unit has 
 already been sending data.

If a falling edge was detected, the elec-
tronic control unit delays sending its  
own data until the bus has returned to  
idle state and the P2min time period has 
again elapsed. Only then may it attempt  
to send its data again.

Collision detection
A collision cannot be prevented if two 
electronic control units send at the same 
time. In this event, the collision still has  
to be detected. This is possible by monitor-
ing the K line. To this end, the electronic 
control units reread their own transmitted 
byte through the serial interface.

In Figure 8, two electronic control units 

(ECU 1 and ECU 2) send a start bit at the 
same time. ECU 2 then sends a 0 (dominant 
bit) and ECU 1 a 1 (recessive bit). The 0 
 appears on the K line. With bit 2, the exact 
opposite is true. Here, ECU 1 persists with 
the dominant level. When the complete 
byte has been transferred, the electronic 
control units compare the byte sent on the 
K line with the byte they have read. In the 
example, a recessive level was overwritten 
by a dominant level for both electronic 
control units. From this, both electronic 
control units deem the transfer to have 
been faulty and retreat from sending.

To prevent cyclical collisions, the elec-
tronic control unit reports after a time of 
P2min, which is calculated in accordance 
with a specific algorithm.

Let us assume that ECU 2 in the previous 
example sent a 1 as its first data bit. ECU 1 
would then receive nothing from the data 
transfer of ECU 2 and would continue to 
establish communication. ECU 2, however, 
detects the collision in bit 2 and retreats. 
The collision in this event is non-destruc-
tive.

Communication on the CAN
Physical layout
A CAN interface containing the necessary 
hardware already exists in many electronic 
control units. This bus system can also be 
used for diagnostics. It is possible to com-
municate with the electronic control units 
using a diagnostic tester connected to the 
bus by a diagnosis connector.

Different addressing methods exist: 
 normal and extended addressing, whereby 
normal addressing is the regular address-
ing method and is analyzed below. Longer 
messages that do not fit into a CAN frame 
(seven bytes with normal addressing, six 
with extended addressing) are segmented 
into several CAN frames and recomposed 
by the recipient.

Unsegmented messages
If the quantity of data bytes to be transmit-
ted is no greater than seven bytes (for nor-
mal addressing), a single frame is trans-
ferred. The first byte to be sent is the PCI 
(Protocol Control Information). It identi-
fies the frame in the high nibble (top four 
bits of a byte) as being a single frame and 
indicates the data length (DL) in the low 
nibble (Fig. 9).

The data is sent by the transmitter to the 

receiver in a single message (Fig. 10a).

Baud rates
The typical baud rates associated with 
CAN are 500 kBd or 1 MBd.

Addressing and message types
Tester communication on the CAN bus  
is defined by ISO 15765. The communica-
tion services of ISO 15765-3 or 14 229-1 
are defined in a similar way to those of 
ISO 14230-3 (Fig. 2). 

The fundamental difference between 
these protocols is in the format of mes-
sages and how they are transmitted. While 
up to 255 data bytes can be transmitted in 
a message on the K line, only eight data 
bytes are possible with the CAN. To repro-
duce the service messages on the CAN, the 
contents (data bytes) of the header and the 
checksum are separated and embedded in 
a similar, new message format. The ad-
dress of the electronic control unit is now 
the CAN identifier itself. With different 
CAN identifiers, it is now possible to sup-
port functional or physical addressing.

Segmented messages
If more than seven data bytes (for normal 
addressing) are to be delivered, the diag-
nosis tester (client) sends a first frame  
on the CAN data bus (Fig. 10b) first of all. 
The electronic control unit (server) ac-
knowledges with a flow-control frame.  
The other data is subsequently sent in 
 consecutive frames.

The first frame contains the PCI, an ad-
ditional length byte (DL, Data Length) and 
the first six data bytes (Fig. 11). In the 
high nibble, the PCI contains the informa-
tion for identifying the frames as the first 
frame. The extended data length (XDL) 
is stored in the low nibble. Together with 
the DL, a 12-bit data word is formed with 
which it is possible to express values from 
0 to 4,095. 

The transmitter sends the first frame 
and waits for an acknowledgment of re-
ceipt from the receiver in the form of a 
flow-control frame. This message again 
contains the PCI, the high nibble of which 
identifies the frame as the flow-control 
frame. The low nibble contains the flow 
status (FS), which can be used to authorize 
or delay the sending of further frames 
(consecutive frames).

BlockSize (BS) indicates how many consec-
utive frames can be received without the 
need for a further flow-control frame to  
be sent. The values expressed in STmin

(Separation Time) specifies the interval

The flow-control frame is followed by 
the consecutive frames. Again, the PCI  
in the high nibble contains the identifier, 
while the low nibble contains the sequence 
number (SN). With the first consecutive 
frame to be sent, the SN is set to 1. The SN 
is incremented with each subsequent con-
secutive frame; after 15, the SN restarts 
from 0. By evaluating the sequence num-
ber, the receiver is able to detect whether 
or not all the frames have arrived.

Automotive sensors

The term sensor has become common,  
as in the past 20 to 40 years measuring 
gages have also come into use in con-
sumer applications (e.g. motor vehicle 
and domestic appliance technology). 
Sensors – another term for measuring 
 detectors or measuring sensors – convert 
a physical or chemical (generally non-
electrical) variable F into an electrical 
variable E; this process often also takes 
place over further, non-electrical inter-
mediate stages. 

Basics and overview

Sensor, term/definition
The electrical sensor outputs are not only 
provided in the form of current and volt-
age, but are also available as current or 
voltage amplitudes, frequency, phases, 
pulse widths, and cycles or periods of an 
electrical oscillation, or as the electrical 
parameters, resistance, capacitance, and 
inductance. A sensor can be defined using 
the following equation:

Table 1 summarizes and compares the 
 various fields of application for sensors. 
Figure 1 provides an overview of the 
 abundance of electronic vehicle systems 
 already on the market. Undoubtedly,  
this number will increase immensely  
in the years to come.

These model parameters are generally 
stored in a programmable, nonvolatile 
memory component (PROM) in the digital 
processes for conditioning sensor signals, 
which have come to dominate. By contrast 
with the conventional analog compensa-
tion of influencing variables, it is not only 
roughly linearly acting influences that may 
be corrected, but also strongly nonlinear 
processes that can be corrected success-
fully. Another significant advantage of this 
type of calibration, which takes place over 
a purely electrical connection, is that each 
sensor may easily be maintained under 
 operating conditions during the calibra-
tion phase.

▶ Concept of the smart sensor

 
In a somewhat more general form, 
 intelligent sensors (smart sensors)  
may be defined as follows:
Intelligent sensors, sometimes also 
known as integrated sensors or sensors 
with specific local electronics, allow the 
(static or dynamic) accuracy inherent  
in a sensor to be exploited by means of 
(generally digital) microelectronics to  
a far greater degree than conventional 
sensors. The sensor information, in par-
ticularly the complex information from 
multisensor structures, can be com-
pressed here by local further processing, 
that is to say, it is brought to a higher 
level (than the sensor alone is capable  
of providing), without a multiplicity of 
external connections being required  
for this.

146     Automotive sensors  |  Basics and overview

There is no clear determination as to 
whether sensors can already incorporate  
a part of the signal processing or not; it is, 
however, recommended, for example, that 
no distinction be made between elemen-
tary sensor, sensor cell, or the like and  
an integrated sensor.

Calibration process 
A smart sensor is generally programmed 
or calibrated, in a procedure correspond-
ing to the calibration of conventional ana-
log sensors, in three steps with the help of 
an external computer (host) (Fig. 4):

Recording the actual value 
The host computer systematically varies 
both the measured variable xe and the 
 influencing variable(s) y, thus setting a 
specific number of relevant and represen-
tative operating points. The smart sensor 
here passes the, still uncorrected, raw sig-
nals xa* to it. The host, however, is simulta-
neously also receiving the “true” values xe 
and y from substantially more accurate 
reference sensors. The host computes the 
correction values necessary by comparing 
these two values, and interpolates these 
corrections over the full measuring range.

Saving the correction parameters 
The host computer calculates the model 
parameters for the specific sensor from 
the data previously obtained, e.g. for a lin-
ear characteristic curve course and saves 
these to the smart sensor’s PROM. In a 
check process, these parameters may also 
first be emulated in the host computer’s 
RAM before they are finally burnt to the 
nonvolatile memory of the smart sensor.  
If characteristic curves are approximated 
with higher order polynomials, program 
maps (look-up tables) may also be stored 
in the smart sensor to avoid protracted 
computing processes. The solution of sav-
ing a coarse-grid program map in conjunc-
tion with a simple linear interpolation 
 between the data points (example shown 
in Fig. 5) has also proved very useful.

Operating phase
The smart sensor is now disconnected 
from the host computer and is in a position 
itself to calculate the measured variable xe 
with very low error thanks to the stored 
model data. It is able to pass the value to a 
connected control unit in digital, bit-serial 
or even analog form (e.g. pulse-width 
modulated), for instance. The measured 
variable can also be distributed digitally  
to further control units via a bus interface.

This process can, unlike conventional laser 
calibration, in principle also be repeated if 
an erasable PROM is used. This is a partic-
ular advantage in the development phase 
of sensors.

Example: two-dimensional data point-
program map s (Tn, qm) of a smart sen-
sor for the measurement of a travel s: 

For a highly precise evaluation of the 
sensor, which operates using variable 
inductance, its natural characteristic 
curve and its temperature sensitivity 
are each approximated using 5th order 
polynomials. As a frequency-determin-
ing element of a very simple oscillator 
circuit, it outputs the period duration T 
as an uncorrected output signal. As a 
sensor model for the measuring travel s, 
an outline program map embracing only 
32 x 64 = 2,048 example-specific values 
sn,m is stored (in the PROM) along with 
a simple interpolation algorithm (in the 
ROM), instead of a total of 36 poly-
nomial coefficents and a protracted 
polynomial evaluation. Should a signal T 
occur between these data points Tn and 
Tn+1 in conjunction with a temperature q 
between data points qm and qm+1, 
the sensor interpolates in two dimen-
sions in accordance with the mapping 
between the benchmark figures stored 
“error-free” s1,...s4 and thus the mea-
sured value s(T, q) sought is determined 
as the result of interpolation.

Automotive applications

With increasing demands on all functions 
in the vehicle, the control and regulation 
functions that were previously imple-
mented by mechanical means have, in the 
last 40 years, successively been replaced 
by electronic devices (ECU, Electronic 
Control Unit). This has necessarily caused 
high demand for sensors and actuators 
with which these electronic control units 
can, on the one hand determine the rele-
vant states of the vehicle, and on the other 
hand, actually influence these states.  
Over this period, the vehicle industry has 
become one of the, previously unprece-
dented, drivers of the development of sen-
sors that could be manufactured in large 
numbers. 

Whereas at the outset they still were of 

electromechanical or macromechanical 
form of some sort, the trend beginning  
in the 80s was for miniaturization, with

semiconductor methods (batch process-
ing) for the manufacture of high use sen-
sors. For a while, sensors originating in 
 hybrid technology using thick-film tech-
niques also played a not insubstantial role. 
These are still used in isolated applications 
today, e.g. in the wafer-shaped Lambda 
 oxygen sensors and high temperature 
 sensors for the exhaust line. 

Where temperature and magnetic field 
sensors could initially still be designed in 
circuit-like structures and be produced in 
batches, this trend increased as it became 
possible also to micromachine silicon in 
many various ways in two or three dimen-
sions, and also to connect them, even in 
multiple layers, very soundly by very 
 efficient methods.

Where the technologies of the electronic 

semiconductor circuits were practically 
exclusively based on silicon as the base 
material, quite different materials and 
technologies played a not insignificant  
role in sensors. Thus, for instance, quartz 
can also be micromachined using anisotro-
pic etching techniques, and unlike silicon 
also has very advantageous piezoelectric 
properties. III-V semiconductors such as 

gallium arsenide (GaAs) have a substan-
tially greater operating temperature range 
than silicon, which can be very advanta-
geous, particularly at some points in the 
vehicle. Thin metallic layers are very  
well suited to the manufacture of precise 
strain-gage resistors, accurate tempera-
ture sensors and magnetic field-dependent 
resistors.

With silicon it is possible also to inte-
grate the electronics monolithically with 
the sensor. This technique has lost its im-
portance – with a few exceptions (e.g. Hall-
effect ICs) – because of the generally very 
different number and type of process steps 
and also because of the inflexibility associ-
ated with this. Hybrid integration technol-
ogies in the tightest of spaces as a rule lead 
to substantially more cost effective, but 
functionally equivalent solutions (Fig. 7).

While the development of sensors was ini-
tially concentrated almost exclusively on 
systems inside the detail in the drivetrain, 
the suspension and the body and driving 
safety, the direction of sensing of newer 
developments is increasingly named to the 
outside and to the area close to and further 
from the vehicle:

  Ultrasound sensors detect obstacles on 
parking and will even allow automatic 
parking in the foreseeable future, per-
haps in combination with other sensors.
  Near-range radar scans the area around 
the vehicle to detect objects that proba-
bly could cause a collision, to gain time 
and to prime safety systems before a 
 collision occurs (precrash sensors).
  Imaging sensors can not only detect 

traffic signs and send them to the driv-
er’s display, but also detect the edge  
of the carriageway, warn the driver of 
any hazardous deviation and, where 
 required, in the long term also permit 
automatic driving. In combination with 
infrared beams and a screen in the driv-
er’s field of vision, IR-sensitive imaging 
sensors could permit long distance 
 observation of the carriageway, even  
at night (night vision) or in foggy con-
ditions.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Long-range radar sensors observe the 
carriageway for 150 m in front of the 
 vehicle, even in poor visibility, to adapt 
the driving speed to vehicles ahead and, 
in the longer term, also to support auto-
matic driving.

As part of the vehicle’s peripheral equip-
ment, the sensors and actuators form the 
vehicle’s interface to its complex drive, 
braking, chassis, and bodywork functions, 
as well as to the vehicle guidance and navi-
gation functions and the (usually digital) 
ECUs which operate as the processing 
units (Fig. 8). An adapter circuit is gener-
ally used to convert the sensor’s signals 
into the standardized form (measuring 
chain, measured-data registration system) 
required by the control unit.

These customer-specific adapter circuits 
are tailor-made for specific sensors and 
are available in integrated design and in  
a wide variety of versions. They represent 
a quite substantial and very valuable addi-
tion to the sensors described here, without 
which their use would not be possible, and 
the measuring accuracy of which is, prop-
erly said, only defined in conjunction with 
these.

The vehicle can be regarded as a highly 

complex process, or control loop, which 
can be influenced by the sensor informa-
tion from other processing units (control 
units), as well as from the driver using his/
her controls. Display units keep the driver 
informed about the status and the process 
as a whole. 

150     Automotive sensors  |  Details of the sensor market

Micromechanical processes for the pro-
duction of sensors are continually being 
further developed in tandem with the 
semiconductor processes. These compa-
nies do not, however, have any specific 
know-how in the area of specification, 
testing and packaging appropriately  
for the vehicle.

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Special, generally medium-sized manu-

(cid:129)(cid:129)

facturers of sensors, who do not produce 
semiconductor circuits, but have gener-
ally chosen just a few sensor types as 
their product to supply the sensor mar-
ket overall or just preferred branches 
such as the vehicle market.

  Large vehicle suppliers and system man-
ufacturers (e.g. Bosch) or large subsid-
iaries of vehicle manufacturer who have 
specialized in the needs and support of 
their mother groups. Here too, since the 
introduction of electronics in the vehi-
cle, experience has been gained with the 
production of semiconductor and hybrid 
circuits in close collaboration with semi-
conductor manufacturers (process de-
velopment, licensing). Thanks to system 
knowledge, it has been possible to build 
up comprehensive know-how in the 
field of specification, testing and pack-
aging techniques appropriate for the 
 vehicle.

Details of the sensor market

The proportion of value added in the vehi-
cle by the electrical and electronics sys-
tems is currently around 26 %. Nowadays, 
practically every second sensor is fitted 
into a vehicle, with annual growth rates 
that are, in some cases, still in double 
 digits. Since the start of the 90s, microme-
chanical and microsystem-technical sen-
sors have taken a rapidly increasing share, 
which amounted to about a third in 2005. 
Unlike in the general sensor market, 
 Europe has a current market share of  
41 % of the vehicle sensors sector and 
Bosch is the world market leader; this has 
clearly surpassed America with a share  
of just 34 %. The total market for sensors 
for vehicle applications is expected  
to grow from US$ 8.88 billion in 2005 to 
around US$ 11.35 billion in 2010, that is  
by a total of 28 % (Fig. 9).

There are typically three groups of compa-
nies offering sensors for use in the vehicle:
  The semiconductor industry: sensors 
(cid:129)(cid:129)
from semiconductor manufacturing 
originated here with the application  
of a few process steps. They serve the 
entire sensor market including the auto-
motive industry and have an efficiently-
operating sales and distribution system.

Features of vehicle sensors 

While general sensors are being developed 
for as broad a user group as possible and 
in multilevel measuring ranges, often with-
out the manufacturer being aware of the 
application, vehicle sensors are generally 
specified and optimized for a special ap-
plication. They are a part of a system and 
are often not freely available in the trade. 
Their development generally takes longer 
than that of commercial sensors, not just 
because of the enhanced demands. It is 
more associated with the development  
of the system and generally lasts as long  
as this does, as the sensor specification 
can still change until system development 
is concluded.

The high thrust for innovation in systems 
for the automobile sector very often com-
pels the development of new sensor tech-
nologies or significant extensions of their 
specifications. Figure 10 shows the typical 
development phases that vehicle sensors 
pass through at the supplier’s works. 

The development process begins natu-
rally with the system idea originating with 
the vehicle manufacturer or the supplier. 
The initial task is to make a selection of the 
measured variables required, whether or 
not this is feasible. At this stage, the sen-
sors’ function is simulated as part of the 
systems engineers’ usual system simula-
tion and a first specification is drawn up.  
If it is possible to use a sensor technology 
that has already been introduced, the 
wishes in respect of the sensors are passed 
directly to product development or the 
producing area. If no technology is imme-
diately available, sensor and technology 
experts are gradually increasingly in-
cluded in research and advanced develop-
ment. Here, the first laboratory prototypes 
can be created using known technologies 
and often with the help of external part-
ners. These prototypes can then be passed 
to product development for initial tests. 

If no sensor principles are known for the 
requirements set, research will be started 
into new procedures and methods for the 
measurement of the variables required. 
This phase is one of fundamental research 
which ultimately also supplies new initial 
technology prototypes. This procedure 
can repeat itself recursively until a prom-
ising solution which can then be sent to 
product development is found. It is not 
unusual for this development loop to be 
repeated again in full or for a different 
measured variable to be selected.

Five distinct phases are generally identi-
fied in the development of a completely 
new sensor, just as with other electronic 
products (Table 2). While prototypes and 
A-samples mostly still come from advance 
development or research, B- and C-samples

Sensor classification

Sensors can be classified and grouped 
 according to very different points of view. 
They can be classified with regard to their 
use in the vehicle as follows:

Assignment and application
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Functional sensors (pressure, air-mass 
flow) mainly used for open and closed-
loop control assignments

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Sensors for safety (passenger protec-
tion: airbag, ESP) and security (theft-
 deterrence feature)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Sensors for vehicle monitoring  

(on-board diagnosis (OBD), fuel-con-
sumption and wear parameters) and  
for driver/passenger information

Characteristic curve type
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Continuous linear curves (Fig. 11a) are 
used mainly for control assignments 
covering a wide measuring range.  
Linear curves are also distinguished by 
uncomplicated testing and calibration.
  Continuous nonlinear curves (Fig. 11b) 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

are often used for the closed-loop  
control of a measured variable across  
a very restricted measuring range  
(e.g. exhaust-gas control to l = 1, vehicle 
spring-deflection level). When, for in-
stance, a constant permissible deviation 
relative to the measured value is de-
manded throughout the complete mea-
suring range (e.g. HFM air-mass  meter), 
curves which feature both pronounced 
non- linearity and a special shape  
(e.g. logarithmic) are at an  advantage.
  Such two-step curves (possibly even 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

 featuring hysteresis, Fig. 11d) are used 
for limit-value monitoring in such cases 
where remedial measures are easy to 
apply when the limits are reached.  
If remedial measures are more difficult, 
then multi-step curves (Fig. 11c) can be 
used for an earlier warning.

Type of output signal 
Sensors may also be distinguished by the 
type of output signals (Fig. 13):

For instance, the signal is bound to be 
discontinuous if it is digital and issued  
in bit-serial form.

  A further distinction must be made, as is 
represented in Figure 12 in a systematic 
overview of the determined, i.e. nonran-
dom (stochastic) signal – as to whether 
the signal is permanently available at  
the sensor output (continuously) or only 
at discrete intervals (discontinuously).

154     Automotive sensors  |  Error types and tolerance requirements

Error types and
tolerance requirements

The deviation of the actual characteristic 
curve of a sensor from its reference char-
acteristic curve is designated its error e. 
It is best stated in relation to the input 
range y (measured variable) and not to 
the output range x (output signal):
(3)  e = yindicated - ytrue

 

 yindicated = indicated value for the mea-
sured variable
 ytrue = ideal value, setpoint value for 
the measured variable (is determined 
with a measuring sensor that is more 
accurate than the sensor being exam-
ined by at least 1 class)

The amount of the deviation represents,  
as shown in Figure 14, the absolute 
 error eabs (unit as measured variable). 
 Related to the true measured value ytrue, 
this becomes the relative error (% of read-

value it becomes the percentage error of

Assuming a generally desirable linear 
characteristic, the absolute deviation eabs

The deviations referred to are exclusively 
systematic or terministic errors which, by 
contrast with random (stochastic) errors, 
are well defined, foreseeable and, as a mat-
ter of principle, correctable, and are also 
for the most part more or less precisely 
corrected.

The non-correctable, stochastic errors 

include, for example,
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Drift (low and higher frequency back-

ground noise) and
  The effects of aging

(cid:129)(cid:129)

In the specification of a sensor, the total 
error in the new state and after aging is 
prescribed in the product specifications  
by means of a tolerance graph (Fig. 16). 
Sometimes, however the permissible indi-
vidual error shares such as the offset,  
lead and linear deviations are additionally 
specified.

Strict metrology teaching states that,  
in the case of systematic errors, the sum  
of the amounts of the individual errors 
must be assumed as the total error (these 
may add up in the worst case). In the case 
of stochastic errors, statistical addition, 
which calculates the total error as the root 
of the sum of squares of the individual er-
rors, is permitted. As statistical addition 
leads to a smaller total error, it is, however, 
often also applied to the systematic errors 
in a less strict configuration:

Failure rate
The operational reliability of a sensor is  
a purely statistical quantity and, as with 
any component, is characterized by its 
failure rate l, which is stated in 1/h, %/h 
or ppm/h. Here l is determined with a 
large number of parts. If it is wished to 
 determine approximately the failure rate 
with a number N (< 40) of sensors that is 
not too great, it is possible to observe the 
failure behavior of this random sample 
 under operating conditions until, after a 
 finite time, all the parts have failed. If this 
observation is begun at time t0 and if the 
inventory of parts remaining at a later 
point ti is identified as B(ti), then a good 
approximation for the failure rate l is the 
failure quota q:
 
B(ti) – B(ti+1)
(6)  q(Dti, ti) =  ––––––––––––––––––        Failure quota
Dti · B(ti)
 
 

         where Dti = ti+1 - ti 

 

 

 

 

ti are the times at which individual parts 
or several parts fail (Fig. 17). The ratio of 
the current inventory of parts to the initial 
inventory of parts is known as the relative 
inventory BR:

With a very large number of parts (N → ∞), 
the survival probability R(t) at the, here 
now continuously variable, time t corre-
sponds to this. The failure rate is calcu-
lated here for a large number (in practice 
N ≈ 2,000) of sensors as a percentage varia-

Furthermore, it is absolutely necessary to 
specify under what operating conditions 
the failure rate defined in this way is to  
be understood. Particularly in the case  
of electrical components such as sensors, 
for example, it is necessary to distinguish 
between true, active operating time 
(switched on state) and service life in the 
sense of pure storage time. Any statement 
of a failure rate without this additional in-
formation is worthless.

Failure rates are normally determined 
using time-acceleration methods. The ac-
celeration factors are achieved here by ex-
posing the sensors to enhanced operating 
conditions. A high degree of experience is 
required in order to apply time accelera-
tion methods that truly reflect reality.

The concept of the mean service life TM is 
also used to characterize the reliability of  
a sensor. A good approximation of this can 
be calculated from a random sample from 
the sum of the individual service lives Ti:

chemical and electrical ambient influences 
must be provided (packaging, passivation). 
On the other hand, it is costly to create op-
erational reliability by testing alone, i.e. to 
exclude early failures through premature 
aging.

It is sensible to provide monitoring and 
diagnostic capabilities for sensors in com-
plex systems (e.g. signal range check, etc.), 
so that any failures occurring may be de-
tected in good time. In an emergency, a 
sensor’s function can here be temporarily 
replaced by other measured variables or 
sensible fixed values (limp-home mode, 
back up). A sensor-less, often purely me-
chanical, limp-home mode can be pro-
vided. For instance, should the accelera-
tor-pedal sensor failure in a diesel vehicle, 
the vehicle could also be driven slowly 
back for repair under regulated idle speed 
alone (limp home).

Where reliability must be guaranteed 
with a probability bordering on certainty 
(e.g. for sensors in electronic braking and 
steering systems), redundancy, i.e. provi-
sion of multiple parts, is generally the 
means used. Dual redundancy of a sensor 
of the same type here only permits failure 
detection for the case of widely different 
indications, whereas triple redundancy 
with 2 from 3 analysis additionally still 
supplies a correct measured value. Here, 
however, care must be taken to provide not 
only redundancy of the sensors, but other 
essential parts such as the power supply, 
signal evaluation and transmission means 
must also be correspondingly redundant, 
as otherwise the probability of simultane-
ous failure increases. It is often also advis-
able to provide sensor redundancy in dif-
ferent technologies.

The failure rate of a product against time 
shows a typical bathtub pattern (Fig. 18). 
At the start, the failure rate is somewhat 
high because of early failures, it then 
passes through a longer, relatively low, 
horizontal range, then to rise again drasti-
cally towards the end of the service life 
(aging and wear effects). In the case of sen-
sors for which high operational reliability 
is demanded, an attempt is made to avoid 
the elevated failure rate at the start by 
sorting out the early failures by pre-aging, 
e.g. by conditioning at higher tempera-
tures (“burn in”). Early failures are basi-
cally nothing other than manufacturing 
defects that have not been recognized.

Table 3 gives some examples of permis-

sible failure rates l applicable for the 
 vehicle. The ppm values given relate to  
a period of 10 years, or alternatively to 
150,000 km covered, if this is completed  
in a shorter time. Where the sensors are 
given a flat rate of <10 ppm, it means that 
in 10 years, only fewer than 10 of 1 million 
sensors may fail. This value is, however, 
substantially lower for sensors in passen-
ger protection systems.

Measures for increasing reliability
The best method for ensuring high quality 
is to engineer and design in reliability.  
This means that as soon as the sensor is 
designed, correspondingly durable mate-
rials must be selected and solid protective 
measures against anticipated mechanical,

Main requirements, trends 

The vehicle sensors customized for the re-
quirements of special electronic systems  
in the vehicle, unlike the universal sensors 
conventionally found in the market, are 
subject to five strict requirements (Fig. 19) 
which must be fulfilled by development 
and to which the most  important develop-
ment trends also correspond. 

Low manufacturing costs
Electronic systems in modern vehicles eas-
ily contain up to 150 sensors. Compared  
to other sectors of sensor application,  
this abundance forces a radical reduction 
in costs. The target costs – typically in the 
range of € 1 to 30 – are here often less than 
one-hundredth of those for conventional 
sensors of the same capacity. Naturally, 
particularly with the introduction of a new 
technique or technology, the costs are gen-
erally on a falling learning curve, starting 
from a higher level.

Development trends
Automated manufacturing processes 
(Fig. 20) are largely used, working to a high 
yield. This means that each process step  
is always executed for a large number of 

sensors simultaneously. For example, 
semiconductor sensors are manufactured  
using “batch processing” in which 100 to 
1,000 sensors are manufactured simulta-
neously on a single silicon wafer. On the 
other hand, such manufacturing equip-
ment is only an economic proposition 
when correspondingly large numbers of 
sensors are produced. These quantities 
sometimes exceed an automotive-industry 
supplier’s own in-house requirements,  
and can typically often be between 1 and 
10 million per year. Here, the high num-
bers of sensors needed by the automotive 
industry has played an unprecedented and 
revolutionary role, and set completely new 
standards.

High reliability
In accordance with their assignments, 
 vehicle sensors are subdivided into the 
 following reliability classes, given in 
 descending order of severity:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

Automotive sensors  |  Main requirements, trends     159

The requirements on the highest class  
here easily match the high reliability val-
ues familiar from aerospace applications. 
To some extent, they demand similar mea-
sures, such as the use of the best materials, 
redundant componentry, self-monitoring, 
(short-term) backup power supply, multi-
ple programming of critical decision-mak-
ing algorithms.

Development trends
Appropriate design measures guarantee 
built-in reliability. For instance, this neces-
sitates the use of reliable, top-quality com-
ponents and materials, coupled with rug-
ged and well-proven techniques and engi-
neering. And furthermore, an effort is 
made to achieve a consistent integration  
of the systems to avoid connection points 
which may be broken and are at risk of 
failure. This is possible, for instance,  
with radio-scanned sensors based on the 
antenna-coupled SAW (Surface Acoustic 
Wave) elements which do without wiring 
completely. If necessary, redundant sensor 
systems are fitted.

Severe operating conditions
Like practically no other breed, vehicle 
sensors are exposed to extreme stresses 
because of where they are fitted, and must 
withstand all kinds of aggression:
  Mechanical (vibration, shock)
(cid:129)(cid:129)
  Climatic (temperature, moisture)
  Chemical (e.g. spray, salt mist, fuel, 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

 engine oil, electrolyte)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Electromagnetic (incident radiation, 
line-conducted interference, excess 
voltages, polarity reversal)

It is this trend of using sensors immedi-
ately at the site where the measurement  
is taken in order to exploit the benefits 
 associated with this which itself leads  
to the requirements being considerably 
cranked up. 

Figure 21 illustrates this problem on  
a sensor which might be a temperature 
sensor, speed sensor, flow-rate sensor  
or concentration sensor, for instance.  
The sensor cannot in the slightest always 
be surrounded by a hermetic protective 
sleeve. Although this sleeve could offer 
rough protection for the measurement of 
temperature, flow rates and concentration, 
it must permit more or less  direct contact 
between the sensor and the generally very 
aggressive monitored medium (an excep-
tion to this is the inertia sensor). Some-
times, thin, but very resistant, passivation 
layers are permissible on the sensor. 

The form of the plug-in sensor demands 

a permanently tight seat of the mount in 
the associated wall (inner packaging, outer 
packaging). The sensor may be connected 
to the electronic control units via a fixed 
housing plug or also, as illustrated, via a 
plug flexibly fastened with a length of ca-
ble (e.g. ABS wheel-speed sensor). Here, 
too, there are three critical electrical con-
nection points that absolutely must be pro-
tected against conductive fluids and corro-
sion: the inner connection on the sensor 
element, the connection of the cable tail 
and finally the connection of the partially 
shielded cable to the external plug connec-

tion. If the seal is inadequate, it is only a 
question of time until corrosive liquids 
penetrate from the external connector  
into the internal sensor terminal.

The plug-in connection itself must be 
sufficiently tight overall, that no shunts 
form at the sensor output. The cable itself 
must retain its flexibility and tightness 
 after many years of operation under the 
most adverse conditions.

Separable plug-in connections in the 
 vehicle unfortunately still represent one  
of the most frequent causes of failure. 
Wireless signal connections (e.g. infrared 
light or radio) could break down this prob-
lem in the longer view, especially if the 
sensors were even to have a wireless 
 energy supply (autonomous sensors).

The costs of these indispensable tech-
nologies complementary to the sensors 
 often exceed those of the actual sensor 
 element many times over. They constitute 
the actual value of an vehicle sensor, not 
only in terms of cost, but also in terms of 
function.

Development trends
Protective measures against the stresses 
referred to demand a very high degree of 
specific know-how in the field of sensor 
packaging.

Furthermore, detailed knowledge of the 
loading to which the sensor will be sub-
jected at the particular installation point  
is required. It is often forgotten that the 
quality of a sensor stands and falls with 
 total competence with these protective 
measures.

Fiber-optic sensors in which the light 
guided in the optical fibers (glass, plastic) 
can be modified as a function of the mea-
sured variable are particularly immune to 
electromagnetic interference. This is true 
up to the point at which the optical signals 
are converted back into electrical signals. 
If these are to be used in the future, there 
will have to be some development work 
the provision of low-priced measuring 
 elements and the accompanying technolo-
gies. There are, for example, some very 
 interesting applications for this in the  
field of force measurement, e.g. in provid-
ing finger protection for electric power 
windows and sliding sunroofs (Fig. 22). 
 Sensors of this type have also been tested 
very successfully as very early responding, 
distributed sensors in the door and frontal 
area of the vehicle for triggering passenger 
and pedestrian protective systems.

force is applied or whether it is acting 
at a point or is distributed (distributed 
sensors).

Low-volume design
On the one side, the number of electronic 
systems in the vehicle continues to climb 
steadily. On the other, today’s vehicles are 
becoming more and more compact. These 
facts, together with the need to retain the 
high level of passenger-compartment com-
fort forces development to concentrate on 
an extreme space-saving designs. Further-
more, the increasing demand for further 
improvements in fuel economy mean that 
minimization of the vehicle’s weight is of 
prime importance.

Development trends
Widespread use is made of the familiar 
technologies applied in circuit engineering 
for the miniaturization of electronic com-
ponents:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Film and hybrid technologies (deforma-
tion-dependent resistors, thermistors, 
and magnetoresistors); nanotechology
  Semiconductor technology (Hall-effect 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

and temperature sensors)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Surface and bulk micromechanical tech-
niques (silicon pressure, acceleration 
and yaw-rate sensors)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Microsystem technology (combination 
of two and more microtechnologies  
such as microelectronics and micro-
mechanics, Fig. 23)

Micromechanical manufacturing refers  
on the one hand to dimensions in the µm-
range and tolerances in the sub-µ-range 
which cannot be achieved with conven-
tional machining methods. On the other 
hand, sensors which may have dimensions 
in the mm-range, but which are manufac-
tured with micromechanical methods, are 
also considered micromechanical (Fig. 24). 
We will discuss only the most well-known 
and important method here, anisotropic 
etching of silicon. This is the most impor-
tant method, because silicon is manufac-
tured to high precision and in large num-
bers at low cost, and is the most thor-
oughly researched and best known 
material. In addition, it offers the capabil-
ity of the monolithic integration of sensor 
and evaluation electronics. The etching 
speeds, which can be very different de-
pending on the crystal axis (1:100), with 
which suitable etching fluids such as  
KOH attack are exploited in this method  
(Fig. 25); some crystal faces, for instance, 
remain practically untouched, while other 
faces are  rapidly etched to some depth.

In conjunction with appropriate etching 

stop methods (doping, depletion layer) 
practically three-dimensional structures  
of the smallest dimensions may be pro-
duced to the highest precision in this way

25  Test structure for the determination of the  
etching rate in Si monocrystal wafers

(Figs. 26, 27). The problem of simultane-
ously integrating the circuit can be consid-
ered largely resolved, even if currently the 
associated circuit for most sensors is still 
made separately for reasons of a better 
yield and higher flexibility.

By contrast with bulk micromechanics, 
anisotropic, often wafer-depth etching has 
no role to play in surface micromechanics 
(SMM). SMM sensor structures are mostly 
built up additively on the surface of a sili-
con substrate (Figs. 28 and 29). Even if  
the dimensions of bulk silicon sensors  
are still mostly in the mm-range, those of 
SMM structures are an order of magnitude 
smaller (typically 100 µm), as a rule.

Frequently, mechanically indispensable 
parts are used simultaneously for enclos-
ing and even cooling (associated) sensors 
and electronics (e.g. microhybrid control 
unit as an add-on control unit to the VP44 
diesel distributor-type injection pump). 
This fusion of mechanical and electronic 
components known as mechatronics is 
coming more and more to the forefront  
in the search for cost and space savings.  
In the foreseeable future, practically all 
systems will operate on this basis.

Another example of a mechatronic sensor 
system is the Hall-effect speed sensor built 
into the wheel bearing. The addition of 
magnetic particles to the indispensable 
shaft seal in the bearing can even give it 
the function of the rotor or a pole wheel. 
The sensor benefits from excellent protec-
tion and encapsulation along with the high 
precision of the roller bearing and no lon-
ger needs any bias magnets. Finally, the 
Hall-effect technology allows installation 
in the very tight space within the bearing.

High accuracy
By comparison with the probes and sen-
sors used for instance in the processing 
 industry, with only a few exceptions (e.g. 
the air-mass meter), the accuracy demands 
made on vehicle sensors are relatively 
modest. Generally, the permissible devia-
tions are > 1 % of the measuring-range fi-
nal value. This applies in particular when 
considering the unavoidable effects of 
 aging. The permissible deviations are nor-
mally achieved by the application of com-
plex techniques to compensate for manu-
facturing tolerances, and to balance the 
 effective compensation measures used 
against interference. Particularly since  
the above-mentioned requirements have 
for the most part become achievable, con-
tinually more demanding and sophisti-
cated systems are imposing higher and 
higher demands in this sector.

Development trends
Initially, a tightening up of the tolerances 
in manufacture, and refinement of the cali-
bration and compensation techniques help 
in this regard. An important step forward 
here is the hybrid or monolithic integra-
tion of the sensor and signal electronics 
directly at the measuring point, even em-
bracing complex digital circuits such as 
analog/digital converters and microcom-
puters (Fig. 30). 

Such microsystems are also known as 
“intelligent sensors”. They take full advan-
tage of the sensor’s inherent accuracy,  
and offer the following features:

While simultaneously detecting and digi-

variable practically without error by ap-
plying the mathematical sensor model 
(Fig. 31). Here, the item-specific model 
 parameters are defined in a preceding 
process which is equivalent to the calibra-

in a PROM integrated within the sensor.  
In this manner, it is possible to consider-

Local electronic circuitry necessitates the 
use of multi-sensor structures which use a

of highly complex facts and locally reduce 
these to their basic information content,  
as necessary. This applies in particular to 
imaging sensors which in future will play 
an ever increasing role in detecting the 
 situation inside and outside the vehicle.

Automotive sensors  |  Overview of the physical  effects for sensors     165

With a number of pressure sensors inte-
grated into the smallest of spaces, it is pos-
sible to not only increase the reliability  
of measurement, but also to reduce the, 
generally irregular, aging drift by applying 
mean-value generation. Individual failures 
(outliers) can also be detected and elimi-
nated. Sensors of this type are also known 
as soft sensors. If the individual sensor 
 elements are designed for differing mea-
suring ranges – and at the same time fea-
ture high overload capabilities (e.g. capaci-
tive) – such a sensor can be used to con-
siderably extend the high-acccuracy 
measuring range. Sensor structures of this 
type were developed and tested years ago, 
but have not been converted into 
 marketable products.

Overview of the physical 
 effects for sensors

The sensors are not classified here into a 
systematic structure by measuring effect, 
but rather by measured variable. For this 
reason, the most important physical ef-
fects or measuring concepts exploitable 
for measuring purposes will here only be 
reproduced in the form of a rough over-
view, which cannot be complete. Overlaps 
between the various categories are un-
avoidable. The table specifies principally 
the actual electrical effects; mechanical or 
fluid prior stages, such as strain springs 
(force), membranes (pressure), spring-
mass systems (acceleration), vibration sys-
tems (tuning forks) or even fixed and rotat-
ing turbine blades (flow) are not included.

Sensor measuring principles

There is a great number of sensors at 
work in motor vehicles. They act as the 
sensory organs of the vehicle and convert 
input variables into electrical signals. 
These signals are used in control and 
regulation functions by the control units 
in the engine-management, safety and 
comfort and convenience systems. Vari-
ous measuring concepts are applied, 
 depending on the task.

Position sensors

Characteristics
Position sensors record the widest variety 
of one or multi-dimensional travel and an-
gular positions (translational and rotary 
variables) in a wide variety of areas. This 
 includes gaps, distances, displacements,  
fill levels and even minor expansions – 
 anything that can be measured in meters 
and angles. 

In this sector of applications, activities 
have long since been directed at changing 
over to proximity or non-contacting sen-
sor principles. Such sensors are wear-free 
and thus have a longer service life as well 
as being more reliable. The costs involved 
though often force vehicle manufacturers 
to retain contacting sensor principles 
which still perform sufficiently well for 
many measuring tasks.

Position variables are “extensive mea-
sured variables”, the measured variable  
or the measuring range of which has  
a substantial influence on the size of the 
sensor (by comparison, pressure and tem-
perature, for instance are “intensive mea-
sured variables”). Sensors for extensive 
variables of medium and larger ranges 
(e.g. including flow and force sensors) are 
thus initially less suited to miniaturization 
on the one hand and hence for cost-effec-
tive mass production. As this is much less 
true for angular-position sensors than for 
travel sensors (the angle value does not 
depend on the radius or leg length), the 
former are clearly preferred in the vehicle.
In the case of extensive variables with  

a large measuring range, however, the 
 extensive variable can often be first con-
verted into an intensive variable, which 
can then be measured using microsensors. 
Thus flow measurement can be converted 
to flow density measurement (partial flow 
measurement, e.g. 1:100) where the flow 
tube becomes an essential component part 
of the sensor without which the sensor ul-
timately cannot be tested and calibrated.

tion by a reference mark detectable by the 
sensor, in case a fault should have occurred. 
This also takes account of the fact that the 
position of the crankshaft when the engine 
is started is not known; it must first rotate 
almost one revolution under the starter so 
that the reference mark is passed at least 
once. The crankshaft’s motion is also very 
monotonous, i.e. it is always pretty much 
smooth (without sudden changes) and is 
 always in one direction (that is forwards, 
and never backwards). You can thus be  
sure that no more than one revolution will 
ever be incorrectly  detected.

The disadvantages of an incremental 
 angle measurement cannot be absorbed  
if the engine starts immediately without 
being cranked, as is also the case with the 
steering angle. An absolute angle sensor 
for a 360° range is required here.

Potentiometer sensors
The wiper potentiometer, usually made as 
an angular-position sensor (Fig. 1), uses 
the correspondence between the length of 
a wire or film resistor (Cermet or conduc-
tive plastic) and its resistance value for 
measuring purposes. At present, this is 
still the lowest-priced travel/angular-posi-
tion sensor. The shape of the characteristic 
curve can be influenced by shaping the 
measuring track (or just sections of it).  

1 Principle of the wiper potentiometer

In the case of travel and distance sensors 
covering large measuring ranges (approxi-
mately 0.1 to 150 m), the measured vari-
able is converted into a pulse or phase 
runtime by means of wave-propagation 
sensors (sound and electromagnetic 
waves), which can then be easily measured 
electronically with relatively small trans-
ceiver devices. In the case of sound waves, 
however, the propagation medium (e.g. air) 
and the time standard required (e.g. oscil-
lating crystal) then become an essential 
component part of the measuring device.

Measured variables: overview
There are a large number of applications 
in which position represents the actual 
measured variable. This is shown in over-
view by Table 1. In other cases, the mea-
sured position or angle represents a differ-
ent measured variable (Table 2).

In practice, “incremental sensor systems” 
are also often referred to as angular-position 
sensors, even when they are used for mea-
suring rotational speed. These sensors are in 
reality not angular-position sensors. Since 
the increments (steps with which a given 
variable increases) which have to be mea-
sured with these sensors in order to measure 
the deflection angle must be counted with 
the correct preceding sign (in other words, 
added), these sensors are in reality not angu-
lar-position sensors. Due to the danger of the 
counter being falsified as a consequence of 
spurious pulses, such angular-position mea-
suring systems are only in limited use. Fixed, 
directly locatable reference marks only pro-
vide very little help in this dilemma. Another 
disadvantage of such angular-position mea-
suring systems is the fact that the absolute 
position is lost when the operating voltage is 
switched off. It is no use storing the final po-
sition in a non-volatile memory here, since 
most angular positions can also change me-
chanically when power has been removed  
(e.g. steering angle).

Although it is true that the crankshaft 
 angle is measured incrementally, this mea-
surement is recalibrated after each revolu-

The standard wiper connection is fur-
nished by a second contact track consist-
ing of the same material mounted on a low-
resistance substrate. The supply voltage is 
usually applied to the measurement track 
through low-resistance series resistors RV 
(these can also be used for calibration of 
zero point and progression-rate adjust-
ment) to protect against overloading.

Wear and falsification of measured val-
ues can be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the electrical loading of the pick-off as low 
as possible (IA < 1 mA) and by dust-proof 
and waterproof encapsulation. One of the 
prerequisites for low wear is the optimal 
friction pairing between the wiper and the 
conductor track. To this end, wipers can 
be of “spoon” or “scraper-shape” design, 
and one or more can be mounted. Brush-
shaped wipers are also in use.

A whole range of clear advantages are 
faced by a considerable number of serious

Magnetically inductive-type sensors
Of all the sensors using proximity and  
non-contacting principles for position 
measurement, the magnetic sensors have 
proved to be the most rugged and most in-
sensitive to interference. This applies in 
particular to those principles relying on al-
ternating current, in other words magneti-
cally inductive principles. Compared with 
a micromechanical sensor though, the coil 
configuration needed here requires far 
more space. This means therefore that 
there is no favorable possibility of redun-
dant (parallel measurement) design. Fur-
thermore, coil contacting is less favorable 
from the costs and reliability viewpoint.

Although there are a multitude of differ-

ent principles in use for this form of sen-
sor, only two have come to the forefront 
for motor vehicle applications. Regarding 
their operating concepts, these are very 
similar to each other. However, they are 
currently no longer in use in their macro-
mechanical version by Bosch for motor 
 vehicle sensors in new developments.

an effect upon the coil’s equivalent resis-
tance and its inductance. This is the result 
of the eddy currents generated in the disk 
(otherwise known as a spoiler) due to the 
increasing magnetic coupling. The disk’s 
position represents the measured travel s.
The generally high operating frequency 

(MHz range, a low-frequency feed would 
take up too much current because of the 
low coil inductance) requires a direct as-
signment of the electronics to the sensor 
or a shielded supply lead, which is gener-
ally not supportable. In order to convert 
the measuring effect into an electrical out-
put voltage, either the damping effect 
(equivalent resistance) or field-displace-
ment (inductance) principles can be ap-
plied. In the first (damping effect) case,  
a variable-amplitude oscillator can be 
used, and in the second a variable-fre-
quency oscillator or a constant frequency 
supplied inductive voltage divider (differ-
ential configuration).

There are many ways to adapt the eddy-
current principle to the measuring assign-
ment. It is suited both to the determination 
of large travel distances or angles (there 
has already been a practically production-
ready development, for the throttle valve 
and accelerator pedal, for instance) and 
also for very small variables (e.g. torque 
sensors). Because of the self-compensating 
properties, this principle generally only 
shows a very small temperature sensitivity 
over a wide temperature range. As eddy-
current sensors can also, in principle, be 
manufactured micromechanically, their fu-
ture use cannot be completely written off 
given their very advantageous properties. 
This sensor principle is, however, widely 
used in manufacturing and quality mea-
suring technology, for the precise detec-
tion of the smallest displacements/dis-
tances or for the measurement of layer 
thicknesses in the µm range.

Short-circuiting ring sensors
In contrast to eddy-current sensors, the  
coil of a short-circuiting ring sensor has a 
straight or curved U or E-shaped soft mag-
netic, (usually) laminated iron core (Fig. 7). 
The coil, or short-circuiting ring (“spoiler”), 
is of highly conductive material (copper or 
aluminum), and is located around one (or 
all) of the core limbs. Because of their iron 
core, sensors of this type have a far greater 
inductance than eddy-current sensors and 
also a far higher measuring effect because 
of the guidance of the magnetic flux being 
very concentrated by the iron core. This 
means that they operate well at low fre-
quencies, and do not necessarily require 
their signal electronics locally, that is di-
rectly on the sensor itself. The iron core 
also protects the measuring space between 
the core limbs very well against external in-
terference fields.

The alternating field generated in and 
around the iron core by the coil current I 
cannot pass through the short-circuiting 
ring, since the eddy currents in the short-
circuiting ring reduce it practically to zero.

Thus the eddy currents in the short-cir-
cuiting ring, acting like a “magnetic insula-
tor”, limit the extent of the magnetic flux F 
to the space between the coil and the 
short-circuiting ring (hence its other name 
of shading ring) and thus make it depen-
dent on the position x of the short-circuit-
ing ring F = F(x). 

Inductance is defined:
L = F/I 

 

(1) 

This is why the position x of the short-cir-
cuiting ring also directly influences the in-
ductance L of the field coil. The relation-
ship L = L(x) shows a good linear fit over 
a wide domain. Virtually the entire length 
of the sensor can be utilized for measure-
ment purposes. A mechanically tight guid-
ance of the short-circuiting ring is not nec-
essary here.

The mass of the short-circuiting ring to 
be moved is very low. Shaping the gap be-
tween coil and limb has an effect upon the 
shape of the characteristic curve: reducing 
the gap towards the end of the measuring 
range further improves the already good 
linearity. Operation is generally in the 5 to 
50 kHz range, depending on material and 
structural shape. This sensor can also be 
used in very severe operating conditions, 
for instance on diesel fuel-injection pumps 
(Figs. 8, 9).

The cores are laminated (e.g. NiFe plate, 
0.2 mm thick) because of the alternating 
current operation. To achieve the necessary 
mechanical stability to keep the plates sta-
ble under acceleration, they are not only 
bonded in the normal fashion, but also in-
terlocked. To this end, the laminations are 
given a knobbly pattern in selected places 
which can be used to connect the lamina-
tions together before soft annealing (just 
like LEGO bricks), without interfering too 
much in the electrical insulation from lami-
nation to lamination required.

The half-differential short-circuiting 
ring sensor with moving measuring ring 
and fixed reference short-circuiting ring is 
very accurate; it is evaluated as an induc-
tive voltage divider (analysis of the induc-
tances L1/L2, or (L1 – L2)/(L1 + L2) or even as 
a frequency determining element of an os-
cillating circuit to generate a frequency 
analog signal (very interference-proof, 
easy to digitize).

Figure 9 shows the structure of a half-dif-
ferential short-circuiting ring sensor for 
diesel distributor-type injection pumps.  
A sensor coil and a reference coil are at-
tached to each leg of the core. As the alter-
nating current transmitted by the control 
unit permeates the coils, it creates alter-
nating magnetic fields. The reference 
short-circuiting ring is fixed in position, 
while the measuring short-circuiting ring 
is attached to the control-collar shaft (ad-
justment angle w). As the measuring short-
circuiting ring moves along, the magnetic 
flux changes and the voltage across the 
coil changes, since the control unit main-
tains the current constant (load-indepen-
dent current). An evaluation circuit forms 
the ratio of the output voltage UA to the 
measurement inductance L1 to the refer-
ence voltage URef to the reference induc-
tance L2. It is proportional to the excursion 
of the measuring short-circuiting ring and 
can be evaluated by the control unit.

Sensors with rotatable alternating fields
With alternating current of the angular fre-
quency v fed coils or coil-like structures 
(such as meandering conductor track 
structures) two or more pole alternating 
fields structures may be arranged either  
in a circle or even linearly. These pole 
structures with fixed pole pitch can be 
 displaced in relation to a generally fixed 
set of receiver coils having the same pole 
pitch, by the movement of the system to be 
measured, either rotary or translatorial. 
Here the amplitudes of the receiver signals 
are changing with the movement in a sinu-
soidal pattern. If the receiver coils are dis-
placed in relation to one another by a spe-
cific portion of the pole pitch T (e.g. T/4 or 
T/3), the sinus pattern is phase-shifted by 
a corresponding angle (e.g. by 90° or 120°). 
The voltages arise as follows, for instance:
(1) 
(2) 
 
 

u1 = U?sinw?sinvt
u2 = U?sin(w - 90°)?sinvt 
     = U?cosw?sinvt

or even:
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 

u1 = U?sinw
u1 = U?sin(w - 120°)?sinvt
u1 = U?sin(w - 240°)?sinvt

After rectification, the angle of rotation a 
can be calculated with great precision 
from these voltages. The sensors prefera-
bly made as angle sensors identified in 
classical measurement technology as syn-
chro, resolver or even inductosyn methods 
function in this way.

In a simple bipolar arrangement, the 
electrical phase angle also corresponds 
 directly to the mechanical angle of rota-
tion a. In an arrangement of n pole pairs, 
the mechanical full angle w = 2p is con-
verted into a phase displacement of 
a = n?2p, so that the phase displacement a 
corresponds only to an angle of rotation  
of only w/n, which considerably enhances 
the resolution of the measuring system. 
However, the unambiguity of the measure-
ment signal must be restored by additional 
means, such as a simple angle sensor,  
in larger measuring ranges.

Hella sensor
The angle sensor developed by Hella  
does not strictly correspond to any of the 
methods described above, but is most simi-
lar to the inductosyn method. Figure 10 
shows the sensor with a 6-count pole struc-
ture (n = 6), for instance, which electrically 
seen converts an angle of rotation of w = 60° 
into a phase displacement of the signal am-
plitudes of a = 360°. All the conductor track 
structures required are applied to multi-
layer PCBs, at least in the case of the fixed 
part (stator). The rotor may also be made  
as a stamped part, if necessary, either free-
standing or mounted on a plastic carrier 
(hot stamping).

A circular conductor track loop is made 
on the stator. This induces an eddy current 
at an operating frequency of 20 MHz in a 
closed meandering loop of approximately 
the same outside diameter on the rotor. 

Sensor measuring principles  |  Position sensors     175

This eddy current naturally generates a 
secondary magnetic field, just like the 
exciter loop, which superimposes itself on 
the excitation field in the sense that it at-
tempts to eliminate it. If the track on the 
rotor were only a circular conductor track 
congruent with the stator loop instead of 
the meandering track, this would simply 
extinguish the primary field to a great ex-
tent. The meandering structure, however, 
creates a resulting multi-pole field which 
can be rotated with the rotor and the total 
flux of which is also naturally almost zero.

This multi-pole alternating field is 

sensed by concentric receiver coils or me-
anders of practically identical form located 
on the stator. These are offset within a pole 
pitch (of e.g. 60°) by 1/3 each, i.e. electri-
cally in their signal amplitude by 120° each 
(Fig. 10b). The receiver coils however ex-
tend over all n pole pairs (series circuit) 
and use the sum of all pole fields.

According to Figure 10c, the receiver coils 
are connected in a star connection. Their 
signals are sent to an ASIC to determine 
the electrical phase angle a or mechani-
cal angle of rotation w, which applies the 
necessary (sign-correct) rectification, 
selection and ratio formation. A version 
ASIC 1 receives the digital control signals 
necessary for this from an adjacent mi-
crocontroller. A different version ASIC 2 
is, however, also capable of operating the 
sensor completely independently (on a 
stand-alone basis). The ASICS also permit 
an end-of-line calibration of the mechani-
cal and electrical tolerances in production. 
It is also possible, for the case of applica-
tions with elevated safety requirements, 
to construct a redundant system with two 
galvanically isolated signal paths and two 
ASICs. The sensor principle can also very 
advantageously be applied in a “cut-open” 
form as a travel sensor.

Magnetostatic sensors
Magnetostatic sensors measure a DC mag-
netic field. In contrast to the magnetically 
inductive (coil) sensors they are far more 
suitable for miniaturization and can be 
manufactured at reasonable cost using 
 microsystem technology. As DC magnetic 
fields can reach through housing walls of 
plastic, and also those of non-ferromag-
netic metals, with no problems, magneto-
static sensors have the advantage that the 
sensitive, generally fixed part, can be well 
encapsulated and protected against the ro-
tating part, generally a permanent magnet 
or soft-magnetic conductive element – and 
also against the environment. Above all, 
galvanomagnetic effects (Hall and Gauss-
ian effects) are used, as well as anisotropic 
magnetoresistive (AMR and GMR) effects.

Galvanomagnetic effect
The Hall effect is normally evaluated using 
thin semiconductor wafers. If a current-
carrying wafer of this type is exposed 
 perpendicularly to magnetic induction B, 
the charge carriers are deflected by the 
Lorentz force normal to the field and the

current I by angle w from their otherwise 
straight path (Fig. 11). This means that it is 
possible to pick-off a voltage UH transverse 
to the current direction between two op-
posing points on the edge of the wafer pro-
portional to the field B and to the current I 
(Hall effect).
(2) 
  
 
 
 

UH = RH ? I ? B/d
where RH = Hall coefficient, 
d = wafer thickness

At the same time, the series impedance of 
the wafer increases independently of the 
field direction following an approximately 
parabolic characteristic curve (Gaussian 
effect, magnetoresistor). 

The coefficient determinant for the mea-
surement sensitivity of the wafer RH is only 
comparatively small for silicon. As the 
 wafer thickness d can be made extremely 
thin, however, using diffusion techniques, 
the Hall voltage amounts to a technically 
usable magnitude. When silicon is used as 
the basic material, a signal-conditioning 
circuit can be integrated on the wafer. Sen-
sors using these principles are very cheap 
to produce. Silicon is by a long way not the 
best semiconductor material for Hall sen-
sors in respect of measurement sensitivity 
and temperature sensitivity. III-V semicon-
ductors such as gallium arsenide or indium 
antimonide possess better characteristics.

Hall switch
In the most simple case, the Hall voltage is 
applied to an electronic threshold circuit 
(Schmitt trigger) built into the sensor 
which then outputs a digital signal. If the 
magnetic induction B applied at the sensor 
is below a given minimum threshold level, 
the Schmitt trigger’s output value corre-
sponds to a logical “0” (release status);  
if it exceeds a given upper threshold the 
output value corresponds to a logical “1” 
 (operate status). Since this behavior is 
 guaranteed across the complete operating-
temperature range and for all sensors of a 
given type, the two threshold values are 
relatively far apart (approx. 50 mT). A con-

siderable induction jump DB is thus neces-
sary to operate the Hall switch.

Sensors manufactured in bipolar tech-
nology of this kind were used in Hall vane 
switches (Fig. 12), for example, as were fit-
ted in the housing for the camshaft-driven 
ignition distributor. This Hall vane switch 
contains the sensor and a permanent mag-
net and soft magnetic conductive ele-
ments. The magnetic circuit is U-shaped or 
forked in such a way that a trigger wheel 
vane in soft magnetic material can travel 
through the open end, alternately screen-
ing or exposing the magnet, thereby tog-
gling the Hall sensor between the operate 
and release states. 

A further application is the digital steer-
ing-angle sensor LWS3 (see “Hall angular-
position sensor up to 360°”).

Hall sensors of this type may be very 
cost-effective, but are really only good for 
a switch operation and are too imprecise 
for capturing analog values.

Hall sensors using the spinning-current 
principle
A disadvantage of a simple silicon Hall 
sensor is its simultaneous sensitivity to the 
unavoidable mechanical strain (piezoelec-
tric effect) resulting from the packaging, 
leading to unfavorable temperature sensi-
tivity of the offset. Applying the spinning 
current principle (Fig. 13), associated with 
a transition to CMOS technology, has over-
come this disadvantage. Although the 
piezoelectric effect still occurs here, it is 
compensated for by the signal being aver-
aged over time, as it occurs with a different 
sign in the case of very rapid electronically 
controlled interchange (rotation) of the 
electrodes. If it is wished to save the ex-
pense of the complex electronics for 
switching the electrodes, it is possible also 
to integrate several Hall sensors (two, four 
or eight) with correspondingly different 
alignment of the current paths in close 
proximity and to add their signals together 
in order to form an average. It is only in 
this way that the Hall ICs were also suit-
able for analog sensor applications.

These measures though did not result in a 
reduction of the considerable effects of 
temperature on the sensor’s measurement 
sensitivity. 

Such Hall ICs are suitable above all for 
the measurement of small travel distances, 
in which they register the fluctuating field 
strength of a permanent magnet as it ap-
proaches (e.g. the iBolt force sensor de-
tects the passenger’s weight to optimize 
the triggering of the airbag). Similarly 
good results could, in the past, only be 
achieved by using single Hall elements,  
e.g. in III-V compounds with a hybrid am-
plifier connected downstream (e.g. Hall 
 acceleration sensor).

Differential Hall sensors
The double Hall sensor (differential Hall 
sensor, Fig. 14) has two complete Hall sys-
tems mounted at a specified distance from 
each other on one chip. The associated 
electronics evaluate the difference be-
tween the two Hall voltages. The advan-
tage of such sensors lies in the fact that 
their output signal is for the most part 
 independent of the absolute value of the 
magnetic-field strength, and as differential 
sensors they only register the magnetic in-
duction’s change in space, in other words 
the field gradient (thus the common name 
of gradient sensor). 

Since the polarity of their output signal 
is independent of the air gap between ro-
tor and sensor, these sensors are mostly 
used for rotational-speed measurement.  
If a simple Hall sensor only is used to 
sense a gear wheel, this will not be able to 
distinguish whether the magnetic flux has 
modified as a result of the gear wheel turn-
ing further or by a change in distance (e.g. 
vibrations, mounting tolerances). Signifi-
cant scanning errors occur, as the signal 
must be passed to a threshold detector. 
The situation with differential sensors is 
fundamentally different. Here only the dif-
ference in the signals from two Hall sen-
sors located at a suitable distance from 
one another around the circumference is 
evaluated. If the signal difference is posi-
tive, for example, it is possible to freely 
vary the distance between the gear wheel 
and sensor; the difference will remain pos-
itive, even if the absolute value may be-
come smaller. The sign can only change  
if the rotor turns further. A threshold de-
tector connected afterwards thus has no 
problem in distinguishing between a 
change in distance and rotation.

Usually, in order to achieve as high an 
 output signal as possible, the distance be-
tween the two Hall sensors each located  
on the edge of the (elongated) chip is then 
selected to correspond to about half an 
 increment (half the rotor tooth interval).

The signal maximum is very wide and cov-
ers a broad range of variation of the incre-
ment spacing. More pronounced varia-
tions in the spacing necessitate a highly 
complex redesign of the sensor.

A gradient sensor must be precisely 
aligned to the rotor’s direction of rotation.

Hall angular-position sensors in the range 
up to approximately 180°
Using a rotatable magnetic ring (“movable 
magnet”), together with a number of fixed 
soft-magnetic conductive elements, a lin-
ear output signal can be generated for a 
larger angular range without conversion 
being necessary (Fig. 15). In this case, the 
bipolar field of the magnet ring is passed 
through a Hall sensor arranged between 
semicircular conductive elements. The ef-
fective magnetic flux through the Hall sen-
sor is dependent on the angle of rotation w. 
This principle is used on accelerator-

pedal sensors.

The Type ARS1 Hall angular-position 
 sensor with a measuring range of ap-
prox. 90° (Fig. 16) is derived from the basic 
“movable magnet” principle. The magnetic 
flux from a practically semicircular perma-
nent-magnet disk is returned to the mag-
nets through a pole shoe, two additional 
conductive elements each of which con-
tains a Hall sensor in its magnetic path, 
and the shaft which is also ferromagnetic. 
Depending upon the angular setting, the 
flux is led to a greater or lesser degree 
through the two conductive elements, in 
the magnetic path of which a Hall sensor  
is also situated. Using this principle, it is 
possible to achieve a practically linear 
characteristic in the measuring range.

The Type ARS2 is a simplified version 
which does without soft magnetic conduc-
tive elements (Fig. 17). In this version, the 
magnet moves around the Hall sensor in a 
circular arc. Only a relatively small section 
of the resulting sinusoidal characteristic 
curve features good linearity. If the Hall 

sensor is located slightly outside the cen-
ter of the circular arc, the characteristic 
curve increasingly deviates from the sinu-
soidal, It now features a short measuring 
range of just 90°, and a longer measuring 
range of a little over 180° with good linear-

ity. A great disadvantage though is the low 
level of shielding against external fields, as 
well as the remaining dependence on the 
geometric tolerances of the magnetic cir-
cuit, and the intensity fluctuations of the 
magnetic flux in the permanent magnet as 
a function of temperature and age.

Angular-position sensors in the range up to 
approximately 360°
Figure 18 shows an analog Hall angular-
position sensor with a measuring range  
of up to 360°. As shown, a permanent mag-
net rotates in front of two Hall sensors ar-
ranged at right angles to each other. The 
magnet should be adequate in size in order 
not to be too dependent on the tolerance 
of the magnet positioning. The two Hall 
sensors, fitted as closely together as possi-
ble, should here be positioned in the ho-
mogeneously directed portion of the per-
manent-magnet’s stray field, which also 
represents the angular location w of the 
permanent magnet. They are perpendicu-
lar to one another and parallel with the 
permanent magnet’s rotary axis. When the 
field-strength vector B rotates past the 
sensors, therefore, they register its x and 
y components:

The angle w can be calculated using the

A Hall sensor arrangement of this nature 
can also, in principle, be integrated verti-
cally with VHD (Vertical Hall Devices) in 
the manner illustrated so that the plane of 
the sensor chip is arranged perpendicular 
to the axis of rotation and the sensor has 
an in-plane sensitivity, unlike a normal, 
planar Hall sensor (Fig. 19). Monolithic in-
tegration also guarantees the high level of

ment and for the requisite compact form of

the two Hall systems. Sentron (Melexis), of 
Switzerland, is working on sensors of this 
type and will be launching them on the 
market in the near future.

Angular-position sensors of this type were 
considered for the implementation of 
starter motor-less instant start systems,  
for instance, where the absolute rotary 
 position of the camshaft over a 360° range 
must be measured.

There is, however, another trick which can 
be exploited to (additionally) give a nor-
mal, planar Hall sensor an in-plane sensi-
tivity. In the case of the method used by 
Melexis-Sentron (e.g. its 2SA-10 model) a 
total of four Hall sensors are mounted on 
the same chip in a tight circle offset at 90° 
to one another to measure the field com-
ponents Bx and By. To be accurate, in this 
case, each sensor consists of a Hall ele-
ment pair rotated at 90° for its part for the 
reasons described above. Once the chip 
has been manufactured, a circular disk  
of soft magnetic material approximately 
200 µm in diameter is fixed on its surface 
as shown in Figure 20 in such a way that 
the Hall sensors are located exactly be-
neath the edge of the disk.

Because of its high relative permeability, 
this disk acts as a flow concentrator (IMC, 
Integrated Magnetic Concentrator) and 
compels all field lines to pass into its sur-
face vertically. This compels the field lines 
running horizontally (in-plane) without 
the concentrator into a vertical direction 
(out-of-plane) at the position of the Hall 
sensors and thus they can modulate the 
Hall elements. As diagonally opposing 
elements each see fields in opposite direc-
tions, the difference between the two Hall 
voltages running in opposite directions is 
evaluated to capture a field component. At 
the same time, any vertical components Bz 
present have their effect eliminated. 

The additional evaluation of the summary 
signals of diagonally opposing elements 
can also be used to capture the vertical 
field component Bz; since these are not in 
the slightest influenced by the ferromag-
netic disk and the elements have also not 
lost their normal out-of-plane sensitivity

by it being fitted. In this way, an arrange-
ment of this type can be used to capture 
the induction vector B acting at the sensor 
location in all its three components. The 
electronic circuitry required to evaluate 
the signals including a µC-based digital 
signal processor (DSP) used to calculate 
the arctan function and the means re-
quired for an end-of-line calibration of  
the sensor (EEPROM) can cost-effectively 
also be integrated on the same chip as the 
sensor.

In order to measure angles up to 360°, it is 
sufficient to rotate a permanent magnet, 
preferably round in form, magnetized in 
parallel with the chip over the sensor chip 
with its integrated signal processing 
(Fig. 21). As the angle of rotation is formed 
using the arctan function from the ratio of 
the two sine wave and cosine wave sensor 
signals, the strength of the magnetic field, 
and thus also the aging of the magnets, its 
temperature sensitivity and its distance 
from the sensor surface are largely irrele-
vant. Only the rotary position of its magne-
tization is detected.

The maximum intrinsic deviation of the 
sensor is stated by the manufacturer as  
+ 2° for a measuring range of 360°. This 
can, however, be significantly improved 
by the user on calibration of the sensor. 
The accuracy of the digital output is then 
10 bits at a resolution of 12 bits. Because of 
the processing time required by the signal 
processor, the smallest sampling rate for 
a timing frequency of 20 MHz is 200 µs. 
A pulse width modulated signal output 
can be operated at a maximum of 1 kHz. 
The sensor needs 15 ms for initialization. 
A typical value for the measuring field 
strength is approximately 40 mT. The con-
centrator plate becomes saturated at flux 
densities in excess of 0.7 T. 

The sensor may also be programmed for 

any measurement range < 360° to good ef-
fect, with additional functional security 
being generated by out-of-range monitor-
ing (application as an angular-position 
sensor in the accelerator-pedal module 
FPM2.3, for instance).

Angles up to 360° may also be captured 
with the simplest Hall ICs (Hall switches), 
as are also used for the measurement of 
speeds of rotation, (application in LWS1 
type steering-angle sensors). Here, in or-
der to obtain an n-bit resolution, n Hall 
switches are arranged on a single track in 
a circle at equal distances from each other 
(Fig. 22). Depending upon its position, a 
rotatable soft-magnetic code disk blocks 
the magnetic field of the individual perma-
nent magnets located above each Hall 
switch, or opens it when it rotates further 
so that one after another the Hall switches 
generate n different code words (serial 
code). It is useful to apply the Gray code 
(cyclic binary code) to prevent errors in 
transitional states of the code disk. The 
Gray code is designed such that the code 
words for two adjacent positions – unlike 
the case with a natural binary code, for in-
stance – differ in only 1 bit, and so any in-
correct indication on the transition from 

Sensor measuring principles  |  Position sensors     183

one position to the next can never amount 
to more than one angular step.

For the practical implementation of a 
steering-wheel-angle sensor, the code disk 
is connected to the steering shaft for in-
stance, and the sensor’s non-moving parts 
to the vehicle body. One difficulty with this 
sensor is that the soft magnetic code disk 
must be mounted floating on the steering 
column for reasons associated with assem-
bly tolerances, which leads to a complex 
and space-hungry mounting there using a 
flexible plastic sleeve. Because of the air 
gap tolerance between the upper disk and 
the lower disk, the code disk is mounted  
in a wiping guide. A corresponding opto-
electronic solution using photoelectric 
light barriers is less satisfactory, as it is  
not possible to construct an adequate 
 encapsulation against the susceptibility  
of the sensor elements to dirt.

In order to measure a number of com-
plete rotations, an additional 3-bit configu-
ration can be used in which the code disk 
is rotated by a reduction gear. The resolu-
tion of such configurations is mostly no 
better than 2.5°.

Magnetoresistive sensors
In addition to the transversally directed 
Hall effect, there is also a longitudinal re-
sistance effect, also known as the Gaussian 
effect, that occurs on semiconductor wa-
fers. Elements that exploit this effect are 
known as magnetoresistors which are 
manufactured from a III-V-semiconductor 
(crystalline indium antimonide (InSb)).  
In contrast with the Hall sensors, the opti-
mum wafer shape for a magnetoresistor 
tends to be shorter and squatter, and rep-
resents a very low electrical resistance.  
In order to arrive at technically applicable 
values in the kV range, it is therefore nec-
essary to connect a large number of these 
wafers in series. This problem is solved 
 elegantly by adding microscopically fine, 
highly conductive nickel-antimonide nee-
dles to the semiconductor crystal. These 
are located transverse to the current direc-
tion. A further measure is to apply mean-
der techniques to the semiconductor resis-
tor (Figs. 23 and 24). 

The dependence of the resistance on the 
magnetic induction B follows a square-law 
function up to inductances of approx. 
0.3 T, and above this point it is increasingly 
linear. There is no upper limit to the con-
trol range, and dynamic response can be 
regarded as practically free from lag, as is 
the case for the Hall sensor.

Since their temperature sensitivity has a 
pronounced effect upon their resistance 
value (approximately 50 % reduction over 
100 K), they are usually supplied only in 
the dual-configuration form in voltage-di-
vider circuits (differential magnetoresis-
tors). For the particular application, each 
of the two resistor sections must then be 
magnetically triggered (as far as possible 
with opposite polarities). Notwithstanding 
the high temperature coefficients of the in-
dividual resistors, the voltage-divider cir-
cuit guarantees good stability of the work-
ing-point (that point at which both resistor 
sections have the same value).

In order to achieve good measurement 
sensitivity, it is best to operate the magne-
toresistors at a magnetic working point be-
tween 0.1 to 0.3 T. Generally, the required 
magnetic initial-tension is supplied by a 
small permanent magnet, the effects of 
which can be increased by using a small 
magnetic return plate. 

The magnetoresistor’s main advantage is 

its high signal level which is usually in the 
volts range. This means that amplification 
is unnecessary, as well as the local elec-
tronic circuitry and the associated protec-

tive measures which would otherwise be 
needed. Furthermore, in their role as pas-
sive, resistive components they are highly 
insensitive to electromagnetic interference 
and, as a result of their high bias voltage, 
practically immune against external mag-
netic fields.

Because of its pronounced temperature 
sensitivity, the magnetoresistor is used al-
most exclusively in incremental angular-
position and rev counters, or in binary 
limit-value sensors (with switching charac-
teristic).

Anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors 
(AMR)
Thin, only around 30 to 50 nm thick NiFe 
alloy coatings show an electromagnetically 
anisotropic behavior. That means that 
their electrical resistance changes under 
the influence of a magnetic field. Resis-
tance structures of this type are thus 
known as anisotropic magnetoresistive 
(abbreviated to AMR) elements or sensors. 
The metal alloy generally used is also 
known as permalloy.

Technology and designs
Even without an external control fields,  
a small spontaneous magnetization MS 
will arise in the longitudinal direction of  
a conductor track on a long slim resistor 
strip, as shown in Figure 25a, (shape an-
isotropy). In order to give this magnetiza-
tion a clearly defined direction – theoreti-
cally, it could be in the other direction – 
AMR sensors are often provided with weak 
bias magnets, as shown. In this state, the 
longitudinal resistance achieves its great-
est value Rll. If the magnetization vector is 
rotated under the effect of an additional 
external field Hy through angle q, the lon-
gitudinal resistance declines gradually un-
til it reaches its minimum value R  at q = 0. 
Here, the resistance depends only on the 
angle q which is enclosed by the resulting 
magnetization MS and the current I, and it 
has an approximately cosine wave pattern 
as a function of q:

R = R0?(1 + b?cos2 q) 
where Rll = R0?(1 + b) ; R  = R0

The coefficient b here identifies the maxi-
mum possible variation in resistance. It 
amounts to around 3 %. If the external 
field is much stronger than the spontane-
ous generated magnetization, and this is 
usually the case when permanent magnets 
are used, the effective angle q is almost 
completely a function of the direction of 
the external field. The field strength is now 
irrelevant, and in other words the sensor is 
now operating in a “saturated state”.
Highly-conductive short-circuiting 
strips (for instance of gold) on the AMR 
film force the current to flow at an angle of 
below 45° to the spontaneous magnetiza-
tion (longitudinal direction) without the 
application of an external field. As a result 
of this “trick”, the sensor curve shifts by 
45° compared to that of the simple resistor. 
This results in the so-called “Barber Pole” 
sensor. This means, therefore, that even 
with the external field strength Hy = 0, the 
curve is at the point of maximum measure-
ment sensitivity (reversal point). 

The striping of two resistors in opposite 
directions causes them to change their re-
sistances in opposite directions under the 
effects of the same field. In other words,

one of the resistances increases while the 
other drops. 

Being thin-film sensors, anisotropic 
magnetoresistive sensors also have the 
 advantage that they can be calibrated to  
a setpoint value (e.g. zero point) by laser 
trimming, for instance. In principle, the 
oxidized silicon wafers which serve as the 
substrate material can also incorporate the 
electronic circuitry for signal conditioning. 
At present, cost considerations dictate that 
sensor chips and electronic chips are for 
the most part manufactured separately, 
and then mounted and packaged in a com-
mon leadframe, for instance. The control-
ling magnetic field B is usually generated 
by magnets moving side-to-side or rotat-
ing over the sensor.

In addition to the simple, two-pole AMR 
elements, there are also pseudo Hall sen-
sors in practically square NiFe thin layer 
structures, that have four connections, just 
like normal Hall sensors. Two for the cur-
rent path and two transverse to this for 
pick-off a (pseudo) Hall voltage (Fig. 26). 
Unlike a normal Hall sensor, the pseudo 
Hall sensor, however, has its sensitivity to 
magnetic fields in the plane of the layer, 
and not perpendicular to it. In addition, it 
does not have a proportional characteris-
tic curve, but a sinusoidal one with very a

high match to a sinus wave, which does not 
depend in the least on the strength of the 
control field and the temperature. The out-
put voltage vanishes for a field parallel to 
the current path, to describe a sinus half-
period on rotation up to an angle w = 90°. 
The sinus voltage obtained in this way 
combined with the amplitude results in:
(6) 

 UH = uH?sin2w

If the external control field is rotated once 
through w = 360°, the output voltage follows 
two full sinus periods. The amplitude uH is, 
however, very dependent on the tempera-
ture and the air gap between the sensor 
and the control magnet; it declines with 
 increasing temperature and widening  
air gap.

The measurement sensitivity of the 
pseudo Hall element can be considerably 
increased (without excessively falsifying 
the sinusoidal shape) by “hollowing out” 
the element from the inside so that only 
the “frame” remains (Fig. 26b). This modi-
fication converts the pseudo Hall sensor to 
a full bridge consisting of four AMR resis-
tors from its geometrical form (Fig. 26c). 
Even when the bridge resistors are mean-
der-shaped, provided a given minimum 
conductor width is not fallen below, this 
still has negligible effect of the signal’s 
 sinusoidal shape.

Simple AMR angular-position sensor for  
ranges < 30°
Barber pole AMR angular-position sensors 
with limited precision and a restricted 
measuring range (max. ±15°) rely on the 
unbalance of a magnetoresistive voltage 
divider (differential sensor) comprising  
an elongated (possibly meander-shaped) 
permalloy resistor with highly conductive 
gold cross strips (Fig. 27). Although in  
the case of such sensors the zero point  
is largely independent of the distance be-
tween the magnet and the sensor, the gra-
dient of the characteristic curve, which for 
its part also depends on the temperature 
(TK around -3?10-3/K), on the other hand, 
is not. A sensor of this kind has already 
been considered as a cost-effective alter-
native for the measurement of pedal posi-
tions.

Simple AMR travel sensor for the mm range
Similarly, the simplest travel sensors may 
be built for a measuring range of typically 
just a few millimeters using individual 
 differential barber pole sensors (Fig. 28). 
However, to achieve good accuracy a con-
stant distance (air gap) is required be-
tween sensor and moving magnets, which 
embodies the position s to be measured. 
The temperature sensitivity of the charac-
teristic curve gradient can be very easily 
compensated for by means of an additional 
metallic thin-film sensor on the same car-
rier substrate, which will have around the 
same temperature coefficient, but with the 
inverse sign (e.g. Pt, Ti, Ni).

 

High-precision multisensor (POMUX) for 
travel ranges > 10 mm
There is an intelligent multisensor for po-
sition measurement built up with simple 
barber poles also known under the com-
mercial name of POMUX (position multi-
plexer). It exploits the fact that the symme-
try point or zero point of the characteristic 
curve is absolutely independent of the air 
gap and the temperature. Its use in a motor 
vehicle has often been considered (e.g. 
shock absorber stroke measurement), as it 
has excellent characteristics, in particular, 
extreme accuracy. It has also already been 
illustrated in a circular form as an angular-

position sensor for scanning a gravity pen-
dulum tuned to a low frequency, which 
may be used to determine the orientation 
of the vehicle (tilt sensor).

Angular-position sensor for 180° 
Pseudo Hall type magnetoresistive angu-
lar-position sensors utilize the practically 
100 % sinusoidal signal that is picked off 
from the output terminals of the four-pole, 
sensor structure, whereby two complete 
periods of the electrical output signal cor-
respond to a mechanical rotation of the 
magnets through 360°. Using a second ele-
ment, which has been turned through 45°, 
a  cosine signal is also generated (Fig. 30).  
By applying the arc-tangent function for 
instance, the relationship between the  
two signal voltages can be applied to 
 determine the measured angle using a 
 microcontroller or an ASIC. This applies 
throughout a range of 180°, and is for the 
most part independent of temperature 
changes and magnetic-field fluctuations 
(distance, aging).

A further prerequisite for the high accu-

racy of this sensor principle is that the 
field at both bridges is at least in the same 
direction (above a given magnitude, field 
strength is irrelevant). This can only be 
guaranteed when both bridges are directly 
above one another. A design was drawn up

Angular-position sensor for 360°
One serious drawback with AMR angular-
position sensors is their natural limitation 
to an unambiguously detectable angular 
range of 0° to 180°. This restriction may, 
however, be overcome by modulation of 
the direction of the magnetic flux by 
means of an alternating auxiliary magnetic 
field (Fig. 31). By contrast with the COS 
and SIN sensor signals which have a 180° 
periodicity, these modulation signals have 
a 360° periodicity. In this way it is possible, 
simply by evaluating the sign of the modu-
lation signals, to distinguish between

ranges and thus to double the unambigu-
ous range to 0° to 360°. Because the auxil-
iary field for the two sensor bridges points 
in different directions, the two modulation 
signals are phase-shifted. It is sufficient,  
to distinguish ranges, merely to determine 
the sign of the largest modulation signal in 
respect of absolute value. This means that 
distinguishing the ranges is not critical and 
is still easily possible, even in the case of 
modulation signals suffering heavy inter-
ference.

The magnetic auxiliary field is generated 
by a planar coil integrated into the AMR 
sensor chip (Fig. 32). The auxiliary field  
in the COS and SIN full bridge points in 
 directions 45° apart in accordance with  
the wiring arrangement.

The sensor can only be mounted on the 
end of a rotating shaft. Thus, for instance, 
it may be mounted on the end of the steer-
ing spindle for measuring the steering-
wheel angle in systems that do not require 
determination of multiple rotations of the 
steering spindle (e.g. steering-angle sensor 
LWS4).

Angular-position sensor in the range over 
360° (multiple revolutions)
A dual-configuration of pseudo-Hall angu-
lar-position sensors (180°) can be used to 
measure multiple rotations of a rotating 
component, a steering spindle, for in-
stance. The two associated permanent 
magnets are rotated via a step-up gear 
train (Fig. 33). As the two driving smaller 
gear wheels, which carry the control mag-
nets, differ by one tooth (number of teeth 
m and m+1), their mutual phase difference 
(difference of the angle of rotation: C - U) 
is an unambiguous measure of the abso-
lute angle position w of the steering spin-
dle. The system is designed such that this 
phase difference does not exceed 360° in  
a total of four revolutions of the steering 
spindle and so the unambiguity of the 
measurement is ensured. Each individual 
sensor also offers an indeterminate fine 
resolution of the angle of rotation. Using 
such a configuration, it is possible for in-
stance to determine the complete steering-
wheel range with a resolution of better 
than 1° (this principle is applied in the 
LWS3 steering-angle sensor).

Giant magnetoresistive sensors (GMR)
GMR sensor technology was developed a 
few years ago and is now finding its first 
applications in sensing angles and speeds 
of rotation in the automotive sector.

The essential advantages of GMR sensors 
over AMR sensors are the natural 360° 
range of unambiguity in angle sensing and 
the higher sensitivity to magnetic fields in 
speed of rotation sensing.

Unlike AMR sensors, GMR sensors con-
sist not of one magnetic function layer, but 
rather of a complex system of layers. A dis-
tinction is essentially made between two 
systems: on the one hand the GMR multi-
layers with typically some 20 sequences of 
alternating soft magnetic and nonmagnetic 
individual layers (Fig. 34a). On the other 
hand there are the GMR spin valves, com-
prising antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic 
and nonmagnetic functional layers. The in-
dividual layer thickness are in the 1 to 5 nm 
range in both systems, and so embrace just 
a few atomic layers.

The electrical resistance of a GMR layer 

stack depends on the angle between the 
magnetizations of adjacent ferromagnetic 
individual layers. It is at its maximum 
when they are aligned antiparallel and at 
their minimum when in parallel alignment 
(Fig. 34b).

GMR multilayers
The relative change in resistance (GMR ef-
fect) is 20 to 30 % in GMR multilayers and 
thus is ten times greater than the AMR ef-
fect. A hard magnetic layer, which will pro-
vide a suitable bias field, is added to the 
GMR multilayer stack to place the working 
point in a sensitive region of the character-
istic curve. The sensitivity of a sensor 
structure of this nature is about 0.8 %/mT 
which makes it greater than that of AMR 
barber pole structures.

GMR spin valves
Unlike the GMR multilayers, GMR spin 
valves (Fig. 35) are also suitable for angle 
sensing. In the latter, the reference magne-
tization necessary for angle sensing is gen-
erated, fixing (pinning) the direction of 
magnetization of one of the ferromagnetic 
layers (FM1) through interaction with an 
adjacent antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer. 
This is hence also known as the “pinned 
layer”. On the other hand, the magnetiza-
tion of the second ferromagnetic layer

Like an AMR angular-position sensor,  
a GMR angular-position sensor consists  
of two full bridges, of which one supplies  
a cosine-wave signal and the other a sine 
signal depending on the external field di-
rection (Fig. 37). The different magnetic 
reference directions MR required to 
achieve this are generated by local heating 
of the individual bridge resistors and cool-
ing in the presence of a magnetic field of 
suitable orientation. The field direction 
can be unambiguously determined over 
the full angular range from 0° to 360° by  
an arctan function.

37 GMR angular-position sensor with two full bridges

a

coupled by a nonmagnetic interlayer, is 
freely rotatable using the external mag-
netic field. This is accordingly known as 
the “free layer”. 

The resistance varies with a cosine-wave 

dependency on the angle w between the 
external field direction and the reference 
direction. The stability of the reference 
magnetization against the action of the ex-
ternal field is decisive for the accuracy of 
the angular measurement. This stability is 
significantly enhanced by the use of an ad-
ditional synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) 
(Fig. 36). This consists of two ferromag-
netic layers which are strongly antiferro-
magnetically coupled through a very thin 
nonmagnetic interlayer and, because of 
their vanishing magnetic net moment, no 
longer offer a face for the external field to 
attack. The magnetization of one of these 
two layers is pinned by the adjacent natu-
ral antiferromagnet (AFM). Both the inter-
action of the pinned layer (PL) with the 
natural antiferromagnet (AFM) and the 
mutual interaction of the ferromagnetic 
layers (PL, RL, FL) are determinant for the 
magnetic behavior of the layer system. 
Furthermore, the behavior is also formed 
by the shape and crystal anisotropy of the 
individual magnetic layers, as is the case 
with the AMR sensor structures.

Wave-propagation sensors
In recent years, the development of sen-
sors has concentrated increasingly on sen-
sors that acquire information from the im-
mediate and more distant surroundings of 
the vehicle. This refers to the distance to 
other vehicles or traffic and to obstacles 
(all-round view from the vehicle, Fig. 38), 
either for safety reasons or to support ve-
hicle handling.

Ultrasound propagation time methods 
are suitable for vehicle-to-vehicle distance 
monitoring in the near range (0.5 to 5 m), 
with optical propagation time or triangula-
tion methods using short-wave infrared 
light (lidar) for the medium range up to  
50 m, and electro magnetic radar for the 
long range (up to 150 m).

Ultrasound sensors
According to the echo-sounding process 
(Fig. 39), the sensors transmit ultrasound 
pulses with a frequency of around 40 kHz, 
and record the time taken for the echo 
pulses to arrive having been reflected back 
from an obstacle. The distance l from the 
send/receive head to the closest obstacle  
is determined from the propagation time t 
of the first echo pulse to arrive and the 
 velocity of sound c thus:
(8) 

l = 0.5?t?c

In practice, the geometrical distance a be-
tween an obstacle and the front of the ve-
hicle is determined using the triangulation 
method from the results measured (dis-
tance b and c) from two ultrasound heads, 
mounted at a distance d from one another 
(Fig. 40): 

Long-range radar sensors (76 GHz)
The vehicle-speed controller fitted is 
equipped with a long-range radar sensor 
(adaptive cruise control, ACC) for the auto-
matic detection of vehicles preceding in 
the same lane or even of obstacles in the 
path of the vehicle which could eventually 
necessitate application of the brakes. The 
working frequency is 76 GHz (wavelength 
l ≈ 3.8 mm) permits the relatively compact 
construction as needed for automotive ap-
plications. A Gunn oscillator (Gunn diode 
in the cavity resonator) feeds in parallel 
four adjacently arranged patch antennas, 
for example, which also serve to receive 
the reflected signals. Referred to the vehi-
cle axis, a plastic Fresnel lens in front con-
centrates the transmit and receive beam 
horizontally and vertically. 

The signal reflected on the vehicle in 
front is delayed in accordance with the 
propagation time. The distance a to the 
 vehicle in front and its relative speed Dv

GPS position and distance traveled 
measurement
GPS is the global positioning system using 
satellites, originally created by the USA for 
military purposes, but later increasingly re-
leased for civil uses. The system was com-
pleted in 1993 with a total of 24 satellites 
(21 operating, three in reserve) orbiting at 
an altitude of 20,183 km. More than 24 sat-
ellites have since become available. They 
are distributed over six circular orbital 
planes taking 12 hours to complete an orbit 
and so at least four (but generally up to 
eight) satellites are always visible above the 
horizon from any point on the earth’s sur-
face. They transmit continuous (digital) sig-
nals on a carrier frequency of 1.57542 GHz. 
The signals contain the following message, 
in simple terms:

than 20 to 30 ns on board for the high-pre-

cision determination of the transmission 
time. The signal propagation times to be 
evaluated lie typically in the region of ap-
proximately 70 ms. The satellites identify 
themselves with a pseudo random code 
(PRN number), which is 1,023 bits long 
and is continuously repeated after every 
1 ms. It is imposed on the carrier as a 
phase modulation.

A user can take this information and de-

termine his own geographical position in 
three dimensions with a GPS receiver, con-
sisting of a GPS antenna, signal receiver, 
precision clock and microprocessor. Theo-
retically, the signals from three satellites 
are sufficient for this; since, however, the 
less complex clocks in mobile receivers 
(oscillating crystals) can differ from the 
satellite clocks somewhat, a fourth satellite 
must be used in order to eliminate the 
 errors generated by the receiver clock. 
The distance to the visible satellites is de-
rived from the signal propagation times 
measured. 

The position is determined – as shown  

in Figure 40 in only two dimensions of 
space – then using a trilateration method, 
according to which there is precisely one 
point in space which satisfies the three di-
mensional conditions. In addition, there is 
also the knowledge that the motor vehicle, 
unlike an airplane, must be located on the 
earth’s surface. Measurement is thus the 
more accurate the more satellites can be 
received and the better, i.e. the more uni-
formly the satellites are distributed across 

the sky. Since complete release for civil 
use (May 2000), the accuracies obtainable 
are about 3 to 5 m in a plane and around  
10 to 20 m in the determination of altitude. 
With the refinement of GPS to DGPS (Dif-
ferential GPS, mobile stations have contact 
with a fixed reference station via long 
wave signals) this variance can be signifi-
cantly further reduced. This makes resolu-
tions down to less than 1 m possible today. 

These accuracies are the more astonishing 
when the manifold sources of error in this 
very complex measurement is taken into 
consideration. For example, simply the 
fact that at the very high velocity of ap-
proximately 12,000 km/h at which the 
 satellites move, relativistic effects already 
play a not insignificant role. Time passes 
more slowly at high velocities than it does 
on earth. Time passes more quickly in 
weaker gravitational fields as are found in 
the orbital planes. The high velocity causes 
a dilation of time of 7.2 µs per day, the 
lower gravitation even has an effect that  
is around six times greater, although 
 opposing.

If the position data determined in a 
close sequence is stored in a mobile GPS 
receiver, such as in a motor vehicle, it is 
easy to derive the orbit and the speed of 
the vehicle. If the data is sent via a radio 
module to a fixed central location, the lo-
cation of the vehicle at any time will then 
be known.

Relative rpm and speed measurement
Examples of relative rotational speed are 
as follows: 
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Crankshaft and camshaft rotational speed

Here, measurement usually makes use of 
an incremental pick-up system comprised 
of a gear wheel and a speed sensor.

In the detection of relative yaw rate, de-
pending upon the number and size of the 
scanned rotational rotor markings, a dis-
tinction is made between the following 
types of sensor (Fig. 1):
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Increment sensor with closely spaced 
rotational markings. Up to a certain 
point, this form of sensor permits in-
stantaneous speed to be measured at 
points on the circumference, or the reg-
istration of very fine angular divisions.

of engine cylinders).

scanned marking per revolution, so that 
only the average rotational speed can be

Speed and rpm sensors

Measured variables
Speed and rpm sensors measure the num-
ber of revolutions or the distance traveled 
per unit of time. When automotive applica-
tions are concerned, these are in both 
cases measured variables which occur 
 between two components or with respect 
to the road surface or another vehicle. 
However, it is also necessary to measure 
the absolute rotational speed in space or 
about the vehicle axes (yaw rate). For in-
stance, for the electronic stability program, 
the yaw rate about the vehicle’s vertical (or 
yaw) axis must be determined by sensing.

Measuring principles
Conventional sensors used for rotational-
speed measurement are based on pro-
nounced measuring effects (e.g. inductive). 
They are therefore for the most part elec-
trically passive. That is, they are usually 
not provided with any form of local/on-site 
electronics. With the newer sensors, how-
ever, measurement is based on less-pro-
nounced measuring effects (for instance, 
the Hall effect), and these sensors thus 
need local, integrated electronics for signal 
conditioning. They belong in the broadest 
sense to the category of “intelligent sen-
sors” (which are also often referred to as 
“active” sensors). 

In fact, the sensors used for measuring 

absolute rotating speed (yaw rate) need 
highly complex electronic circuitry di-
rectly at the sensor since the measuring 
 effects used here are not only particularly 
small, but also require complex signal con-
ditioning.

Incremental rotational-speed measure-
ment takes advantage of a wide variety of 
different physical effects (some of which 
can be applied in sensors at a very reason-
ably price). Optical and capacitive sensors, 
though, are highly unsuitable for the rough 
operating conditions encountered in the 
motor vehicle. Here, magnetic-effect sen-
sors are used almost exclusively.

Sensor shapes
The following shapes of sensor are presently 
in use (Fig. 2) for speed and rpm sensors:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Rod sensor
  Fork-shaped sensor 
  (Internal and external) toroidal sensor 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

The preferred form is the rod sensor, in 
which the rotor teeth approach the sensor 
and which is also the easiest to install. The 
fork-shaped sensor is permissible in some 
cases, and is also in service in the field. 
This sensor must be roughly aligned to  
the rotor when installed. The sensor type 
in which the sensor surrounds the rotor 
shaft in the form of a ring is practically no 
longer used. From time to time, an inner-
ring sensor is used which is introduced 
into the end of a hollow shaft featuring an 
incremental internal structure. 

Unfortunately, although it is the most 
widely used sensor type, the rod-shaped 
sensor features the lowest measurement 
sensitivity and is problematical when air 
gaps become excessive. The fork-shaped 
sensor on the other hand is practically im-
pervious to axial and radial play. Regard-
ing toroidal sensors, the most widely used 
form combines a large measurement signal 
with pronounced insensitivity to geometric 
tolerances.

In many respects, the traditional inductive-
type sensors are highly unsatisfactory. 
Their output signal features an rpm-depen-
dent amplitude, and for this reason they are 
unsuitable for measuring low rotational 
speeds. In addition, they only permit com-
paratively low-level air-gap tolerances and 
are usually unable to differentiate between 
air-gap fluctuations and genuine rotational-
speed pulses. And at least the sensor tip 
must resist high temperatures when in-
stalled near hot components (e.g. the 
brakes). These disadvantages are behind 
the additional features aimed at with new, 
innovative sensors:

or at extremely low cranking or wheel 
speeds)

Magnetostatic sensors (Hall, magnetore-
sistors, AMR) are highly suitable for com-
plying with the first two demands. And, as 
a rule, they also permit compliance with 
the second and third stipulations. 

Figure 3 shows three fundamentally suit-
able sensor shapes, which generally are in-
sensitive to air-gap fluctuations. Here, one 
must differentiate between sensors which 
sense radially and those which sense tan-
gentially. This means that independent of 
the air gap, magnetostatic sensors are always 
able to differentiate between the north and 
south poles of a magnetically active pole 
wheel or rotor ring. 

In the case of magnetically passive ro-
tors, the sign of the output signal is then 
no longer independent of the air gap when 
they register the tangential-field strength 
(here though, the fact that the air gap is

 often enlarged due to the sensor is a disad-
vantage). 

Radially measuring differential-field or 
gradient sensors are often used. These al-
ways register only the gradients of the ra-
dial-field components, the signs of which 
do not change with the air gap but only 
with the angle of rotation.

Rotors
The rotor is of decisive importance when 
measuring rotational speed. It is usually 
provided by the vehicle manufacturer, 
while the sensor itself comes from a com-
ponent supplier. Previously, magnetically 
passive rotors have been used almost ex-
clusively. These are made from magneti-
cally soft materials (usually iron), and are 
less expensive than magnetically hard ro-
tors (also known as pole wheels). Apart 
from that, since they are not magnetized 
they are easier to handle, and there is no 
danger of mutual demagnetization (for in-
stance during storage). Unfortunately, this 
form of rotor is the most difficult to scan, 
particularly in combination with rod sensors.

As a rule, presuming the same increment 
width and output signal, the pole wheel’s 
intrinsic magnetism (a pole wheel is de-
fined as a magnetically active rotor) per-
mits a considerably larger air gap. 

Normally, passive rotors are in the form of 
gear wheels. In many cases, these are al-
ready present on the engine (for instance 
the starter ring gear). Otherwise they must 
be installed in a specific position in order 
to generate the required signal (as needed 
for instance for ABS). In the latter case, 
both planar-toothed and axial-scan ver-
sions are in use. 

An easily identifiable reference mark is 
required for each revolution when pick-off 
the crankshaft speed or position (for in-
stance, at the starter ring gear). This refer-
ence mark must allow a fault-free and 
 optimum timing of ignition and injection. 
The reference mark can be in the form of  
a completely (or partially) removed tooth. 
Due to the fact that a tooth space “takes 
more time”, the reference mark is immedi-
ately identifiable, particularly since the 
engine speed can only vary gradually and 
never abruptly.

In addition to gear wheels, stamped per-

forated disks or wave-shaped metal rings 
have been introduced in the meantime as 
low-priced rotors (ABS). 

It was the integration of ABS sensors in the 
vehicle’s wheel bearing which led to the in-
troduction of pole wheels some of which 
also assume the role of a sealing ring (plas-
tic-bound magnetic powder). Small, for the 
most part encapsulated, tachometer sen-
sors connected through a short flexible 
shaft with one of the vehicle’s wheels, also 
use pole wheels (with only very few poles) 
for generating a speed signal. These are 
usually picked off by means of integrated  
Hall sensors.

Inductive-type sensors
Inductive-type sensors were available on 
the market as coil versions long before the 
first suitable microstructure sensor ver-
sions (e.g. using the Hall principle) became 
available. Such inductive-type sensors use 
Faraday’s law when measuring rotational 
speed. In other words, they generate a 
voltage UA at their two-pole output which 
is proportional to the change (referred to 
time) of a magnetic flux F (w = number of 
turns).

UA = Uind = w ? dF/dt

The magnetic flux F is also a function of 
the rotational position x and the air gap dL:

where 
F = F(x, dL) and dL = const
the following applies:
UA = Uind = w ? −F/−x ? dx/dt

where dx/dt represents the (rotational) 
speed to be measured.

The inductive-type sensors’ weak point is 
underlined though by the equation: if it is 
impossible to keep the air gap dL constant 
(due to flutter or other forms of mechani-
cal play), the air-gap fluctuations induce 
the same change of flux as does a fluctua-
tion of speed. This effect can cause the

generation of voltage pulses which are 
 either impossible, or at least difficult, to 
separate from the genuine engine-speed 
signals. Since the flux varies exponentially 
along with the change in air gap, and the 
air-gap fluctuations are often of the high-
frequency type (e.g. brake flutter), these 
unwanted pulses can feature a high voltage 
amplitude.

Inductive-type sensors are therefore 
always of the dynamic type, and being as 
their output signal tends to fall to zero in 
such cases, they are in principle also un-
suitable for the detection of extremely low 
speeds (quasi-static or static). The only ex-
ception here are the coil sensors which are 
powered by a carrier frequency and which 
are based on the eddy-current or damping 
principle. These though are hardly ever 
used in automotive applications.

Basically, inductive speed sensors are 
comprised of three important magnetic 
component parts (Fig. 4):

  Fixed coil
  Soft-iron component 
  Permanent-magnet component 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

The change in flux needed for the genera-
tion of the output voltage results from the 
motion or rotation of the hard or soft-iron 
magnetic component. The inductive-type 
sensors are preferably composed of a  
rod magnet (1) with a soft-magnetic pole 
pin (2) carrying the 2-connection induc-
tion coil (3). When a ferromagnetic gear 
wheel (5), or some form of similar rotor, 
rotates in front of this sensor (pick-up) the 
changing magnetic flux (which varies as a 
function of time) induces a practically si-
nusoidal voltage. 

For scanning very fine tooth structures, 
the end of the pole pin is sometimes pointed 
and acts as a flux-concentrating element. 
In other words it is shaped like a pole “blade” 
which usually projects through the metal 
or plastic housing and is adapted to the in-
crement structure regarding shape and di-
rection.

The rotor can be provided with one or 
more rotational markings (6). Figure 5 
shows the flux curve and the voltage in-
duced by a single rotational or reference 
mark (slot, cam, or pole pin).

Normally, the steep passage through 
zero which takes place at the mid-point of 
maximum flux is utilized for the electronic 

detection of such a rotational or reference 
mark. According to Faraday’s Law, in all 
phases the signal’s amplitude is propor-
tional to rotational speed. 

In order to ensure adequate, interfer-
ence-free evaluation in the control unit,

pulse (or of a periodic voltage pulse) USS

The reference point is detected when the 
distance between the passages through 
zero changes abruptly and causes a far 
higher signal voltage (corresponding to  
an apparently larger tooth) which has a 
negative effect upon the previous and 
upon the subsequent incremental voltage – 
this can under certain circumstances be 
undesirable.

should be at least 30 mV. The major disad-
vantage of the inductive-type sensors is 
the fact that at high speeds/rotational 
speeds their output voltages can reach 
 levels far in excess of 100 V which are dif-
ficult to process electronically. 

If Zener diodes are used to clip the high 
voltage peaks, the resulting changes in the 
sensor’s load impedance lead to considerable 
phase-angle errors. With camshaft and 
crankshaft sensors this can have highly 
undesirable results with regard to the igni-
tion where the correctness of phase rela-
tionship must be better than approx. 0.2°.

Normally, the prepulse generated by the 
magnetic return field can be ignored at low 
speeds. With some magnetically passive or 
active rotational markings though, at high 
speeds the prepulse voltage can increase to 
such an extent that it exceeds the threshold 
value of the downstream threshold dis-
criminator and can cause an even greater 
error (Fig. 5a). For this reason, the thresh-
old values of the control unit input circuit 
are adapted dynamically to the speed in 
question.

row, a uniform tooth structure results in 
the practically sinusoidal voltage curve 
shown in Figure 5b. The speed is reflected 
in the periodic interval between the volt-
age’s zero transition points, while the am-
plitude is also proportional to the rotating 
speed. 

The signal amplitude is highly dependent 
(exponentially) upon air gap and tooth size. 
As is the case with all magnetic increment 
processes, up to air gaps of dL, teeth can be 
efficiently detected as from half or 1/3 of a 
tooth interval I.

dL ≤ l/(2…3)

The conventional ABS gear wheels and 
crankshaft applications cover air gaps of 
up to 0.8 and 1.5 mm respectively. The ref-
erence mark needed for the ignition and 
injection results from leaving out one or 
two teeth or by closing a tooth space.  

Provided that the air gap is not too nar-

  The output signal is rpm-dependent, 

Sensor measuring principles  |  Speed and rpm sensors     201

Magnetostatic sensors
Quasi-static speed measurement is best 
performed using magnetostatic sensors. 
Their output signal is independent of rota-
tional speed and depends solely on field 
strength, so that at high rotational speeds 
their low signal voltages are easier to han-
dle electronically. Furthermore, they not 
only have the advantage of imposing prac-
tically no limits with regard to miniaturiza-
tion, but also signal amplification and/or 
signal preprocessing can be integrated 
 locally. The fact that they are very small 
means that multiple systems such as dif-
ferential configurations, or arrangements 
with integrated recognition of direction, 
present no difficulties. 

On the other hand, such active sensors 

have a serious disadvantage, and that is 
the fact that their operating-temperature 
range is for the most part defined by the 
relevant Si (silicon) evaluation electronics 
which as a rule cannot withstand such high 
temperatures as the sensor element itself. 
For some time now, active sensors have 

been available with the option of a two-
pole current output, so that the two-core 
connection can no longer be regarded as  
a specific advantage of the inductive-type 
coil sensor.

Hall vane switches
If Hall Si sensors are to be used for incre-
mental rpm measurement, pronounced 
manufacturing scatter together with the 
effects of temperature mean that they must 
be provided with an adequate induction 
jump of typically 40 to 50 mT in order to 
ensure reliable high-speed switching. With 
conventional Hall sensors and acceptable 
air gaps, this was only possible with the 
sensor in the form of a “Hall vane switch” 
(for instance when used as ignition-trig-
gering sensors in the ignition distributor 
for earlier electronic ignition systems). 
The sensor and the electronic circuits  
for supply and signal evaluation are 
 integrated on the sensor chip.

This “Hall IC” (using bipolar technology, 
for sustained temperatures ≤ 150 °C, and 
for direct connection into the vehicle’s 
 onboard electrical supply), is located in  
a practically closed magnetic circuit com-
prising permanent magnet and pole pieces 
(Fig. 6). A soft-magnetic trigger wheel 
(driven, for instance, by the camshaft) 
 rotates through the remaining air gap. 
With a trigger-wheel vane in the air gap, 
the magnetic flux is short-circuited past 
the sensor element. On the other hand 
though, when a trigger-wheel opening 
passes through the air gap the flux is un-
hindered on its way to the sensor. This 
principle ensures that the sensor also per-
forms perfectly when the trigger-wheel 
varies in how far it penetrates into the air 
gap, or in case the air-gap shifts radially, 
that is vertically to the direction of rotation. 
Since Hall vane switches of this type fea-
ture limited rotational resolution they are 
mainly used as segment sensors. If the vane 
slot is too narrow, it is practically  impossible 
for the magnetic field to pass through, with 
the result that the required induction jump 
is not generated.

Simple Hall rod sensors
In contrast to the Hall vane switch, the 
working-point magnetization depends too 
much upon the width of the air gap, and 
the induction excursion is too small for 
 reliable switching with this configuration. 
Simple rod-shaped Hall sensors provided 
with a working-point magnet are therefore 
unsuitable for static or quasi-static scanning 
of a magnetically passive rotor (Fig. 7a, gear 
wheel). The switching point of a downstream 
threshold comparator (Schmitt trigger) 
would have to be continually adapted to 
the varying working point. Such applica-
tions are only feasible when DC coupling is 
dispensed with and therefore also static 
signal evaluation. The coupling capacitors 
required for such configurations (also 
known as DF sensors) involve high costs 
though and lead to reduced operational 
reliability.

However, simple Hall sensors are highly 
suitable for scanning a magnetically active 
rotor (Fig. 7b, pole wheel). The sensor is 
triggered by the pole wheel with varying 
polarity only in the vicinity of the magnetic 
zero point. Although the magnetic control 
excursion reduces along with increasing 
air gap, the position of the working point 

(B = 0) remains unchanged. Considering 
that the working point on new types of 
Hall sensors is to a great extent thermally 
stable, the switching points of the down-
stream threshold comparator can be set 
relatively close together. This means that 
relatively wide air gaps become possible. 
Air-gap fluctuations in this configuration 
cannot cause missing pulses as they do not 
lead to pole change. The pole change only 
characterizes the continuing measurement 
motion (rotation).

Gradient sensors
When it comes to scanning passive rotors, 
gradient sensors (Fig. 8) designed on the 
basis of differential Hall sensors or differ-
ential magnetoresistive sensors, are far 
better than simple Hall sensors. They are 
provided with a permanent magnet. This 
pole face of this magnet facing the gear 
wheel is homogenized by a thin ferromag-
netic wafer (2). Two galvanomagnetic ele-
ments (generic term for Hall sensors and 
magnetoresistors) are located on each ele-
ment’s sensor tip, at a distance of roughly 
one half a tooth. Thus, one of the elements 
is always opposite a tooth space when the 
other is opposite a tooth. The sensor mea-

sures the difference in field strength be-
tween two neighboring points on the cir-
cumference of the rotor. The output signal 
corresponds roughly to the field strength 
derived as a function of the angle at the 
circumference, and its sign is therefore in-
dependent of the air gap. Being as they do 
not alter the gradient signal’s sign, air-gap 
fluctuations does not cause missing pulses.
For signal evaluation, it is a simple mat-

ter to connect the two magnetoresistors  
as a voltage divider which is supplied by  
a constant voltage and whose (usually un-
loaded) output signal is registered by the 
control unit. At room temperatures and 
with the customary air gap, this signal is in 
the volts range, and even at high tempera-
tures it is suitable for transmission to the 
control unit without any form of preampli-
fication.

Provided appropriate circuitry is used, 

measuring the loaded output current of 
the magnetoresister divider instead of its 
open-circuit voltage permits the sensor’s 
pronounced temperature measurement 
sensitivity to be compensated for to a great 
extent. 

In the case of a gradient sensor based on 

the Hall effect, the current paths of both 
Hall elements can be connected in parallel, 
and their opposite-polarity output voltages 
in series, so that their differential voltage 
can be picked off directly and inputted to 
the downstream amplification and evalua-
tion stages.

Tangential sensors
Tangential sensors differ from gradient 
sensors by their reaction to variations in 
polarity and intensity in the components 
of a magnetic field located tangentially to 
the periphery of the rotor. Using AMR 
thin-film techniques, tangential sensors 
are available as barber-pole or permalloy 
resistor types in full-bridge or half-bridge 
circuits (Fig. 9). In contrast to gradient 
sensors, they need not be matched to the 
particular tooth pitch of the rotor and can 
in fact be designed to sense practically at a 

given point. Local amplification is neces-
sary, even though their measuring effect is 
approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude 
larger than that of the silicon Hall sensors.
In the case of the crankshaft speed sen-

sor integrated in the bearing (composite 
seal with sensor), the AMR thin-film sen-
sor is mounted together with an evaluation 
IC on a common leadframe.

For the purposes of space saving and 
temperature protection, the evaluation IC 
is bent at an angle of 90° and also located 
further away from the sensor tip.

Giant magnetoresistive (GMR) elements
The giant magneto resistance effect (GMR 
effect) was first demonstrated on multilay-
ers consisting alternately of thin soft mag-
netic and nonmagnetic layers (thickness of 
a few nanometers). An antiparallel align-
ment of the magnetization of adjacent fer-
romagnetic layers leads to the maximum 
electrical resistance, while parallel align-
ment shows a significantly lower resistance. 
The relative change in resistance for appli-
cation-relevant layer structures thus var-
ies in the range 20 to 30 %. This represents 
an increase over the AMR effect by a factor 
of around 10.

A bridge circuit of four GMR resistance 
elements, designed as a gradiometer is 
suited for the determination of rotational 
speed (Fig. 12). The resistors are intercon-
nected here in such a way that only one 
magnetic field difference at the two bridge 
locations results in a signal. The effects 
of homogenous interference fields can be 
suppressed in this way. As the reference 
direction for all resistors is identical, local 
heating in the magnetic field, as is neces-
sary to write differing reference magne-
tization directions in an angular-position 
sensor, is not required.

11 Characteristic curve for a GMR spin valve

The simplest layer system that shows a 
GMR effect is a spin valve (see also “Posi-
tion sensors” section). It consists of two 
soft magnetic layers, separated by a non-
magnetic layer. While the magnetization  
of the one soft magnetic layer is fixed by  
an antiferromagnet, the magnetization of 
the second soft magnetic layer can ideally 
follow the external field without interfer-
ence (free layer). The resistance is then 
minimal if the magnetizations of the two 
layers are aligned in parallel and is in-
creased by approximately 5 % if the mag-
netizations are aligned antiparallel. The 
interaction of the reference magnetization 
with the external field may be minimized 
with the help of a synthetic antiferromag-
net (SAF), comprising two ferromagnetic 
layers, that are strongly antiferromag-
netically coupled by means of very thin 
nonmagnetic interlayer (Fig. 10). This sig-
nificantly increases the robustness against 
interference fields. 

Figure 11 shows a typical characteristic 
curve for a spin valve. The two charac-
teristic states for the two opposing direc-
tions of the external magnetic field can 
clearly be distinguished. The spin valve is 
sensitive to field strength changes in the 
transitional range between high and low 
resistance.

The maximum signal amplitude for a gradi-
ometer sensor then results when the direc-
tion of the field at the two bridge locations 
is precisely 180° phase-shifted. This is the 
case on a multipole wheel, for instance,  
if the distance between the resistance ele-
ments corresponds to the distance between 
poles in the multipole ring (Fig. 13).

Absolute rotating-speed measurement
Measuring principle of the oscillation 
 gyroscope
Basic principles
Mechanical gyroscopes (gyros for short) 
utilize inertial forces in precisely measur-
ing angular movements in space indepen-
dent of the reference system. Notwith-
standing their pronounced measuring ef-
fect, rotating gyroscopes as well as optical 
sensors based on the interferometric 
 Sagnac effect (laser and fiber gyroscopes), 

are out of the question for automotive ap-
plications due to the high costs involved. 

On the other hand, the slightly less-severe 
requirements on precision for applications 
in the motor vehicle can be complied with 
by gyroscopes manufactured using fine-
mechanical and micromechanical pro-
cesses. Instead of a rotational movement, 
these units use an equivalent, elastic, os-
cillatory movement to generate the mea-
suring effect. In principle, these sensors 
are similar to mechanical gyroscopes. 
They exploit the Coriolis accelerations 
which are generated when rotary motions 
are coupled with an oscillatory component 
(velocity v) (Fig. 14). These sensors are 
known as oscillation gyroscopes and are 
used in the electronic stability program 
(ESP) for the detection of the vehicle 
breaking away, in navigation systems for 
the detection of the direction of travel and 
in cameras to stabilize the image against 
wobbling. They also comply adequately with 
all automotive stipulations such as freedom 
from maintenance, long service life, switch-
on time constant etc., not to forget the ques-
tion of costs.

Oscillation gyroscopes measure the  
yaw rate around their “sensitive” axis.  
The yaw rate Vz around the vehicle’s 
 vertical axis (yaw axis) is measured in

the electronic stability program (ESP) and 
in the navigation system. Systems for trig-
gering rollover protection systems need 
data on the yaw rates Vx and Vy around the 
vehicle’s pitch and roll axes. 

Measurement of the Coriolis acceleration
Oscillation gyroscopes measure the 
 Coriolis acceleration in the following 
way: as the distance between a mass and 
the axis of rotation increases, the mass 
must cover a greater distance in the time 
of one revolution because of the greater 
radius. Circumference increases with the 
radius. The mass must, therefore, acquire 
a higher tangential speed and must be 
accelerated to achieve this. This acceler-
ation (Coriolis acceleration) is measured 
by suspending the mass on springs and 
measuring the bend in the suspension.  
If the distance of the mass, now rotating 
at a higher tangential speed, from the 
axis of rotation is now reduced, the mass 
must now become slower, as it needs 
only cover a shorter distance for each 
revolution. The braking deceleration re-
quired is also measured via the bend of 
the suspension. 

In the oscillation gyroscopes, the dis-
tance of one (or more) masses from the 
axis of rotation is periodically increased 
and then reduced again by an oscillation 
excitation (Fig. 14, movement in the y di-
rection). This means that the mass must be 
accelerated and then braked again in the 
same cycle (movement in the x direction). 
The forces necessary for this depend on 
the amplitude of the exciting oscillation 
and the current yaw rate. If the exciting 
 oscillation is kept constant, the yaw rate V 
can be determined from the acceleration 
forces. 

The Coriolis force acts in accordance with 
a known vector law perpendicular to the 
rotary motion and speed of the mass in 
motion (Fig. 14). This gives the Coriolis 
 acceleration as:
(1)  

aCoriolis = ax = 2?vy?x?Vz

Whereby, the velocity vy changes sinusoi-
dally in accordance with the oscillatory 
movement: 
(2) 

vy = vy?sinvt

This means that, at a constant yaw rate Vz, 
a sinusoidal Coriolis acceleration aCoriolis of 
the same frequency is measured. The am-
plitude is then:
(3)  

aCoriolis = 2?vy?Vz

The acceleration ay which is also applied 
to the mass m in the oscillatory direction is 
usually several orders of magnitude higher 
than the useful Coriolis acceleration. 
(4) 

ay = dvy/dt  = v?vy?cosvt

As the Coriolis acceleration has the same 
frequency as the exciting function, the use-
ful signal (the yaw rate) can be obtained by 
multiplication of the exciting signal and 
the Coriolis signal with subsequent averag-
ing (phase-correct rectification). Interfer-
ence signals of other frequencies are fil-
tered out (principle of the lock-in ampli-
fier). Averaging (with a low-pass filter) 
frees the output signal from the excitation 
frequency. An output voltage is generated 
which is proportional to the yaw rate:
UA = const ?aCoriolis = const'?V

Measuring principles
Acceleration sensors measure the force F 
executed on an inert mass m by an acceler-
ation a:

(1)  

F = m?a

Here, just as in force measurement, sys-
tems are available to measure displace-
ment as well as mechanical strain.

Displacement or travel-measuring systems
In the case of travel-measuring systems 
(Fig. 1), a mass m – the seismic mass – is 
elastically attached to the body, the accel-
eration a of which it is intended to mea-
sure. 

Constant acceleration
In the event of a constant acceleration, the 
acceleration force is in equilibrium with 
the return force applied to the spring with 
spring constant c deflected by x:

(2) 

F = m?a = c?x

The system’s measurement sensitivity S is 
therefore:

S = x/a = m/c

This indicates that a large mass together 
with low spring stiffness result in high 
measurement sensitivity.

Variable acceleration
In the dynamic case, a damping force and 
an inertia force are to be taken into consid-
eration in addition to the spring force. The 
essential damping force is proportional to 
.
the velocity x
damping coefficient p. The inertia force is 
..
proportional to the acceleration x
. The re-
sulting equation (4) describes a resonant 
system: 

 and is described using the 

(4)  

.
F = m?a = c?x + p?x

..
 + m?x

 

Assuming negligible damping (p ≈ 0), this 
system has a resonant frequency of:
____
v0 = √   c
  m

 
(5)  
 

 

This means that in accordance with equa-
tion (3), the measuring sensitivity S is di-
rectly linked to the resonant frequency  
v0 in the following manner:

(6)  

v0

2?S = 1

In other words, sensitivity can be expected 
to be reduced by factor 1/4 when the reso-
nant frequency is doubled. It is only 
clearly below their resonant frequency 
that such spring-mass systems display ad-
equate proportionality between measured 
variable and deflection.

Electrical  

Principle

pick-off

The resulting excursion is converted into 
an electrical signal by a suitable measuring 
technique (cf. Table 2).

Position control
Travel measuring systems allow the appli-
cation of the compensation principle, in 
which the system deflection due to accel-
eration is controlled out by an equivalent 
return force (Fig. 1b). The sensor element 
is now a component part of a closed con-
trol loop. The return force or the variable 
generating it (e.g. current or voltage) acts 
as a measure of the acceleration. The sys-
tem operates through closed-loop control 
very close to the zero point of the excursion 
and achieves a high degree of linearity. 

Closed loop position control produces  
a greater measuring range, which is only 
limited by the return force and a higher 
cutoff frequency than similar, non-motion-
controlled systems (Fig. 1a).

Damping
To prevent an excessive resonance, which 
would cause interference, pure deflection 
systems demand defined damping that is 
independent of the temperature. If the 
damping coefficient p is related to the 
other parameters in equation (4), this 
 results in Lehr’s damping factor D:

This dimensionless variable permits a sim-
ple description and comparison of differ-
ing resonant systems. Natural vibration 
and increase in resonance sharpness are 
largely determined by this damping factor. 
Values of D = 0.5 to 0.7 are preferred in 
practice (Fig. 2).

In the case of position-controlled sys-

tems, damping is implemented and ad-
justed in the closed control loop.

chanics. Because of the capacitive evalua-
tion, the measurement signal is deter-
mined only by the geometry and stable 
material parameters and is barely influ-
enced by variables such as temperature. 
The very small measuring capacities of 
these sensors, however, requires that eval-
uation electronics are provided in the im-
mediate vicinity.

The advantage of surface micromechan-
ics is the opportunity it provides to control 
by position or to deflect the systems by ap-
plying electrostatic forces (to the measur-
ing electrodes or to an additionally fitted 
electrode set). The latter, being a genuine 
electro-mechanical self test, is an effective 
means of checking the entire signal path.

Applications
Piezoelectric sensors are only used in the 
motor vehicle in acceleration and yaw-rate 
sensors. 

Longitudinal effect principle of action
Under the action of a force F, piezoelectric 
materials generate a charge Q on their sur-
faces to which electrodes are attached 
(Fig. 3). This charge is proportional to the 
mechanical stress generated by the force F.

Materials for piezoelectric components 
can be broadly classified into monocrys-
tals, such as quartz, and ceramics.

Piezoelectrically active ceramics are pro-
duced by sintering finely ground ferroelec-
tric materials. These ceramics then consist 
of very many small crystals randomly ori-
ented in space. These are then polarized in 
production by the application of a high 
electric field strength. This largely aligns 
the randomly oriented polarizations of the 
microcrystals.

Depolarization, with the consequent loss 

of the piezoelectric properties, can be 
caused in piezoceramics by temperatures 
above the Curie temperature, by intensive 
mechanical stresses or by polarization with 
opposite field strengths. 

The charges generated are discharged 
through the external resistance of the mea-
suring circuit or through the piezo sensor’s 
internal resistance. Such sensors cannot 
measure statically, and are only used where 
dynamic measurement is needed. The typi-
cal limit frequencies of this high pass re-
sponse, however, lie above 1 Hz, depending 
on the application.

Transverse effect and shear effect
In addition to the longitudinal piezoelec-
tric effect (Fig. 3a), there are also trans-
verse and shear effects (Figs. 3b and 3c).  

In practice, these effects occur together. 
The relationship between the charge gen-
erated and the mechanical stress acting 
can thus be formulated as a tensor equation. 
The transverse effect is used for exam-
ple in a bimorph. These are composed of 
two oppositely polarized piezoceramics 
used for the measurement of bending 
stresses (Fig. 4). When the two-layer 
 ceramic composite bends, one half is 
stretched (« > 0) and the other compressed 
(« < 0). The opposed-polarity of the ce-
ramic plates means that the resulting part 
voltages U1 and U2 now add to form a total 
voltage U which can be picked off on the 
two outside metal layers. 

Electrical signal evaluation
Piezoelectric sensor elements may be 
modeled as a voltage supply with a capaci-
tive internal resistance. The internal resis-
tance is infinitely high for ideal elements. 
Signal processing must be rated with cor-
responding care. 

There are two options for matching the 

impedance to subsequent systems:

however contribute to the transmission 
function. 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Charge amplifier (Fig. 5b): here the 

charge is stored on a second capacitor. 
Parasitic capacitances have no influence. 

In both cases, resistors parallel to the sen-
sor element must be taken into consider-
ation for the transfer function. 

Thermal acceleration sensors
Thermal acceleration sensors generate  
a “bubble of heated gas” over a heater 
 element. The tight heated gas space has  
a lighter density than the surrounding, 
cooler gas. In the event of a lateral acceler-
ation, the low density area of gas is dis-
placed within the surrounding, cooler gas. 
The ensuing asymmetry is detected by 
thermocouples or resistors as a bridge 
 circuit. The bridge voltage represents  
the acceleration signal.

6 Principle of thermal acceleration sensors

Packaging
A packaging which is tailor made to suit 
each individual application plays a deci-
sive role for the quality of the sensor. Ac-
celeration sensors detect the measured 
variable without a movable connection to 
the outside world, it is no problem to en-
capsulate them hermetically. A rigid me-
chanical coupling to the body to be mea-
sured must, however, be achieved, as addi-
tional elastic or loose elements could lead 
to falsification of the measurement. On the 
other hand, this fixed coupling must not 
lead to thermal expansion which may 
 occur at the structure being transferred  
to the sensor so that measurements are 
 falsified.

Measuring principles
Pressure as a measured variable is a non-
directional force acting in all directions 
which occurs in gases and liquids. It is 
propagated in liquids, and also very well  
in gel-like substances and soft sealing 
compounds. There are static and dynamic 
measuring sensors for the measurement  
of these pressures. 

The dynamic pressure sensors include 
for instance all microphones which, since 
they are insensitive to static pressures, are 
used to measure pressure pulsations in 
gaseous and/or liquid media. Since up to 
now, practically only static pressure sen-
sors have been used in automotive engi-
neering, these will be dealt with in more 
detail here.

Direct pressure measurement
Given that all known resistors are more or 
less pressure-dependent (volumetric ef-
fect), when very high pressures (>104 bar) 
are to be measured it would suffice to sim-
ply subject an electrical resistor to the 
pressure medium (Fig. 1a). On the other 
hand, they are at the same time more or 
less temperature-dependent, a character-
istic which is usually very difficult to sup-
press. Furthermore, the sealed lead-out  
of their connections from the pressure 
 medium presents difficulties.

 exposed on one side to the pressure to be 
measured and which deflects to a greater or 
lesser degree as a function of the pressure. 
Within a very wide range, its diameter and 
thickness can be adapted to the particular 
pressure range. Low-pressure measuring 
ranges lead to relatively large diaphragms 
which can easily deform in the range 1 to  
0.1 mm. Higher pressures though demand 
thicker, small-diameter diaphragms which 
generally only deform by a few µm. 

In case (capacitive) pick-offs for spacing 

or distance measurements are also re-
quired, voltage-measuring methods domi-
nate in the medium-pressure to high-pres-
sure ranges. Here, practically only strain 
gage techniques are used.

Capacitive pick-off
In contrast to their application in inertia 
sensors (see acceleration/yaw-rate sen-
sors), capacitive pressure sensors are still 
only rarely encountered even though they 
could possibly provide similar advantages 
(particularly with respect to their accu-
racy). This is more than likely the result of 
one important difference compared to the 
other sensors referred to above: pressure 
sensors need a direct contact with the 
monitored medium. The dielectric charac-
teristics of which practically always affect 
the calibration of such capacitive pressure 
sensors. This means that the calibration 
would then not only be dependent upon 
the medium in question, but would also be 
impossible without it (that is, in the “dry” 
state). Clear separation of the sensor from 
the monitored medium has up to now only 
been achieved at the cost of considerable 
technical outlay.

Strain gage pick-off
The elongations of the diaphragm occur-
ring on the deflection of a diaphragm-type 
sensor are detected using strain-gage 
technology (strain-gage strips or strain-
gage resistors). Strain-gage resistors are 
affixed to the diaphragm (e.g. vapor-
 deposited). Their electrical resistance 

 varies under the influence of mechanical 
stresses. The resistors are connected 
 together to form a Wheatstone bridge. 
Its voltage is a measure for the pressure. 

Table 1 presents a systematic overview 
of the proven pressure-measurement tech-
niques which to a great extent have al-
ready been used in automotive applica-
tions. The list is arranged according to  
the type of diaphragm material and the 
 applied strain gage technology. The combi-
nations have been marked to indicate ei-
ther those which are already actually in 
production and which will be described as 
actual examples in the “sensor designs” 
chapter (x), or those which are already

With regard to the particular measuring 
 effect’s magnitude and type, the strain-gage 
techniques listed above have widely vary-
ing characteristics. The gage factor (K) de-
fines the magnitude of the measuring effect 
of strain-gage resistors. It gives the relative 
change in such a resistor’s resistance R re-
ferred to the relative change in its length l 
(equation 1):

n is the material’s Poisson ratio, r repre-
senting its electric conductivity. n charac-
terizes the reduction in cross-section of the 
material on elongation and, in the ideal-
ized case of a volume being kept constant, 
amounts to n = 0.5 (in reality n = 0.3 to 0.4).
Whereas the conductivity term in equa-

tion 1 is of hardly any importance in the 
case of metallic resistors, with regard to  
Si resistors it plays a dominant role. 

One refers to a longitudinal K factor when 
the resistor is expanded in the current di-
rection and to a transverse K factor when 
it is expanded transverse to the current di-
rection (Fig. 2). Table 2 provides an over-
view of typical values for the most impor-
tant gage factors. 

“Creep” (slight mechanical give under 
the effects of long-term unidirectional load-
ing) is a highly-feared phenomenon which,

Transfer to a force sensor
Instead of directly using the force taken  
up by their diaphragm, a number of sen-
sors transfer it to a force sensor whose 
measurement range can remain constant 
due to the fact that the purely mechanical 
diaphragm has already performed the 
 adaptation to the pressure-measuring 
range. Perfect linkage from measuring 
 diaphragm to force sensor (for instance  
by a tappet) must be ensured though.

In many cases, initial developments failed 
to lead to the expected results since gener-
ally the costs involved in achieving the 
stipulated accuracy were excessive for  
the systems in which the sensors were to 
be installed. Contrary to expectations, it 
proved impossible to force down the costs 
for the production of good torque sensors 
below those for pressure and acceleration 
sensors. In fact the torque sensors cost 
more. Matters are aggravated, and this ap-
plies particularly to torque sensors, when 
the measured variable has to be trans-
ferred using non-contact methods from  
a rotating shaft (e.g. steering spindle or 
drive shaft) to a sensor mounted on the 
chassis. Collector rings are not acceptable 
for the motor vehicle.

Since any form of measurement of only 
part of the force or torque is very prob-
lematical and can easily lead to false re-
sults, force and torque sensors must be 
 directly connected into the power flux  
(in other words, the complete measured 
variable must pass through them). Sensors 
that measure force are extensive sensors, 
in other words, their size depends directly  
on the measuring range.

Although, in line with automotive-indus-
try demands, there are compact force and 
torque sensors on the market, these only 
measure accurately enough when the 
forces are introduced to the sensor in a 
precisely defined manner, a stipulation 
that normally can only be complied with 
under laboratory conditions. The toler-
ances and misalignment normally encoun-
tered in practice generally dictate the con-
nection of homogenization elements which 
in turn then lead to the sensors becoming 
too large.

If force and torque-transfer components 

must be cut in order for previously test-
able sensors to be fitted, this generally re-
sults in an interface problem. This can only 
be solved by close cooperation between 
the sensor supplier and the various suppli-
ers of the parts (or vehicle manufacturer) 
which must be cut in order to install the 
sensors. Up to now, this problem has not 
been encountered with other sensor types, 
at least not with this severity and with such 
wide-ranging implications.

Even if the force and torque-transfer 
components do not have to be cut, and me-
chanical elements are used as measuring 
springs which only need modifying for in-
stallation of the sensor elements, very pre-
cise alignment is still necessary.

Even though hardly any series produc-
tion force and travel sensors are currently 
available from Bosch for the motor vehicle, 
there follows a brief overview of the most 
important measuring principles and pro-
posed developments that have made it to 
the shortlist.

216     Sensor measuring principles  |  Force and torque sensors

Measuring principles
Basically speaking, when considering 
force and torque measurement, a differ-
ence must be made between static and dy-
namic measuring principles, and between 
measuring principles based on displace-
ment and mechanical strain. Past require-
ments were predominantly for static sen-
sors, and in the case of force sensors, 
 generally non-resilient strain-measuring 
principles were preferred. “Soft”, resilient 
sensor systems are only accepted for 
torque sensors, particularly in the current 
example of steering-wheel torque sensing, 
which can also be implemented using an-
gle-measurement pick-offs. This is possi-
ble, particularly because this characteris-
tic proved to be tolerable in earlier hy-
draulic systems which were not equipped 
with sensors. The use of magnetically ac-
tive coil systems previously dominated 
both sectors, force and torque sensing,  
in automotive and industrial uses.

More recently, however, displacement 

measuring magnetostatic sensors (Hall 
sensors) are being used here, too, to allow 
the application of micro-structured ele-
ments manufactured in series production 
(e.g. measurement of the passenger’s 
weight) and, despite the familiar problems 
with dirt and the complexity of their instal-
lation, optoelectronic pick-offs are also

 being considered (e.g. for electronic 
power- assisted steering systems), which 
simultaneously permit torque measure-
ment and high-resolution angle of rotation 
measurement.

Strain measuring force sensors
Magnetoelastic principle
Under the influence of a magnetic field, 
ferromagnetic materials change their 
length in the direction of the field (magne-
tostriction effect). The length can either 
 increase (positive magnetostriction) or re-
duce (negative magnetostriction) here de-
pending on the material, for the same field 
direction. The inversion of this effect, the 
change in the magnetic characteristics un-
der the effect of tensile and compressive 
stresses, or elongation and compression,  
is known as the magnetoelastic effect.  
This effect is expressed in an anisotropic 
(directional) behavior of relative magnetic 
permeability mr (relationship between 
magnetic induction B and magnetic field 
strength H). If this still has the same value 
in all directions (isotropic) in a force-free 
situation, it takes on a somewhat different 
value (mrl) in the direction of the force un-
der the influence of a force F introduced 
than that transverse to it (mrq) (Fig. 1). The 
effect is not only observed on crystalline 
or polycrystalline materials, but also in 
amorphous substances.

In fact, the permeability change in the 
direction of force is a true reflection of the 
sign of the force. Even though practically 
all ferromagnetic materials demonstrate 
this effect, it can be optimized by using a 
specific alloy composition. Unfortunately 
though, the materials which have good lin-
earity, low hysteresis, and low temperature 
sensitivity, are not identical with the ones 
which have a high measuring effect. 
Whereas the maximum measuring effects 
observed up to the present are about 30 % 
(referred to the fundamental isotropic val-
ues), and can be utilized without electron-
ics being necessary, the effect displayed by 
materials which have been optimized from

the point of view of measurement tech-
niques is only in an area of a few percent 
and needs electronic amplification.

The advantages of the magnetoelastic 
effect are to be found in its broad tempera-
ture range and the fact that technical ap-
plications are possible up to temperatures 
as high as approximately 300 °C. On the 
other hand, it represents a marked volume 
effect. This means that the coils used for 
detection not only register a local variation 
of permeability (as with a strain gage, for 
instance) caused by the application of force, 
but more or less the effects throughout  
the whole of the coil’s cross section. This 
makes the sensor somewhat less sensitive 
to the possibility of force being applied 
asymmetrically.

Since the changes in permeability as a 
function of applied force are practically 
 always registered with the help of alter-
nating fields, the penetration depth of 
these fields, which is highly frequency-
 dependent, must be observed: 

Only those mechanical forces can con-
tribute to the measuring effect which are 
present in the measuring field’s effective 
penetration depth. In order to be able to 
put the measuring effect to maximum use, 
the magnetically active air gap should be 

kept as small as possible. Often, this means 
that the magnetically active measuring cir-
cuit is closed with ferromagnetic material, 
even when this is not included in the 
power flux.

Figure 2 shows the two most important 

possibilities of evaluating the magneto-
elastic effect: If a coil is arranged on the 
measurement structure so that its direc-
tion of field coincides with the direction of 
applied force, the change in inductance L 
can be picked-off and applied directly. In-
dependent of the magnitude of the applied 
force, the excitation field strength H and 
the induction B always have the same di-
rection (Fig. 2a). 

If the field strength H of the supply coil 
is not axially parallel to the applied force, 
the effect of the latter not only changes the 
magnetic induction B, but also its direction 
(due to the anisotropy of the permeability, 
Fig. 2b). Assuming that with no force ap-
plied the directions of H and B are super-
posed one upon the other in the normal 
manner, these assume increasingly differ-
ent directions when force is applied and 
increased. This can be exploited particu-
larly advantageously in the variation of the 
magnetic coupling of two coils affixed at 
90° to one another (Kreuzduktor) (Fig. 3).

Strain gage principle (piezoresistive)
Strain-gage measuring resistors (strain-
gage strips) represent the most wide-
spread and probably the most reliable and 
precise method for measuring force and 
torque (Fig. 4). Their principle is based  
on the fact that in the zone of the elastic-
member material to which Hooke’s Law 
applies there is a proportional relationship 
between the mechanical strain s in the 
member, caused by the introduction of 
force, and the resulting elongation «. In 
this case, in accordance with Hooke’s law:

(1) 

« = Dl/l = s/E

whereby the proportionality constant E is 
the modulus of elasticity. Since it does not 
directly measure the strain resulting from 
the applied force, but rather the – locally – 
resulting elongation, the strain-gage 
method can be regarded as an indirect 
measuring method. For instance, if the 
modulus of elasticity decreases by 3 % 
above 100 K, a figure which is normal for 
metals, then the force indicated by the 
strain-gage method is 3 % too high. 

Strain-gage resistors in the form of film 
resistors – by contrast with cemented-on 
strain gages – are so closely bonded to the 

surface of the selected elastic member that 
they follow its surface elongation perfectly. 
The change in resistance resulting from 
the resistor’s elongation is defined by the 
particular gage factor K of the resistor in 
question (refer to “pressure sensors”):

(2) 

DR/R = K?«

The K factor generally does not exceed a 
value of 2 for metal-film resistors, but is 
generally somewhat below this in practice. 
Strain gages are designed such that they 
(in conjunction with a specific elongating 
material (substrate) and their thermal 
elongation) have no inherent temperature 
sensitivity where possible (TCR ≈ 0). Any 
residual temperature sensitivity is usually 
eliminated by depositing the resistors on 
the elastic member in the form of a half  
or full bridge. Since temperature effects 
result in same-direction changes on the 
strain gage this results in no output signal.
The auxiliary bridge resistors can be (but 
need not be) located within the elastic mem-
ber’s elongation zone. They can also be 
 fitted as purely compensation resistors 
(Fig. 4c). It must be noted that often the  
K factor itself also has a temperature coef-
ficient (TCK). Usually, this decreases along

with increasing temperature, which means 
that in favorable cases it can compensate 
for the signal increase caused by the mod-
ulus of elasticity. Apart from this, signal 
reductions caused by the K factor are usu-
ally compensated for by a bridge supply 
voltage U0 which increases accordingly.

In addition to the longitudinal K factor Kl 
 described above, there is also the transverse 
K factor Kt, which must then be applied if the 
direction of strain is transverse to the cur-
rent flow. It has an inverse sign (negative) 
and is no greater than 0.5 in value.

Disadvantages/limitations:
Notwithstanding their high levels of accu-
racy and reliability, since the elongations 
and therefore also the changes in resis-
tance (at least in the case of metal film re-
sistors) are only in the percentage range  
of the original state, the strain-gage sen-
sors only generate output signals in the 
mV range so that in general local amplifi-
cation is required. A further disadvantage 
of small strain-gage sensors is the fact  
that they measure precisely the strain

(and only this strain) at the point at which 
it is applied. This, of course, no longer 
holds true in cases in which the strain-
gage structure is distributed across the 
elastic member’s complete surface. This 
necessitates extremely precise and repro-
ducible application of the force to be mea-
sured if measuring errors due to uneven 
force introduction are to be avoided.

Application:
As a rule, in order to carry out force mea-
surements, very small strain-gage resistors 
must be attached to larger force-carrying 
parts or elastic members. The traditional 
method of applying the strain-gage resis-
tors to the elastic member by means of a 
foil backing (as applied in such devices as 
high-precision scales), is not inexpensive 
enough for large-batch “low-cost” produc-
tion. First attempts are therefore being 
made to apply low-cost, large batch film/
layer techniques by depositing the strain-
gage resistors on small metal wafers which 
are then pressed into, or welded onto the 
elastic element.

Orthogonally printed resistors
Practically all electrical film resistors 
change their resistance not only under the 
influence of laterally applied deformation 
strain but also when compression is ap-
plied vertical to the film plane (orthogo-
nal). Here, the so-called “conductive plas-
tic”, commonly used in potentiometers, 
features very high sensitivity. “Cermet” 
and “carbon layers” are also highly sensi-
tive (Fig. 5). Up to a certain limit, the resis-
tance of the above materials decreases 
along with increasing compression. The 
values that can be achieved without per-
manent resistance change are similar to 
those which apply for lateral elongation.  
In both cases, the limit is a function of 
 substrate strength and not of the resis-
tance material. Of course, sensors of this 
type are almost only suitable for loading 
by compression but not by lateral strain.

Travel measuring force sensors
The question of whether an integrated 
travel-measuring weight sensor still has a 
little additional elasticity or not is not im-
portant when it is built into seats for motor 
vehicle occupants, which are anyway sus-
pended.

This principle is used in the iBolt™ force 

sensor (see sensor types). Four of these 
sensors are built into the frame of the front 
passenger seat for measuring the weight  
of the passenger. This makes it possible  
to modify the triggering of the airbag.

Torque sensors
A fundamental distinction is made in 
torque measurement, too, between meth-
ods using angle or strain measurement.  
In contrast to strain-measurement meth-
ods (strain-gage resistors, magnetoelastic), 
angle-measurement methods (e.g. eddy 

6 Torque measurement: basic principle

current) require a certain length l of the 
torsion shaft via which the torsion angle 
(approximately 0.4 to 4°) can be picked-off. 
The mechanical stress s proportional to 
the torque is aligned at an angle of less 
than 45° to the shaft axis (Fig. 6).

The principles described below are all 
suited for the non-contacting (proximity) 
transfer of measured values, even from ro-
tating shafts. In the case of steering-torque 
measurement, it is also desirable for the 
employed measuring system to measure  
the steering angle very accurately (through 
a full rotation of 360°). This is in the sense 
of modular integration and is to be imple-
mented with only slight modification.

Strain-measuring sensors
Even though magnetoelastic sensors which 
enclose the shaft are available on the mar-
ket, these involve very high costs. Since it 
is often impossible to optimize the shaft 
material with regard to its magnetoelastic 
properties, a search is being made for 
methods to coat the measuring shaft with  
a magnetoelastic layer. Such a coating, 
which has to exhibit good measuring quali-
ties, has still not been found.

This is why the strain gage principle has 
become predominant (Fig. 7): a strain-gage 
bridge measures the mechanical stress. 
The bridge is powered using transformer 
principles (by a rectifier and control-elec-
tronics circuitry on the shaft, independent 
of the air gap). Further local electronic 
components on the shaft permit the mea-
surement signal to be amplified and con-
verted to an AC form which is independent 
of the air gap (for instance, frequency-ana-
log) which can then also be outputted us-
ing transformer principles. 

When large-batch quantities are in-

volved, the electronic circuitry on the shaft 
can be integrated in a single chip without 
problems. The strain-gage resistor can be 
inexpensively formed on a prefabricated 
round steel plate (for instance, using thin-
film techniques) which is then welded to 
the shaft. The two ring transformers re-

quired for power and signal transmission 
can be manufactured at an extremely  
low cost from a soft-magnetic molding 
compound. High precision levels can be 
achieved with such a configuration in  
spite of reasonable manufacturing costs.

Angle-measuring (torsion-measuring) sensors
Sensors for measuring angular difference
It is a relatively easy matter to determine 
the torsion angle when two mutually-inde-
pendent incremental speed sensors, or an 
absolute-measuring (analog or digital) 
non-contacting angular-movement pick-
off, are provided at each end of the 
section of the shaft subject to torsion  
(L ≈ 5 to 10 cm) (Fig. 8). The difference 
in their outputs w2 - w1 is a measure for 
the torsion angle:

(3) 
 
 

M = const?L?(w2 - w1)
where L =  length of the 

section subject  
to torsion

Up to now, since adequate accuracy de-
mands extremely precise bearings, to-
gether with the necessity to provide corre-
spondingly accurate angular or incremental 
subdivision around the complete periph-
ery, this method has been regarded as too 
complicated. Nevertheless work is forcing 
ahead with solving this problem (magneti-
cally or optically), because such a system 
would incorporate two distinct advantages:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Possibility of simultaneous measure-
ment of the angle of rotation with the 
same system

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Possibility of measurement without far-
reaching modifications to the torsion 
shaft being necessary, so that essentially 
the sensor could be in the form of a 
plug-in sensor providing an efficient 
 interface for a supplier component

The angle may be measured with high 
 precision using the vernier principle, for 
example: this is done by marking the cir-
cumference of the shaft with a sinusoidal 
track, of which an integer number of  
N  cycles fits in one circumference.

By contrast with a pure incremental track, 
which would permit only a resolution of an 
N-th of the circumference, this sinusoidal 
signal structure, however, theoretically 
permits as fine a resolution per circumfer-
ence as is required by the application of 
the arcsin function within a single sine 
 cycle. This fine resolution is, however,  
only useful if it is always known in which 
of the N similar cycles one is located.

The unambiguity can easily be created  

if a second track with a little less spatial 
frequency in which only N-1 sine cycles  
fit on the circumference is applied around 
the circumference. Although the two sig-
nals do not supply an unambiguous signal 
for an angle-of-rotation measurement,  
it is, however, possible to draw firm con-
clusions from the phase difference Dw be-
tween the two signals, in which sine cycle 
one is currently located. The pitch differ-
ence between the two signals varies over 
the entire circumference by precisely 360°. 
Figure 10 shows an example with N = 10.  
If the phase difference between the two 
signals is, for instance, in the range be-
tween 36° and 72°, then one is clearly lo-

cated in the second sine cycle. If the value 
is between 216° and 252°, one is located  
in the 6th cycle. The precise measuring 
 angle w is then formed by adding another 
angle, in the first case of 360° and in the 
second case of 216° to the measured, but 
not unambiguous fine signal w.
In practice however, the arcsin function 
is not used to resolve the individual sine 
cycles finely, as it would be necessary to 
guarantee a constant and normalized sig-
nal amplitude for this. It is rather the case 
that a second, cosine-wave track, phase-
shifted against the first by precisely 90°, 
is applied next to the sine-wave marking. 
Because of the spatial vicinity, it may be 
assumed that both tracks are sensed with 
the same amplitude u, so that the angle w 
within the sine cycle can be determined by 
the arctan function from the two individual 
signals u1 and u2 independently of u:

must be precisely manufactured and as-
sembled in order to achieve the stipulated 
accuracy. The associated electronics are 
appropriately accommodated very near  
to the coils.

Although this sensor principle was de-
veloped at Bosch for motor vehicle appli-
cations, it was only used in electric power 
tools (torque sensing in industrial power

has further developed this, very cost-ef-
fective, sensor principle for motor vehicle 
applications to product maturity.

Thus a total of four tracks are required for

ing-angle sensor illustrated in Figure 9 thus 
requires a total of eight tracks, which are 
read optoelectronically, to measure two 
 angles w1 and w2. Its angular precision over 
360° is 1°, the angular resolution is 0.0055°, 
the resolution of the difference angle Dw is 
0.0044° with a measuring range of + 9°.

 

Eddy-current sensors 
Two slotted sleeves of electrically con-
ducting aluminum are attached to each 
end of a sufficiently long section of the 
measuring shaft. These are inserted one 
inside the other (Fig. 11). Each sleeve is 
provided with two rows of slots so that 
when the shaft is twisted, it becomes in-
creasingly visible through one row of slots, 
and is hidden more and more by the other 
row. This leads to increasing, or decreas-
ing, damping of the two high-frequency 
coils (approx. 1 MHz) situated above each 
row of slots so that coil inductance also 
varies accordingly. The slotted sleeves

Flowmeters 

Measured variables
The purpose of flow measurement in the 
motor vehicle is the detection of the intake 
air flow rate. This air flow rate must be 
known precisely so that the engine-man-
agement system – both in diesel and in 
gasoline engines – can set a defined air-
fuel mixture. This value can be determined 
by a flowmeter. The sensors which are 
used for measuring air flow rate or gas 
flows in general are also referred to as 
 “anemometers”.

As such, the often-used term “air quan-
tity” is incorrect because it does not stipu-
late whether volume or mass is concerned. 
Since the chemical processes involved in 
fuel combustion are clearly based on mass 
relationships, the object of the measure-
ment is the mass of intake air. On gasoline 
engines, the air-mass flow rate is the most 
important load parameter. In diesel en-
gines, the exhaust-gas recirculation rate  
is regulated using the air-mass flow. 

Depending upon engine power, the aver-

age (over time) maximum air-mass flow 
rate to be measured is between 400 and 
1,200 kg/h. Due to the low air require-
ments at engine idle in modern gasoline 
engines, the ratio of minimum to maximum

flow is 1:50 to 1:100. Because of the higher 
idle air demand in diesel engines, these 
 ratios must be assumed to be 1:20 to 1:40. 
The severe exhaust gas and fuel-consump-
tion requirements dictate accuracies of  
2 to 3 % of the measured value. Referred  
to the measuring range, this can easily 
correspond to a measuring accuracy of 
2?10-4, which is unusually high for a motor 
vehicle.

The air though, is not drawn in continu-
ously by the engine, but rather in time with 
the opening of the intake valves. Particu-
larly with the throttle valve wide open 
(WOT) in gasoline engines, this leads to 
considerable pulsation of the air-mass 
flow, also at the measuring point which is 
always in the intake tract between air filter 
and throttle valve, or between air filter and 
turbocharger (Fig. 1). Intake-manifold res-
onance leads to the pulsation in the mani-
fold sometimes being so pronounced that 
brief return flows can occur. This applies 
in particular to 4-cylinder engines in 
which there is no overlap of the air-intake 
phases. An accurate flowmeter must be 
 capable of registering these return flows 
with the correct direction.

On a 4-cylinder engine, the pulsations 

are generated at twice the crankshaft 
speed. This means that they can easily be 
in the range 50 to 100 Hz. With a flowme-
ter featuring a linear characteristic curve 
and a narrower frequency bandwidth than 
above, it would suffice for it to follow the 
mean value of these rapidly fluctuating air 
flows. The mean value is in any case posi-
tive, so that the meter need not necessarily 
detect the correct sign. 

Practically all of the air-mass meters ac-
tually in use feature a characteristic curve 
which is far from linear, so that the mea-
surement signal must be linearized elec-
tronically before it can be evaluated. 
 Averaging before linearization can lead  
to significant dynamic errors (mean-value 
errors). This fact means that such air-mass 
meters must be sufficiently rapid in follow-
ing the pulsations which mostly have a

pronounced non-sinusoidal characteristic, 
and therefore also have a considerable 
harmonic content. This necessitates a 
bandwidth of about 1,000 Hz. Apart from 
this considerable bandwidth, the air-mass 
meters must also have a high switch-on 
time constant in order for them to be able 
to measure correctly during the engine 
starting phase.

As is the case in all flowmeters, those 
used in the motor vehicle are calibrated 
for flow through a pipe with a symmetrical 
flow profile. This means that a flow with a 
velocity vector v at practically any point of 
the flow cross-section of area A depends 
only on the radius to the central axis, and 
not on the angle at the circumference. The 
flow profile (laminar or turbulent, Fig. 2)  
is related to the Reynolds number Re:

Re = v?D/h   
where 
D  typical cross-section dimension and 
h  kinematic ductility of the medium.

The flow profiles illustrated by way of ex-
ample only establish themselves after the 
flow has been uniformly formed for some 
time. In the motor vehicle, a profile lying 

between the laminar and turbulent profiles 
illustrated will be established for the case 
of laminar flow – caused by the short in-
flow. The laminar or turbulent characteris-
tic of the flow profile depends on whether 
Re is below or above a value of approxi-
mately 1,200. 

A further important influencing factor is 
the degree of turbulence in the flow, which 
is determined by the aerodynamic design 
of the inflow to the flowmeter. If the lami-
nar-turbulent transition is within the mea-
suring range, marked irregularity of the 
characteristic curve can be expected at 
this point. As far as motor vehicle applica-
tions go, a purely turbulent flow (square 
profile: v = constr) cannot be assumed at 
the smallest air masses (gasoline engine 
idling). A careful design of the inflow, to 
achieve square profiles even in the event 
of laminar flow, is then necessary. 

Assuming a homogeneous density r, and 

assuming a square profile, the flow is sim-
ple to calculate as follows:

Whereas in measurement techniques, 
long, straight, advance and overshoot 
 sections of constant cross-section are 
 stipulated in order to guarantee a sym-
metrical profile, such conditions cannot  
be complied with in a vehicle’s cramped 
under-hood installation space. If pro-
nounced asymmetries occur, the flowme-
ter must be calibrated as a function of the 
actual installation conditions.

Measuring principles
Up to now, of the practically unlimited 
 variety of flowmeters on the market, only 
those which operate according to the im-
pact-pressure principle have come to the 
forefront for air-quantity measurement in 
the vehicle. This principle still depends 
upon mechanically moving parts, and in 
principle correction measures are still 
needed to compensate for density fluctua-
tions. 

Today, true air-mass meters applying 
thermal methods (hot-wire or hot-film air 
flowmeters) are used which can follow 
sudden flow changes without mechanically 
moving parts.

Variable orifice plates (sensor plates)
The calculation of the pressure drop across 
fixed orifice plates is based on two physical 
laws:

Continuity equation:

r?1?v1?A1 = r?2?v2?A2 = const

Bernoulli’s equation:

1 
 
p1 + ___ ?r1?v1
2 
 

1
2 = p2 + ___ ?r2?v2
2

2 = const

These laws are to be applied for two different 
measuring cross-sections A1 and A2 (Fig. 3). 
Assuming constant density r = r1 = r2, this 
results in the pressure drop:

 
Dp = QV

This pressure drop can be measured either 
directly with a differential-pressure sensor, 
or by means of the force acting against a 
so-called sensor plate. It should be noted 
here that impact-pressure gages of this 
type measure a flow value that corresponds 
neither to the volume flow rate nor to the 
mass flow rate, but to a geometrical mean 
value of the two:

Because of the square relationship to the 
flow rate, fixed orifice plates permit only a 
variation in measured variable of 1:10, as 
otherwise the accuracy of the differential 
pressure recording is no longer adequate 
and significant pressure losses would result 
which would lead to power losses in the en-
gine. When larger ranges are to be covered, 
several orifice plates must be used, or such 
versions which automatically adapt them-
selves to the measuring range by opening 
up a larger flow cross-section A2 in line with 
the impact pressure. 

With such variable, moving sensor 
plates it is an easy matter to increase the 
variation to 1:100. Here, the increasing 
air flow causes the sensor plate to be de-
flected (usually against a constant coun-
terforce) into an area whose cross-section 
is specifically shaped so that the resulting 
deflection/angle relationship complies 
with the desired characteristic. In other 
words,  linear for K-Jetronic and non-linear 
for L-Jetronic. The sensor plate’s (Fig. 4) 
setting is then a measure for the air flow 
which is in relationship to the impact pres-
sure defined above. 

The limit frequency for such sensors is 
typically approx. 10 Hz. Such sensor plates 
though are unable to follow the high pulsa-
tion frequencies which often occur. From 
the point of view of the pulsation, they can 
be regarded as fixed orifice plates with a 
square-law characteristic curve. Under 
certain load conditions this leads to con-
siderable mean-value errors which can 
only be compensated for roughly by the 
use of suitable software.

If the density r of the intake air changes 
because of temperature fluctuations or the 
altitude, the measurement signal here will 
only change by √
sensor and a barometric pressure sensor 
must also be used to determine the density 
fluctuation fully.

––r. An air-temperature 

Hot-wire/hot-film anemometers
When current IH flows through a thin wire 
with electrical resistance R, its tempera-
ture increases. If at the same time a me-
dium with density r flows across it at ve-
locity v, a balance is set up between the 
electrical power input Pel and the power PV 
drawn off by the air flow, whereby

Pel = IH

2?R = PV = c1?l?Dq

Here, the power drawn off by the air flow 
is proportional to the temperature differ-
ence Dq established and the coefficient of 
thermal conductivity l. The following ap-
plies in close approximation:

l = √

––––r?v

Although l is primarily a function of the 
mass flow QLM, with the static medium at 
standstill (v = 0), a certain heat loss takes 
place (convection) represented by the ad-
ditive constant c2. This results in the famil-
iar interrelationship between the heating 
current IH and the mass flow QLM.

2?R, 

With the supply of a constant heat IH
a temperature rise Dq decreasing recipro-
cally with the root of the air-mass flow QLM 
would establish itself. If, on the other 
hand, the heating current IH is controlled 
such that a constant temperature increase 
(for instance, Dq = 100 K) is maintained 
even when the flow rate increases, this will 
lead to a heating current which increases 
approximately with the fourth root of the 
mass flow, and at the same time serves as a 
measure for the mass flow. 

The advantage of such a control loop lies 

in the fact that the electrical heating resis-
tor always remains at the same tempera-
ture so that its heat content need not be 
changed by means of time-wasting heat 
transfer. In fact, with a 70 µm platinum 
wire for instance, it is possible to achieve 

228     Sensor measuring principles  |  Flowmeters

time constants in the 1 ms range for 
changes in air-flow rate. In cases where 
closed-loop control is not used the time 
constants would be 40 to 100 times higher. 

If the heater temperature were to be main-
tained constant simply by keeping its (tem-
perature-dependent) resistance constant, 
with constant mass flow and higher me-
dium temperature, this would result in a 
current drop and therefore a false mea-
surement. In practice, this error is avoided 
by using a bridge circuit containing a sec-
ond high-ohm compensation resistor RK of 
the same type (e.g. platinum). Here, the 
heating resistor is kept at a constant over-
temperature Dq compared to the medium 
(Fig. 5) by a control loop. In case of a sud-
den jump in the medium temperature, the 
sensor reacts with a long time constant 
since in this case the heat content of the 
hot wire must be changed. The heating 
current generates a control voltage UM 
proportional to the air-mass flow on a pre-
cision resistor (measuring resistor RM).
The heating resistors in the first air-
mass meters (hot-wire air-mass meters) 
used for automotive applications were of 
very fine platinum wire. This wire was 
stretched in trapezoidal form across the 
flow cross-section so that it was able to 

 average out any asymmetries in the flow 
profile (Fig. 6). Adequate service lives only 
became possible when the platinum wire 
was stabilized by alloy additives so that  
its resistance no longer changed due to 
 deposits and cracks on its surface. This 
meant though that the deposits on the hot 
wire had to be burned-off automatically 
(approximately 1,000 °C) following every 
 operating phase.

Notwithstanding a number of functional 
advantages, this sensor concept was far 
too costly. A thick-film version (HFM2 hot-
film air-mass meter) was able to combine 
all the resistors concerned with the mea-
surement on a single ceramic substrate. 
Due to the ceramic substrate’s consider-
able thermal capacity, it was difficult not to 
exceed the maximum permissible switch-
ing constants. Furthermore, a complicated 
saw cut had to be made to reduce the un-
desirable heat coupling between heating 
and compensation resistors. On the other 
hand though, this version permitted the 
burn-off process to be dispensed with since 
the special flow conditions no longer led to 
unwanted deposits.

In contrast to both its predecessor 
types, a further silicon-based microme-
chanical version (HFM5 and HFM6 hot-

this flowmeter must ensure that the partial 
flow it measures represents the same frac-
tion of the total flow throughout the whole 
measuring range. This precondition can be 
achieved by means of a flow rectifier (grill) 
built into the measuring pipe.

  HFM5 and HFM6 hot-film air-mass 

 meters for gasoline and diesel engine

film air-mass meters) fulfilled practically 
all  expectations. In particular, this version 
is able to measure in both flow directions 
with the correct sign (Fig. 7). This means 
that the brief return flows that occur as a 
result of pulsation no longer lead to mea-
suring errors (Fig. 8).

To this end, in addition to the heater 
control circuit used in the previous ver-
sions, a temperature sensor is located on 
each side of the heating resistor, in other 
words upstream and downstream. This 
principle is similar to the Thomas process 
often encountered in the literature. When 
there is no flow (QML = 0), each of these 
sensors indicates the same temperature. 
When flow starts though, since the up-
stream sensor is cooled by the medium, 
the higher the flow the higher the temper-
ature difference between the two resistors. 
The output signal derived from the tem-
perature difference has a similar charac-
teristic curve to the anemometers used up 
to now, whereby its sign is a clear indica-
tion of the flow direction.

Due to its small size, the micromechani-
cal flowmeter is only a partial-flowmeter. 
In other words, it is no longer in any way 
able to average-out any non-homogeneity 
in the flow velocity as a function of the 
flow cross-sectional area. Rather,

Gas sensors and 
concentration sensors

Measured variables
The concentration of a given material or 
medium defines the mass or volume per-
cent of a given material in another given 
material or in a mixture or combination of 
other materials. With a concentration sen-
sor (also known as a concentration probe, 
the important thing is that in the ideal case 
it is sensitive to only one medium, while at 
the same time practically “ignoring” all 
other mediums. Of course, in practice, ev-
ery concentration sensor has its own cross 
sensitivity to other mediums even though, 
as is often the case, “temperature” and 
“pressure” are maintained constant. 

In the vehicle, the following parameters 

must be measured:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

   Oxygen content in the exhaust gas 
(closed-loop combustion control, 
 catalytic-converter monitoring)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

   Carbon-monoxide and nitrogen-oxide 
content, as well as air humidity inside 
the vehicle (air quality, misting of vehi-
cle windows)

   Humidity in the compressed-air brake 

system (air-drier monitoring)

   Dampness of the outside air (black ice

(cid:129)(cid:129)

   Concentration of soot in diesel-engine 
exhaust gas. A still unsolved problem.  
In contrast to the above-mentioned gas 
concentrations, this is a particle concen-
tration. The difficulties inherent in the 
measuring assignment are further ag-
gravated by the possibility of the sensor 
being blocked by particles so that it no 
longer functions. 

The introduction of the fuel cell as an auto-
motive drive means that further gas sen-
sors will have to be developed, for instance 
for the detection of hydrogen.

Measuring principles
Measured mediums occur in gaseous, liquid, 
or solid state, so that in the course of time 
countless measuring methods have been de-
veloped. For automotive applications, until 
now only the gas-analysis area, and in par-
ticular the measurement of gaseous humid-
ity, has been of any interest. Table 1 presents 
an overview of the processes applied in gen-
eral measurement techniques.

Gas measurement in general
Gas sensors are usually in direct unpro-
tected contact with the monitored medium 
(in other words with foreign matter) so 
that the danger of irreversible damage 
 exists. This form of damage is referred to 
as sensor “contamination”. For instance, 
the lead that may be contained in fuel or 
the exhaust gas can make the electrolytic 
oxygen concentration sensors (Lambda 
oxygen sensors) unusable. 

Moisture measurement
In addition to the outstanding significance 
of the Lambda oxygen sensor in dealing 
with exhaust gases, moisture measurement 
also plays an important role.

In the broader sense, moisture indicates 
the moisture content of gaseous, liquid, or 
solid substances. In the narrower sense, 
we are dealing here with the gaseous-wa-
ter (water vapor) content in gaseous media – 
above all in the air.

For low-cost applications (for instance in

trigger a usually drastic change in a resis-

be the mounting wafer, serves as the 
 dielectric of a capacitor. Either one of the 
electrodes is permeable to water, or the 
electrodes have a comb-like structure 
(Fig. 2). With increasing humidity, the 
 dielectric absorbs more water and the 
 sensor’s capacitance increases consider-
ably (relative dielectric constant of water 
«rW ≈ 81, Fig. 3).

In the case of the resistive sensor, an insu-
lation substrate is coated with a layer of 
hygroscopic salt (LiCi) held in a paste 
binder and located between an electrode 
pair. The layer’s conductivity changes 
drastically along with the relative humidity 
(Fig. 3). Unfortunately this resistance 
change is also highly dependent upon tem-
perature so that normally compensation  
is needed. The dew point can also be de-
fined, and with it the absolute humidity,  
by an additional measurement of the air 
temperature. The typical time constants  
of these sensors are about 30 s.

Table 2 gives an overview of the numerous 
measurement processes that have been 
developed in the course of time for humid-
ity measurement.

234     Sensor measuring principles  |  Temperature sensors

Temperature sensors

Measured variables
Temperature is defined as a nondirectional 
quantity which characterizes the energy 
state of a given medium, and which can be 
a function of time and location:
T = T (x, y, z, t) 
where: x, y, z are the spatial coordinates, 
t is time, and T is measured according to 
the Celsius or Kelvin scale.

(1)

Generally speaking, with monitored media 
which are in gaseous or liquid form, mea-
surements can be taken at any point. In the 
case of solid bodies, measurement is usu-
ally restricted to the body’s surface. With 
the most commonly used temperature sen-
sors, in order for it to assume the medi-
um’s temperature as precisely as possible, 
the sensor must be directly in contact with 
the monitored medium (direct-contact 
thermo meter). In special cases though, 
proximity or non-contacting temperature 
sensors are in use which measure the me-
dium’s temperature by means of its (infra-
red) thermal radiation (radiation ther-
mometer =  Pyrometer, thermal camera).

Generally speaking, a temperature sensor 
should reflect this dependency correctly, 
in other words, it should reflect as accu-
rately as possible the local distribution of 
the temperature and its change as a func-
tion of time. 

In special cases, possibly for functional 
reasons, this stipulation can be relaxed 
somewhat. The call for high local resolu-
tion and for high-speed response both de-
mand that the sensor should be as small as 
possible, since it should not falsify the 
temperature readings by itself absorbing 
heat. In other words it should have a low 
thermal capacity. 

In order to ensure that the temperature 

assumed by the sensor remains indepen-
dent of the usually very different temper-
ature of its mounting, it should be ther-
mally well insulated from it. Since this 
also falsifies the measurement, the heat 
developed by the majority of sensors in 
the active state should be kept to a mini-
mum (e.g. < 1 mW).

The temperature sensor’s dynamic re-
sponse is specified by the time constant t. 
This defines the time taken by the sensor 
to reach 63 %, 90 %, or 99 % of its final 
reading when subjected to a jump in 
 temperature. This time depends not only 
upon the sensor’s thermal capacity, but 
also to a great extent upon the heat-trans-
fer coefficient between the sensor and  
the monitored medium. The higher it is, 
the faster the sensor reaches its final 
reading. Naturally, this figure is far higher 
for liquid mediums than for gaseous me-
diums. It must also be noted that the heat-
transfer coefficient is highly influenced 
by any flow velocity y in the medium. It 
––
increases with approximately √
y. In other 
words, the time constant of a temperature 
sensor should always be specified with 
reference to a specific flow velocity of a 
defined medium.

Sensor measuring principles  |  Temperature sensors     235

Temperature measurement in the vehicle 
makes use almost exclusively of the tem-
perature-dependence of electrical resis-
tance material with positive (PTC) or nega-
tive (NTC) temperature coefficient. The 
 direct-contact thermometers apply this 
pheno mena. For the most part, the conver-
sion of the temperature change to an ana-
log voltage takes place by adding a second 
resistor to form a voltage divider (which 
also has a linearizing effect). Recently 
though, non-contacting  (pyrometric) tem-
perature sensing has been considered for 
occupant-protection (passenger-position 
monitoring for airbag triggering), and for 
comfort and convenience (air conditioning 
in accordance with skin-temperature mea-
surement, prevention of windscreen mist-
up). It needed the advent of microsystem 
technology for this (pyrometric) method to 
become feasible from the costs viewpoint. 
Table 1 presents a listing of the tempera-
tures which have to be measured in the 
 vehicle.

It is not only the highly differing measur-
ing ranges that demand a variety of differ-
ent sensor concepts and technologies, but 
the different accuracies and dynamic re-
sponse requirements also lead to very dif-
ferent sensor shapes. At many locations, 
temperature is also measured in order 
that it can be compensated in cases where 
temperature variations trigger faults or 
act as an undesirable influencing variable.

Measuring principles for  
direct-contact sensors
The fact that practically all physical pro-
cesses are temperature-dependent means 
that there are almost just as many methods 
for making temperature measurements. 
The preferable methods though are those 
in which the temperature effect is very dis-
tinctive and dominant and as far as possi-
ble features a linear characteristic curve. 
Furthermore, the measuring elements 
should be suitable for inexpensive mass-
production, whereby they should be ade-
quately reproducible and non-aging. 
 Taking these considerations into account, 
the following sensor techniques have come 
to the forefront, some of which are also 
 applied in automotive technology:

Resistive sensors
In the form of 2-pole elements, tempera-
ture-dependent electrical resistors are par-
ticularly suitable for temperature measure-
ment, no matter whether in wire-wound, 
sintered ceramic, foil, thin-film, thick-film, 
or monocrystalline form. Normally, in or-
der to generate a voltage-analog signal 
they are combined with a fixed resistor RV 
to form a voltage divider, or load-indepen-
dent current is applied (Fig. 1). The volt-
age-divider circuit changes the original 
sensor characteristic R(T) to a slightly 
 different characteristic U(T):

R(T)
 
U(T) = U0 · –––––––––––––– 
R(T) + RV
 

On the other hand, the application of a 
supply current I0 permits the resistor 
curve to be reproduced exactly:

U(T) = I0 · R(T) 

(2)

(3)

The measurement sensitivity is reduced 
more or less depending upon the con-
struction of the voltage-divider circuit. 
Notwithstanding this fact, in the case of 
 resistance characteristics which display a

slightly progressive curve it does have a 
linearization influence (an effect which is 
usually very welcome). Very often, in this 
connection, the auxiliary resistor is so di-
mensioned that it equals the measuring re-
sistor at a given reference temperature T0 
(e.g. 20 °C): 

RV ≈ R (T0) 

(4)

If the precision is inadequate, a resistance 
sensor can be calibrated to the setpoint 
value both with regard to its resistance (re-
ferred to a reference temperature), and its 
temperature coefficient (TC), by means of 
an adjustable parallel resistor RP and a 
 serial resistor RS (Fig. 2). Of course, when 
fixed resistors are added the TC is reduced 
and the characteristic changes somewhat.

Sintered-ceramic NTC resistors
As a result of their pronounced measuring 
effects and inexpensive manufacture, the 
most common semiconductor resistors in 
use are based on heavy-metal oxides and 

oxidized mixed crystals. These are sin-
tered in bead form or disc form (Fig. 3) and 
have a polycrystalline structure. Because 
of their very steep temperature curve, they 
are also known as NTC resistors or therm-
istors. To a good approximation, and by 
applying the exponential law, their charac-
teristic curve can be defined as follows:

 
 
R(T ) = R0 · e 

 

B · (–– – ––   ) 

1  1
T    T0

(5)

Where R0 = R(T0), 
B = 2,000 to 5,000 K = const,
T absolute temperature

Here, the characteristic-curve gradient 
(TC) or the percentage resistance change 
as a function of temperature, is highly 
 dependent upon the working point.  
This means that it can only be defined  
at given points: 

TC = – B/T 2

It reduces considerably along with increas-
ing temperature, and the resistance value 
itself frequently varies by 4 to 5 powers of 
ten, e.g. typically from a few 100 kΩ to a 
few 10 Ω. This pronounced temperature-
dependence means that applications are 
 restricted to a “window” of about 200 K. 
This though can be selected in the range 
from –40 to approximately 850 °C. Tighter 
tolerances of up to ± 0.5 K at a given refer-
ence point are complied with by using a se-
lection process, or possibly even by grind-
ing in oil, a method which of course has an 
affect upon costs. The aging stability of 
these sensors has been vastly improved 
compared to earlier versions which means 
that it is quite possible for the very close 
tolerances to apply throughout the sensor’s 
useful life.

PTC thin-film/thick-film metallic resistors
The thin-film metallic resistors placed with 
two additional temperature-neutral cali-
bration resistors on a common substrate 
wafers have particularly high accuracy val-
ues. They can be tightly toleranced in re-
spect of their characteristic curve and can 
be manufactured to be stable over the long 
term and are additionally trimmed by laser 
cuts. The use of layer technology makes it 
possible to adapt the substrate (ceramic, 
glass, plastic foil) and the upper layers 
(plastic molding or paint, sealed foil, glass 
and ceramic coatings) to the respective 
 application, and thus provide protection 
against the monitored medium. Although 
metallic layers are less sensitive to thermal 
variations than the ceramic-oxide semi-
conductor sensors, both linearity and re-
producibility are better: The following ap-
plies for the computational definition of 
these sensors:

R(T) = R0 (1 + a · ∆T + b · ∆T 2 + ..) 

(7)

where ∆T = T – T0 and
T0 = 20  °C (reference temperature),
a linear temperature coefficient (TC),
b square temperature coefficient.

Even though the b coefficient is generally 
very small for metals, it cannot be ignored 
completely. This is why the measurement 
sensitivity of such sensors is usually char-
acterized by means of a mean TC, the  
“TC 100”. The TC 100 corresponds to the 
mean curve gradient between 0 °C and 
100 °C (Table 2 and Figure 4).

Although platinum (Pt) resistors have the 
lowest TC, they are not only the most pre-
cise resistive temperature sensors, but can 
also boast the best aging stability. They are 
available on the market under the designa-
tion “PT 100” or “PT 1000” (100 Ω or 
1,000 Ω nominal resistance at a reference 
temperature of 20 °C) in a variety of differ-
ent tolerance classes (up to 0.1  °C) (Fig. 5). 
At temperatures up to about 1,000 °C, 
thick-film platinum sensors are suitable 
whose platinum layer has been stabilized 
by special additives.

Thick-film resistors (PTC/NTC)
Thick-film pastes with both high resis-
tance (low surface-area requirement) and 
positive and negative temperature coeffi-
cients are generally employed as tempera-
ture sensors for compensation purposes. 
They have a non-linear characteristic 
curve (which though is not as “bent” as  
the curve of the solid NTC resistors), and 
are suitable for laser-trimming. The mea-
suring effect is improved by forming 
 voltage-divider  circuits from NTC and  
PTC materials.

Monocrystalline silicon semiconductor 
 resistors (PTC)
Basically speaking, with temperature sen-
sors of monocrystalline semiconductor 
materials such as silicon (Si), it is possible 
to incorporate further active and passive 
circuit elements on the sensor chip (initial 
signal conditioning at the measuring 
point). Due to the closer tolerances in-
volved, their production uses the “spread-
ing resistance” principle (Fig. 6a). The cur-
rent flows through the measuring resistor 
and through a surface-point contact before 
arriving at the silicon bulk material. It then 
proceeds, widely distributed, to a counter-

electrode covering the base of the sensor 
chip. In addition to the high reproducibil-
ity material constants, the high current 
density behind the contact point (high ac-
curacy thanks to photolithographic pro-
duction) mainly defines the sensor’s resis-
tance. In order to make the sensor highly 
independent of polarity, these sensors are 
usually series-connected in pairs in oppo-
site alignments (dual-hole version, Fig. 6). 
The base electrode can be in the form of  
a temperature contact (no electrical func-
tion).

Thermocouples
Thermocouples are used in particular for 
measuring ranges ≥ 1,000 °C. They rely on 
the Seebeck effect, according to which 
there is a voltage across the ends of a me-
tallic conductor when these are at differ-
ent temperatures T1 and T2. This “thermo-
electric voltage” Uth depends (independently 
of the development of this) exclusively on 
the temperature difference ∆T at the ends 
of the conductors (Fig. 8). It is expressed 
by the equation:

Measurement sensitivity is practically dou-

Uth = c (T2 – T1 ) = c ∆T,  

(9)

ble that of a Pt resistor (TC = 7.73 · 10–3/K). 
The progressive bend of the temperature 
curve is more pronounced than on a metal-
lic sensor. The measuring range is limited 
to approx. +150 °C by the material’s intrin-
sic conductivity (Fig. 6b). There are special 
versions (Fig. 7) available for uses up to 
300 °C.

where the proportionality constant is ma-
terial-specific and termed the Seebeck 
 coefficient. 

Since the instrument leads used to mea-

sure this voltage across the metallic con-
ductor must themselves be equipped with 
terminals (for instance made of copper),

these are also subject to the same temper-
ature difference, so that unfortunately 
only the difference between the metallic 
conductor and the connecting cables is 
measured. Thermoelectric voltages are 
 always listed based on Platinum as the 
 reference material (Table 3). 

In order that the generated voltages are 

as high as possible, a number of material 
pairs have established themselves (Fig. 9, 
e.g. iron/constantan etc.). It is important 
that the “limbs” of such a thermocouple 
are joined at the end to which the heat is 
applied in such a manner that the joint is 
electrically conductive (by means of twist-
ing, welding, soldering, etc., Fig. 10). 

Thermocouples themselves are usually 
short, and the extensions up to the point 
where the signal is captured can be made 
with compensating cables which use the 
same material pair as in the thermocouple 
itself. It is important that both free ends  

of the thermoelement configuration are at 
the same (reference) temperature, other-
wise the temperature difference at the free 
ends will also be included in the measure-
ment. Thermocouples, therefore, always 
measure only the temperature difference 
to a given reference point. If the measur-
ing point’s absolute temperature is to be 
measured, other devices (such as resistive 
sensors) must be used to also measure the 
temperature at the reference point. 

The characteristic curve of the thermo-
electric voltage against temperature is usu-
ally not as linear as that given in equation 
(9). The sensor signals are usually small, and 
ICs are used for their amplification and for 
their linearization. In order to increase the 
measurement voltage, it is common practice 
to connect a number of identical thermocou-
ples in series. These have their “hot” junc-
tions at the temperature to be measured, 
and their “cold” junctions at the reference 
temperature (Fig. 11, thermopile).

Although thermocouples are robust (for 
instance, high-level EMC due to low inter-
nal resistance), they are not particularly 
accurate as a measuring device. Their 
 deviation can easily be in the 5° to 15 °C 
range, and they are not outstanding re-
garding their resistance to aging, which 
means that individual calibration does  
not result in a permanent improvement  
of their accuracy.

Of course, thermocouples can be manu-

factured using both thin-film and thick-
film techniques. Metallic films stacked one 
on top of the other provide for excellent 
thermal contact, and extremely small ther-
mocouples can be produced by applying 
microsystem technology. Thermocouples 
are particularly suitable for use in thermo-
piles comprised for instance from 50 to 
100 individual thermocouples. They are 
used in non-contacting radiation ther-
mometers (pyrometers).

Semiconductor depletion layers
Presuming a constant current, the forward 
voltage of semiconductor depletion layers 
(Fig. 12) such as those in diodes and in the 
basis-emitter path of a transistor, demon-
strate very good linearity as a function of 
temperature:

 
UF(T) = ––––––– · ln (–––– + 1) 
 

k · T 
q 

IF
Isat

(10)

Where:
Isat = Isat (T) and IF = constant,
q = 1.6 · 10 –19 C (elementary charge),
k = 1.88 · 10 –23 JK–1 (Boltzmann’s constant),
T absolute temperature.

It is advantageous here when the sensor 
directly outputs a voltage which is a func-
tion of the temperature. The two-pole sen-
sor is of course dependent upon polarity. 
Whereas, for all sensors, the forward volt-
age decreases by almost exactly 2 mV/°C, 
the absolute voltage at each depletion 
layer differs considerably from sensor to 

sensor, and may necessitate additional cal-
ibration elements in order for a precise 
measurement to be made. Above all, it is 
the temperature-dependent saturation 
current Isat which is responsible for the 
negative temperature coefficient (NTC). 
This current increases dramatically with 
rising temperature. Here, the silicon’s in-
trinsic conductivity limits this sensor’s ap-
plication to temperature ranges <150 °C. 
Sometimes, emitter-coupled transistor 
pairs are used in a similar manner for tem-
perature measurement. With this form of 
temperature measurement, the ratios of 
the collector currents to each other repre-
sent a very good reproducible measure for 
the temperature. Usually, an integrated 
supplementary circuit is used for the  
“on-chip” conversion to an analog output 
voltage. 

Zener diodes operated in the reverse di-
rection can also be used as highly practical 
temperature sensors. Their voltage changes 
are highly dependent upon the Zener volt-
age. Here, the option exists of various lev-
els of voltage reduction at Zener voltages 
<4.7 V, and voltage increases at Zener volt-
ages >4.7 V.

Such sensors are often used for temper-

ature compensation on the chip itself.

Measuring principles for non-contacting 
temperature measurement
The radiation emitted by a body is used for 
the non-contact measurement (pyrometry) 
of its temperature. This radiation is for the 
most part in the infrared (IR) range (wave-
length: 5 to 20 µm). Strictly speaking, the 
product of the radiated power and the 
emission coefficient of the body is mea-
sured. The latter is a function of the mate-
rial, but for materials which are technically 
of interest (including glass) it is usually 
around 1, although for reflective and IR-
permeable materials (e.g. air, silicon) it is 
far less than 1. 

The measuring point is reproduced on a 

radiation-sensitive element, which heats 
up slightly with respect to its environment 
(typically 0.01 to 0.001 °C). The element’s 
temperature is a measure for the tempera-

ture of the body being measured. A given 
temperature difference at the object often 
corresponds to only 1/1,000th of this dif-
ference at the measuring point. Neverthe-
less, the object’s temperature can be deter-
mined with an accuracy of 0.5 °C.

Bolometer
The Bolometer is a highly sensitive resis-
tance temperature sensor for measuring 
minute temperature increases (Fig. 13).  
A further sensor is needed for measuring 
the temperature of the sensor housing. If 
this device is to operate efficiently across  
a wide temperature range, it is necessary 
though for both these sensors to feature  
an extremely high degree of synchronism. 
The Bolometer housing is therefore usu-
ally thermostatically controlled (and well-
insulated to the housing) so that the pri-
mary detecting element (sensor) always 
operates at the same temperature.

Thermopile sensor
When a very extensive temperature range 
is concerned, it is more practical for the 
temperature difference generated by the 
radiation from the object to be measured 
using thermocouples. In order to increase 
the measuring effect, a number of thermo-
couples are connected in series (thermo-
pile). Such a thermopile sensor (Fig. 14) is 
inexpensive to manufacture micromechan-
ically. All its “hot” junctions are located on 
a thermally well insulated thin diaphragm, 

14 Pyrometric sensor produced using micromechanical techniques, with thermopile pick-off.

sive curved mirror is usually ruled out due 
to it needing too much room. Glass lenses 
are impermeable for IR light, and plastic 
lenses can only be used for operating tem-
peratures of up to approx. 85 °C max. On 
the other hand, Si lenses are highly suit-
able for thermal radiation and up to diam-
eters of approx. 4 mm micromechanical 
techniques can be used to inexpensively 
manufacture them in the form of a Fresnel 
or refraction lens. Fitted in the cover of  
a TO5 housing, these then also serve to 
protect the sensor against direct damage 
(Fig. 15). Even though filling the housing 
with an inert gas improves the crosstalk 
between the individual pixels, it also nega-
tively affects their response time.

and all its “cold” junctions are in contact 
with the thicker chip rim (heat sink). Typi-
cally, the sensor’s response time is approx. 
20 ms. Using such a so-called “single-pixel 
sensor”, it is an easy matter to determine 
the windshield’s surface temperature so 
that measures can be taken to prevent 
misting should the temperature fall below 
the dew point.

Single-point sensors, imaging sensors
If a number of pixels are combined on a 
single chip (e.g. 4 x 4) to form an array,  
this provides the basis for a rough form  
of image analysis (Fig. 16). However, there 
should not be too much insensitive surface 
area between the pixels and the pixels 
themselves must be thermally well insu-
lated against each other. As all the pixels 
can optionally respond electrically, the 
chip has a large number of terminals. On  
a TO5 housing, for example, the ASIC for 
signal preamplification and series connec-
tion of the signal must be located directly 
adjacent to the sensor chip. Usually, in the 
case of thermopile sensors, this ASIC also 
includes a reference-temperature sensor 
which measures the pixel’s absolute tem-
perature. This permits object tempera-
tures to be measured with an accuracy  
of approx. ±0.5 K.

In order to reproduce a scene thermally 
on the sensor array, the array requires an 
IR optical imaging unit. The very inexpen-

Imaging sensors (video) 

In particular, imaging sensors are begin-
ning to gain a hold in the motor vehicle us-
ing visible light or infrared light. They can 
be used for passenger-compartment moni-
toring, but are principally aimed at obser-
vation outside the vehicle.

All of these sensors have one objective 

in view, and that is the simulation of the 
superior capabilities of the human eye  
and its mental recognition capabilities  
(of course, only to a very modest degree  
at first). These were introduced in large 
numbers to industrial measurements some 
time ago – in particular on robot handling 
equipment. The costs of imaging sensors, 
and the associated very high-performance 
processors needed for the interpretation 
of a scene, are already of interest for appli-
cations in the automotive sector.

In contrast to the human eye, common 
imaging sensors are sensitive in the near 
IR range (wavelength approximately 
1 mm). With appropriate non-visible 
IR illumination, therefore, all imaginable 
applications in the vehicle become feasi-
ble, including nighttime operation. For 
 applications in the visible light range, the 
imaging sensors generally have an IR filter 
in front of them to prevent false recordings 
due to color.

In future, imaging sensors will be able to 
play a highly variegated role for the obser-
vation of the vehicle’s interior (seating po-
sition, forward shift in case of a crash, size 
of seat occupants etc.), and of the vehicle’s 
surroundings (lane guidance, collision 
prevention, parking and reversing aids, 
road-sign recognition). A night vision de-
vice, that takes the IR image recorded for 
the road and displays it on a screen in the 
dashboard, thus offering enhanced driving 
safety in poor visibility (darkness, fog, etc.) 
is already in series production.

Imaging sensors are a special case of mul-
tisensor structures comprising light-sensi-
tive elements (photodiodes), arranged as 
pixels in a row or matrix form and receiv-
ing the light through a conventional imag-
ing optical system. In the case of the sili-
con imaging sensors principally available 
(CCD, Charge-Coupled Devices, Figs. 1 and 
2), free charge carriers are generated pro-
portionally to the intensity and exposure 
time by the light arriving through a trans-
parent electrode; they are then collected 
in a “potential pot” (Si-SiO2 boundary 
layer). Further electrodes move these 
charges into an opaque zone which are 
further transported in analog shift regis-
ters (bucket chain principle) line-by-line 
into an output register which is read seri-
ally at a high clock rate.

While CCD sensors can only be used in 
motor vehicles to a very limited degree 
because of their limited brightness/dark-
ness dynamics (50 dB), their read time and 
their temperature range (< 50 °C), newer, 
smart, imaging sensors based on CMOS 
technology appear to be fully suitable for 
use in the motor vehicle. The logarithmic 
brightness/signal curve possible here, 
corresponds to the human eye and has a 
dynamic response of 120 dB. This makes 
aperture control, for instance, unneces-
sary and supplies a constant contrast reso-
lution across the entire brightness range. 
These sensors permit a digitally controlled, 
random access to the individual pixels in 
a matrix sensor (Fig. 3) with simultaneous 
higher sensitivity (higher read rate).

The first steps in preprocessing the 
 signals on the imaging-sensor chip have 
 already been implemented (intelligent 
 imaging sensor). A resolution of 
1,280 × 1,024 pixels with typical indi- 
vidual dimensions of 6 µm × 6 µm is 
 already possible in sensors currently  
on the market.

Engine-speed sensors 

Application
Engine-speed sensors are used in engine-
management systems for
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Measuring the engine speed and
  Determining the crankshaft position 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(position of the pistons)

The engine speed is calculated from the in-
terval between the speed sensor’s signals. 

Inductive speed sensors
Design and operating principle
The sensor is mounted directly opposite a 
ferromagnetic pulse wheel (Fig. 1, Item 7) 
from which it is separated by a narrow air 
gap. It has a soft-iron core (pole pin, 4), 
which is enclosed by a winding (5). The 
pole pin is also connected to a permanent 
magnet (1), and a magnetic field extends 
through the pole pin and into the pulse 
wheel. The level of the magnetic flux 
through the coil depends on whether the 
sensor is opposite a pulse-wheel tooth  
or space. Whereas the magnet’s leakage 
flux is concentrated by a tooth, and leads 
to an increase in the magnetic flux through 
the coil, it is attenuated by a space. When 
the pulse wheel rotates, these changes in 
magnetic flux induce a sinusoidal output 
voltage in the coil which is proportional to 
the rate of change of the flux and thus the 

engine speed (Fig. 2). The amplitude of the 
alternating voltage increases strongly 
along with increasing pulse-wheel speed 
(several mV to >100 V). At least about  
30 rpm are needed to generate an ade-
quate amplitude. 

The number of teeth on the pulse wheel 
depends on the particular application. In 
Motronic systems, a 60-pitch pulse wheel 
is normally used, although 2 teeth are omit-
ted (Fig. 1, Item 7) so that the pulse wheel 
has 60 – 2 = 58 teeth. The space where the 
missing teeth would be situated is allocated 
to a defined crankshaft position and serves  
as a reference mark for synchronizing the 
control unit.

The geometries of the pulse-wheel teeth 
and the pole pin must be matched to each 
other. An evaluation circuit in the control 
unit converts the sinusoidal voltage, which 
is characterized by strongly varying ampli-
tudes, into a constant-amplitude square-
wave voltage for evaluation in the control 
unit microcontroller.

Active speed sensors
Active speed sensors operate according to 
the magnetostatic principle. The amplitude 
of the output signal is not dependent on the 
rotational speed. This makes it possible for 
very low speeds to be sensed (quasistatic 
speed sensing).

Differential Hall sensor
A voltage UH proportional to the magnetic 
field (Hall voltage) can be picked off hori-
zontally to the current direction at a cur-
rent-carrying plate which is permeated 
vertically by a magnetic induction B. In 
a differential Hall sensor, the magnetic 
field is generated by a permanent magnet 
(Fig. 3, Item 1). Two Hall sensor elements 
(2 and 3) are situated between the magnet 
and the pulse wheel (4). The magnetic flux 
by which these are permeated depends on 
whether the speed sensor is opposite a 
tooth or a space. Determining the differ-
ence between the signals from two sensors 
reduces the magnetic interference signals 
and achieves and improved signal/noise 
ratio. The edges of the sensor signal can  
be processed without digitization directly 
in the control unit. 

Multipole wheels are used instead of the 
ferromagnetic pulse wheel. Here, a magne-
tizable plastic is attached to a nonmagnetic 
metallic carrier and alternately magne-
tized. These north and south poles adopt 
the function formerly performed by the 
teeth of the pulse wheel. 

AMR sensors
The electrical resistance of magnetoresis-
tive material (AMR, Anisotrop Magneto 
Resistive) is anisotropic, i.e. it depends on 
the direction of the magnetic field to which 
it is exposed. This property is utilized in 
an AMR sensor. The sensor is located 
 between a magnet and a pulse wheel.  
The field lines change direction when the 
pulse wheel rotates (Fig. 4). This generates 
a sinusoidal voltage, which is amplified in 
an evaluation circuit in the sensor and 
converted into a square-wave signal. 

GMR sensors
The use of GMR technology (Giant Mag-
neto Resistive) is a further development  
of active speed sensors. Because of the 
higher sensitivity by comparison with the 
AMR sensors, larger air gaps are possible, 
which makes applications in difficult cir-
cumstances possible. The higher sensitiv-
ity also results in less background noise 
from the signal edges. 

All two-wire current interfaces previ-
ously used for Hall speed sensors may  
also be used on GMR sensors.

piston is in the compression or exhaust 
stroke. The phase sensor on the camshaft 
provides the control unit with this infor-
mation. This is required, for example, for 
ignition systems with single-spark ignition 
coils and for sequential fuel injection (SEFI).

Design and operating principle
Hall rod sensors
Hall rod sensors (Fig. 1a) utilize the Hall 
effect: a rotor of ferromagnetic material  
(7, pulse wheel with teeth, segments or 
 aperture plate) rotates along with the cam-
shaft. The Hall IC (6) is located between 
the pulse wheel and a permanent magnet 
(5), which generates a magnetic field 
strength perpendicular to the Hall ele-
ment. 

If one of the pulse-wheel teeth (Z)  
now passes the current-carrying sensor 
 element (semiconductor wafer), it changes 
the magnetic-field strength perpendicular 
to the Hall element. This results in a volt-
age signal (Hall voltage) which is indepen-
dent of the relative speed between sensor 
and pulse wheel. The evaluation electron-
ics integrated in the sensor’s Hall IC condi-
tion the signal and output it in the form of a 
square-wave signal (Fig. 1b).

Sensor types  |  Speed sensors for transmission control     249

Because of the very compact design of the 
transmissions, the mechanical customer 
interface cannot generally be covered  
by standard geometries. This means that 
custom sensor types are needed for each 
transmission model. Module-integrated 
types differ in respect of insertion length, 
direction of recording and mounting 
flange (Fig. 1). A further variation found  
in stand-alone sensors is the location of 
the mounting socket and the design of  
the connector.

Hall ASICs (Application Specific Inte-
grated Circuit) with varying complexities 
of the evaluation algorithms are used to 
cover the complete range of the functional 
requirements (Fig. 2). 

If a ferromagnetic trigger wheel or  
a trigger area (toothed, stamped or em-
bossed) is available on the rotating trans-
mission component, the magnetic field 
 required to operate the Hall sensor is 
 generated by a back-bias magnet.

Speed sensors for 
 transmission control

Application
Transmission speed sensors determine 
the shaft speeds in AT, ASG, DKG and  
CVT transmissions. These are the turbine 
and output shaft speeds on AT transmis-
sions with a hydrodynamic torque con-
verter, the speed of the primary and sec-
ondary pulleys in CVT transmissions and 
the speeds of the two input shafts and the 
driven shaft of double-clutch transmis-
sions. The speed of the power take-up 
 element is also detected for high dynamic 
demands on power take-up control. 

Direction of rotation detection can also 
be necessary in high-end transmissions in 
order to optimize clutch management and 
for rollback prevention.

Both stand-alone sensors and sensors 
built into electronics modules which proj-
ect into the transmission from the outside 
or are mounted internally are used. 

Requirements
Transmission speed sensors are exposed 
to very severe operating stresses because 
of

-40 and +150 °C

transmission oil has been achieved by 
 using a suitable oil-resistant package.

It is mounted in the sensor immediately 
behind the ASIC.

Compact transmissions increasingly 
require speed measurement over greater 
distances (magnetic air gap) by rotating, 
nonmagnetic components or through a 
housing wall. Multipole wheels (magne-
tized rings) are used for these applica-
tions, the back-bias magnet is omitted 
from the sensor. 

Design
The Hall ASICs used in the transmission 
speed sensors are mounted in a retainer 
with or without a back-bias magnet – 
 depending on the magnetic interface –  
with the electrical contact being made  
by a welding process, then inserted in  
a housing, potted with epoxy resin or – in 
the case of types mounted on the outside 
of the transmission – have an oil-tight en-
closure sprayed onto them (Fig. 3).

The sensor has a two-wire interface, 
which combines optimum diagnostic op-
tions with a minimum number of electrical 
connections. The two terminals both sup-
ply the Hall IC and transmit the signal.

Operating principle
Transmission speed sensors use the differ-
ential Hall effect. The difference between 
the Hall voltages from two Hall plates on 
the ASIC is determined. The majority of 
the similar interferences can be compen-
sated for in this way. The difference signal 
is first amplified on some ASIC types,  
then converted into a digital signal by 
 trigger algorithms of varying complexities. 
This constitutes the controlled variable for 
modulating the output current by means  
of a power source. A digital signal with  
two current levels (typically 7 mA for the

obtained, the modulation frequency of 
which corresponds to the frequency of 
tooth change on the trigger wheel and  
thus represents the speed of rotation.  
The sensor signal is evaluated in the elec-
tronic control unit by means of a measur-
ing shunt RM, which converts the sensor 
current IS into the signal voltage URM.

On principle, it does not matter for  
the operation of a differential Hall ASICs 
whether the sensor is operated with a 
steel trigger wheel or on a multipole 
wheel (Figs. 4a and 4b).

Some transmission controls include func-
tions that require detection of a standstill. 
For this application, the sensor must have 
as great an immunity as possible against 
vibration-induced variations in the air gap 
and the torsional vibration of the trigger 
wheel. This property of the sensor, known 
as immunity against vibration, can only  
be implemented to a very limited degree  
in differential Hall sensors with only two  
Hall plates, by the use of adaptive trigger 
thresholds, for example. Two phase-
shifted differential signals become avail-
able with the use of a third Hall plate.  
This makes both the detection of the di-
rection of rotation (Figs. 4c to f) and addi-
tional function algorithms for increasing 
immunity against vibration possible.

The typical values for “value” and “high 
feature” sensors differ in the air gap range 
achievable (distance between the sensitive 
area on the sensor and the trigger wheel), 
the signal frequency range and the addi-
tional functionalities implemented (Table 1).

The complexity of transmission type, 
mounting space restrictions including  
all the derived marginal design conditions 
and the functional requirements leads to 
application-specific solutions in most ap-
plications. These are characterized by a 
combination of ASIC, package design and 
sensor mechanical and magnetic interface 
suitable for the system requirements.

252     Sensor types  |  Wheel-speed sensors

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensor
A passive (inductive) speed sensor con-
sists of a permanent magnet (Fig. 2, 1) with 
a soft-magnetic pole pin (3) connected to 
it, which is inserted into a coil (2) with sev-
eral thousand windings. This setup gener-
ates a constant magnetic field.

The pole pin is installed directly above 
the pulse wheel (4), a gear wheel attached 
to the wheel hub. As the pulse wheel turns, 
the continuously alternating sequence of 
teeth and spaces induces corresponding 
fluctuations in the constant magnetic field. 
This changes the magnetic flux through 
the pole pin and therefore also through  
the coil winding. These fluctuations in the 
magnetic field induce an alternating volt-
age in the coil suitable for monitoring at 
the ends of its winding. 

The frequency and amplitude of this 
 alternating voltage are proportional to 
wheel speed (Fig. 3) and when the wheel is 
not rotating, the induced voltage is zero.

Tooth shape, air gap, rate of voltage rise, 

and the control unit input sensitivity de-
fine the smallest still measurable vehicle 
speed and thus, for ABS applications,  
the minimum response sensitivity and 
switching speed. 

1 Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors

Wheel-speed sensors

Application
Wheel-speed sensors are used to measure 
the rotational speed of the vehicle wheels 
(wheel speed). The speed signals are 
transmitted via cables to the ABS, TCS  
or ESP control unit of the vehicle which 
controls the braking force individually  
at each wheel. This control loop prevents 
the wheels from locking up (with ABS) or 
from spinning (with TCS or ESP) so that  
the vehicle’s stability and steerability are 
maintained.

Navigation systems also use the wheel-

speed signals to calculate the distance 
traveled (e.g. in tunnels or if satellite 
 signals are unavailable).

Design and operating principle
The signals for the wheel-speed sensor are 
generated by a steel pulse generator that  
is fixed to the wheel hub (for passive sen-
sors) or by a multipole magnetic pulse gen-
erator (for active sensors). This pulse gen-
erator has the same rotational speed as the 
wheel and moves past the sensitive area  
of the sensor head without touching it.  
The sensor “reads” without direct contact 
via an air gap of up to 2 mm (Fig. 2).

The air gap (with strict tolerances) en-
sures interference-free signal acquisition. 
Possible interference caused for instance 
by oscillation patterns in the vicinity of the 
brakes, vibrations, temperature, moisture, 
installation conditions at the wheel, etc. is 
therefore eliminated.

Since 1998 active wheel-speed sensors 
have been used almost exclusively with 
new developments instead of passive  
(inductive) wheel-speed sensors.

Various pole-pin configurations and 
 installation options are available to adapt 
the system to the different installation con-
ditions encountered with various wheels. 
The most common variants are the chisel-
type pole pin (Fig. 1a, also called a flat  
pole pin) and the rhombus-type pole pin  
(Fig. 1b, also called a lozenge-shaped pole 
pin). Both pole-pin designs necessitate 
precise alignment to the pulse wheel 
 during installation.

Active wheel-speed sensor
Sensor elements
Active wheel-speed sensors are used al-
most exclusively in today’s modern brake 
systems (Fig. 4). These sensors usually 
consist of a hermetic, plastic-cast silicon 
IC that sits in the sensor head. 

In addition to magnetoresistive ICs  
(the electrical resistance changes as the 
magnetic field changes) Bosch now uses 
Hall sensor elements almost exclusively. 
These sensors react to the smallest 
changes in the magnetic field and there-
fore allow greater air gaps compared to 
passive wheel-speed sensors.

Pulse wheels
A multipole ring is used as a pulse wheel 
for active wheel-speed sensors. The multi-
pole ring consists of alternately magne-
tized plastic elements that are arranged in 
the shape of a ring on a nonmagnetic metal 
carrier (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7a). These north and 
south poles adopt the function formerly 
performed by the teeth of the pulse wheel. 
The sensor IC is exposed to the continu-
ously changing fields generated by these 
magnets. The magnetic flux through the  
IC therefore changes continuously as the 
multipole ring turns.

A steel pulse wheel can also be used in-
stead of the multipole ring. In this case a 
magnet is mounted on the Hall IC that gen-
erates a constant magnetic field (Fig. 7b). 
As the pulse wheel turns, the continuously 
alternating sequence of teeth and spaces 
induces corresponding fluctuations in the 
constant magnetic field. The measuring 
principle, signal processing and IC are 
 otherwise identical to the sensor without  
a magnet.

Characteristics
A typical feature of the active wheel-speed 
sensor is the integration of a Hall measur-
ing element, signal amplifier and signal 
conditioning in an IC (Fig. 8). The wheel-
speed data is transferred as an impressed 
current in the form of square-wave pulses 
(Fig. 9). The frequency of the pulses is 
 proportional to the wheel speed and the 
speed can be detected until the wheel is 
practically stationary (0.1 km/h).

The supply voltage is between 4.5 and 
20 volts. The square-wave output signal 
level is 7 mA (low) and 14 mA (high).

This type of data transmission using digital 
signals is less sensitive to interference 
than the signals from passive inductive-
type sensors. The sensor is connected to

Compact dimensions combine with low 
weight to make the active wheel-speed 
sensor suitable for installation on and even 
within the vehicle’s wheel-bearing assem-
blies (Fig. 10). Various standard sensor 
head shapes are suitable for this.

Digital signal conditioning makes it possi-
ble to transfer coded additional informa-
tion using a pulse-width-modulated output 
signal (Fig. 11):  
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Direction of wheel rotation recognition:

This is especially significant for the  
“hill hold control” feature, which relies 
on selective braking to prevent the vehi-
cle from rolling backwards during hill 
starts. The direction of rotation recogni-
tion is also used in vehicle navigation 
systems.

This information can also be evaluated  
by the “hill hold control” function.  
The information is also used for self-
 diagnosis.

Information about the signal quality of 
the sensor can be relayed in the signal.  
If a fault occurs the driver can be ad-
vised that service is required.

Micromechanical 
yaw-rate sensors

Applications
In vehicles with electronic stability pro-
gram (ESP), the rotation of the vehicle 
about its vertical axis is registered by mi-
cromechanical yaw-rate (or yaw-speed) 
sensors (also known as gyroscopes) and 
applied for vehicle-dynamics control.  
This takes place during normal cornering, 
for instance, but also when the vehicle 
breaks away or goes into a skid. These sen-
sors are reasonably priced as well as being 
very compact. They have forced out the 
conventional high-precision mechanical 
sensors.

A further area of application is rollover 
 detection in airbag electronic control units 
for triggering restraints (e.g. sidebags/win-
dow airbags, rollover bar) in the event of 
the vehicle rolling over. MM2 yaw-rate 
sensors have been specially developed  
for this area. These are particularly suited 
for the detection of rotary motion around 
the longitudinal axis because of their opti-
mized sensing direction. They permit a 
very compact design and space-saving in-
stallation in airbag control units, installed 
along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. 
Packaging the sensor element and the 
evaluation electronics together in a stan-
dard IC housing contributes to the cost 
 reductions in this area.

MM1 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
A mixed form of technology is applied  
in order to achieve the high accuracies 
needed for vehicle-dynamics systems. 
That is, two somewhat thicker oscillating 
elements (mass plates) which have been 
machined from a wafer using bulk micro-
mechanics oscillate in counter-phase to 
their resonant frequency which is defined 
by their mass and their coupling-spring 
stiffness (>2 kHz). On each of these oscil-
lating elements, there is a miniature, sur-
face-type micromechanical capacitive ac-
celeration sensor. When the sensor chip

below 40 dB). Here, the drive and mea-
surement systems are rigorously decou-
pled from each other.

MM2 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
If the silicon yaw-rate sensor is manufac-
tured completely in surface micromechan-
ics (SMM) and, at the same time, the mag-
netic drive and control system is replaced 
by an electrostatic system, the decoupling 
of drive and measuring system does not 
need to be so thorough. Comb-like struc-
tures (Figs. 3 and 4) electrostatically force 
a centrally mounted rotary oscillator to os-
cillate. The amplitude of these oscillations 
is held constant by means of a similar ca-
pacitive pick-off. Coriolis forces result at

rotates about its vertical axis at yaw rate V, 
these register the Coriolis acceleration in 
the wafer plane vertical to the direction of 
oscillation (Figs. 1 and 2). These accelera-
tions are proportional to the product of 
yaw rate and the oscillation velocity which 
is maintained electronically at a constant 
value. 

To drive the sensor, all that is required is 
a simple, current-carrying conductor track 
on each oscillating element. In the perma-
nent-magnet field B vertical to the chip 
surface, this oscillating element is sub-
jected to an electrodynamic (Lorentz) 
force. Using a further, simple printed 
 conductor (which saves on chip surface), 
the same magnetic field is used to directly 
measure the oscillation velocity by induc-
tive means. The different physical con-
struction of drive system and sensor sys-
tem serves to avoid undesirable coupling 
between the two sections. In order to sup-
press unwanted external acceleration ef-
fects (common-mode signal), the opposing 
sensor signals are subtracted from each 
other. The external acceleration effects 
can be measured by applying summation. 
The high-precision micromechanical con-
struction helps to suppress the effects of 
high oscillatory acceleration which is sev-
eral factors of 10 higher than the low-level 
Coriolis acceleration (cross sensitivity far

the same time in an out-of-plane tilting 
movement, the amplitude of which is pro-
portional to the yaw rate V, and which is 
detected capacitively by the electrodes un-
derneath the oscillator. To avoid excessive 
damping of this movement, the sensor 
must be operated in a vacuum. Although 
the chip’s small size and the somewhat 
simpler production process result in con-
siderable cost reductions, this miniaturiza-
tion is at the expense of reductions in the 
measuring effect, which in any case is  
not very pronounced, and therefore of  
the achievable precision. It also places 
more severe demands on the electronics. 
The system’s high flexural stability, and 
mounting in the axis of gravity, serve to 
mechanically suppress the effects of un-
wanted external acceleration from the 
side.

DRS MM3x sensor cluster
A new generation of micromechanical ele-
ments are used in the DRS MM3x sensor 
cluster. These can measure and digitally 
process angular velocities and accelera-
tions. They create a modular concept for 
hardware and software based on circuit 
board technology with many new safety 
features which lead to a versatile and 
 reliable solution for many applications  
in the vehicle. 

Application
The ESP system, the connection to further 
chassis comfort systems and the develop-
ment of advanced driving stability systems 
called for inertia signals with high require-
ments, in particular in respect of signal 
quality and robustness, additional measur-
ing axes and high reliability. This is why 
Bosch has developed a third generation, 
the versatile yet inexpensive DRS MM3.x 
sensor cluster, to meet the requirements  
of functions such as hill hold control 
(HHC), automated parking brake (APB), 

navigation (Travel Pilot), adaptive cruise 
control (ACC), roll over mitigation (ROM), 
electronic active steering (EAS), active 
 suspension control (ASC), Steer-by-Wire.
DRS MM3.7k is the base variant of the 

MM3 generation for ESP applications.  
It comprises a yaw-rate sensor and an 
 integrated lateral acceleration module. 

Operating principle
The new micromechanical measuring ele-
ment for measuring yaw rate belongs to  
the familiar group of vibrating gyroscopes 
operating according to the Coriolis prin-
ciple (CVG = Coriolis Vibrating Gyros).  
It consists of an inverse tuning fork with  
two linear vibration modes perpendicular 
to one another, the drive circuit and the 
evaluator circuit. Drive and evaluation 
take place electrostatically in a comb-like 
structure. The Coriolis acceleration is 
measured electrostatically using elec-
trodes that extend into each other. The 
measuring element consists of two masses 
connected by a coupling spring. The reso-
nant frequency the same for the two vibra-
tion modes. It is typically around 15 kHz 
and is thus outside the usual interference 
spectrum in the vehicle and is hence resis-
tant to interfering vibration. The evalua-
tion circuit (ASIC) and the micromechani-
cal measuring element are contained in a 
prefabricated housing with 20 terminals 
(Premold 20).

The acceleration module is comparable  
in form with the yaw-rate sensor module 
and consists of a micromechanical mea-
suring element, an electronic evaluating 
circuit and a housing with 12 terminals 
(Premold12). The spring-mass structure is 
deflected in its sensitive axis by external 
accelerations and is evaluated by means  
of a differential capacitor in a comb-like 
form.

Sensor types  |  Piezoelectric “tuning-fork” yaw-rate sensor     259

Design
The piezoelectric "tuning fork" yaw-rate 
sensor comprises a steel element shaped 
like a tuning fork. This incorporates four 
piezo elements (two above, two below,  
Fig. 1) and the sensor electronics. The 
 tuning forks are about 15 mm long.

Operating principle
When voltage is applied, the bottom  
piezo elements start to oscillate and excite 
the upper section of the “tuning fork”, 
 together with its upper piezo elements, 
which then starts counter-phase oscillation. 
The frequency is approximately 2 kHz.

Straight-ahead driving
With the vehicle being driven in a straight 
line there are no Coriolis forces acting on 
the tuning fork, and since the upper piezo 
elements always oscillate in counter-phase 
and are only sensitive perpendicularly to 
the direction of oscillation, they do not 
generate a voltage.

Cornering
The rotational movement around the 
 vehicle’s vertical axis as it travels around  
a curve causes the upper portion of the 
tuning fork to leave the oscillatory plane 
so that an alternating voltage is generated 
in the upper piezo elements which is 
transferred to the navigation computer by 
an electronic circuit in the sensor housing. 
The voltage-signal amplitude is a function 
of both the yaw rate and the oscillation 
 velocity. Its sign depends on the direction 
(left or right) taken by the curve.

Piezoelectric “tuning-fork” 
yaw-rate sensor

Application
In order that it can use the digital road 
map stored on the CD-ROM to calculate 
the distance driven, the computer in the 
vehicle’s navigation system needs informa-
tion on the vehicle’s movements (compos-
ite navigation). 

When the vehicle is cornering, the navi-

gation system’s yaw-rate sensor records 
the vehicle’s rotation about its vertical 
axis, thus permitting determination of the 
direction of travel. The vehicle’s position 
can hence be calculated in conjunction 
with the determination of the distance 
traveled from the tachometer or wheel 
sensor signals by “composite positioning”. 
Initially in navigation systems, the vehi-

cle’s direction was determined from the 
earth’s magnetic field by a magnetic field 
sensor. However, these could easily be in-
fluenced by the magnetic interference in 
the vehicle. As oscillation gyroscopes are 
based on the measurement of mass forces, 
they are insensitive to magnetic interfer-
ence.

Micromechanical pressure sensors deter-
mine the absolute pressure of liquids and 
gases by measuring the pressure differen-
tial in relation to a reference vacuum. 

Version with the reference vacuum on 
the component side
Design
The measuring cell of a micromechanical 
pressure sensor consists of a silicon chip 
(Fig. 1a, Item 2), in which a thin diaphragm 
is micromechanically etched (1). Four 
strain-gage resistors (R1, R2), are diffused 
into the diaphragm. The electrical resis-
tance in these resistors changes in re-
sponse to mechanical elongation. The 
measuring cell is surrounded and sealed 
on its component side by a cap (Fig. 2,  
Item 6), which encloses the reference 
 vacuum underneath. 

A temperature sensor (Fig. 3, Item 1), 
the  signals of which can be evaluated inde-
pendently, can also be integrated in the 
pressure-sensor housing. 

Operating principle
The diaphragm of the sensor cell is de-
flected to varying degrees depending

of the voltages across them. This leads to  
a change in the measurement voltage UM. 
This as yet unamplified voltage is there-
fore a measure of the pressure applied  
to the diaphragm. 

The measurement voltage is higher  
with a bridge circuit than would be the 
case if an individual resistor were used. 
The Wheatstone bridge circuit thus per-
mits a higher sensor sensitivity.

The signal-conditioning electronic cir-
cuitry is integrated on the chip. Its func-
tion is to amplify the bridge voltage, com-
pensate for temperature influences, and 
linearize the pressure curve. The output 
voltage is in the range of 0 to 5 V and is 
 supplied via electrical connections to  
the engine control unit (Fig. 3, Item 5).  
The control unit uses this output voltage  
to calculate the pressure.

nent side: A silicon chip (Fig. 5, Item 6)

gage  resistors in a bridge circuit is located 
– like the pressure sensor with cap and ref-
erence vacuum on the component side –

 contrast to the sensor with the reference 
vacuum on the component side, there is  
no passage in the glass base through which 
the measured pressure can be applied to 
the sensor element. Instead, pressure is

High-pressure sensors

Application
High-pressure sensors are used in a motor 
vehicle to measure fuel pressure and 
brake-fluid pressure, e.g:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

   Rail-pressure sensor for gasoline direct 

injection (pressure up to 200 bar)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Rail-pressure sensor for common-rail 

diesel-injection system (pressure up to 
2,000 bar)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Brake-fluid pressure sensor in the 

 hydraulic modulator of the electronic 
stability program (pressure up to  
350 bar)

Design and operating principle
High-pressure sensors operate according 
to the same principle as micromechanical 
pressure sensors. The core of the sensor is 
a steel diaphragm, onto which strain-gage 
resistors have been vapor-deposited in the 
form of a bridge circuit (Fig. 6, Item 3).  
The sensor’s measuring range is depen-
dent on the thickness of the diaphragm 
(thicker diaphragms for higher pressures, 
thinner diaphragms for lower pressures). 
As soon as the pressure to be measured  
is applied to one side of the diaphragm  
via the pressure connection (4), the strain-
gage resistors change their resistance 
 values as a result of the deflection of the 
diaphragm. The output voltage generated 
by the bridge  circuit is proportional to the 
applied  pressure. This voltage is transmit-
ted via connecting lines (bonding wires)  
to an evaluation circuit (2) in the sensor. 
The evaluation circuit amplifies the bridge 
signal to 0 to 5 V and transmits it to the 
control unit, which calculates the pressure 
with the aid of a characteristic curve.

applied to the silicon chip from the side on 
which the evaluation electronics is situated. 
This means that a special gel must be used 
on this side of the sensor to protect it against 
environmental influences. The reference 
vacuum (5) is enclosed in the cavity (special 
chamber) between the silicon chip and the 
glass base. The complete measuring element 
is mounted on a ceramic hybrid (4), which 
incorporates the soldering surfaces for 
 electrical contacting inside the sensor.

A temperature sensor can also be incor-
porated in the pressure-sensor housing.  
It protrudes into the air current, and can 
therefore respond to temperature changes 
with a minimum of delay (Fig. 4, Item 4).

Operating principle
The operating principle, and with it the signal 
conditioning and signal amplification to-
gether with the characteristic curve, corre-
spond to that used in the pressure sensor with 
cap and reference vacuum on the component 
side. The only difference is that the measuring 
element’s diaphragm is deformed in the op-
posite direction and therefore the strain-gage 
resistors are “bent” in the other direction.

Temperature sensors

Application
Engine-temperature sensor
This is installed in the coolant circuit 
(Fig. 1). The engine management uses  
its signal when calculating the engine 
 temperature (measuring range  
– 40 to +130 °C).

Air-temperature sensor
This sensor is installed in the air-intake 
tract. Together with the signal from the 
boost-pressure sensor, its signal is applied 
in calculating the intake-air mass. Apart 
from this, setpoint values for the various 
control loops (e.g. EGR, boost-pressure 
control) can be adapted to the air tempera-
ture (measuring range –40 to +120 °C).

Engine-oil temperature sensor
The signal from this sensor is used in cal-
culating the service interval (measuring 
range –40 to +170 °C).

Fuel-temperature sensor
Is incorporated in the low-pressure stage 
of the diesel fuel circuit. The fuel tempera-
ture is used in calculating precisely the 
 injected fuel quantity (measuring range  
–40 to +120 °C).

Exhaust-gas temperature sensor
This sensor is mounted on the exhaust-gas 
system at points which are particularly 
critical regarding temperature. It is ap-
plied in the closed-loop control of the 
 systems used for exhaust-gas treatment.  
A platinum measuring shunt is usually 
used (measuring range –40 to +1,000 °C).

Design and operating principle
Depending upon the particular application, 
a wide variety of temperature sensor types 
are available. A temperature-dependent 
semiconductor measuring shunt is fitted 
inside a housing. This resistor is usually  
of the NTC (Negative Temperature Coeffi-
cient, Fig. 2) type. Less often a PTC (Posi-
tive Temperature Coefficient) type is used. 
With NTC, there is a sharp drop in resis-
tance when the temperature rises, and  
with PTC there is a sharp increase.

The measuring shunt is part of a voltage-
divider circuit to which 5 V is applied.  
The voltage measured across the measur-
ing shunt is therefore temperature-depen-
dent. It is supplied through an analog-digi-
tal (A/D) converter and is a measure of the 
temperature at the sensor. A characteristic 
curve is stored in the control unit which 
 allocates a specific temperature to every 
resistance or output voltage value.

Accelerator-pedal sensors

In Motronic systems with electronic throt-
tle control (ETC), the accelerator-pedal 
sensor records the travel or the angular 
position of the accelerator pedal. For this 
purpose, potentiometers are used in addi-
tion to proximity-type sensors. The accel-
erator-pedal sensor is incorporated with 
the accelerator pedal in the accelerator-
pedal module. These ready-to-install units 
make adjustments on the vehicle a thing of 
the past.

Potentiometric accelerator-pedal sensor
The engine control unit receives the mea-
sured value picked off at the potentiome-
ter wiper as a voltage. The control unit 
uses a stored sensor curve to convert this 
voltage into the relative pedal travel or the 
angular position of the accelerator pedal 
(Fig. 1).

A second (redundant) sensor is incorpo-

rated for diagnosis purposes and for use  
in case of malfunctions. It is a component 
part of the monitoring system. One sensor 
version operates with a second potentio-
meter, which always delivers half the volt-
age of the first potentiometer at all operat-
ing points. Thus, two independent signals 
are available for fault-detection purposes  
(Fig. 1). Instead of the second potentiome-
ter, another version uses a low-idle switch, 
which signals the idle position to the con-
trol unit. The status of this switch and the 
potentiometer voltage must be plausible.
For vehicles with automatic transmis-
sions, a further switch can be incorporated 
for an electrical kickdown signal. Alterna-
tively, this information can also be derived 
from the rate of change of the potentiome-
ter voltage. A further possibility is to trig-
ger the kickdown function by means of a 
defined voltage value of the sensor curve; 
here, the driver receives feedback on a jump 
in force in a mechanical kickdown cell.  
This is the most frequently used solution.

Hall angular-position sensors
Hall sensors are used to measure the move-
ment of the accelerator pedal on a non-con-
tact basis. In the case of the Type ARS1 Hall 
angular-position sensor, the magnetic flux of 
a roughly semicircular, permanent-magnetic 
disk is fed back via a pole shoe, two further 
conductive elements and the similarly 
 ferromagnetic shaft to the magnet (Fig. 2). 
 Depending upon the angular setting, the flux 
is led to a greater or lesser degree through 
the two conductive elements, in the mag-
netic path of which a Hall sensor is also situ-
ated. Using this principle, it is possible to 
achieve a practically linear characteristic 
curve in the measuring range of 90°.

The Type ARS2 is a simplified version 
which does without soft magnetic conduc-
tive elements (Fig. 3). In this version, the 
magnet moves around the Hall sensor in a 
circular arc. Only a relatively small section 
of the resulting sinusoidal characteristic 
curve features good linearity. If the Hall 
sensor is located slightly outside the cen-
ter of the circular arc, the characteristic 
curve increasingly deviates from the 
 sinusoidal, and now features a short mea-
suring range of almost 90°, and a longer 
measurement range of more than 180°  
with good linearity. A great disadvantage 
though is the low level of shielding against 
external fields, as well as the remaining 
dependence on the geometric tolerances 
of the magnetic circuit, and the intensity 
fluctuations of the magnetic flux in the 
permanent magnet as a function of tem-
perature and age.

In the case of the FPM2.3 type Hall 
 angular-position sensor, it is not the field 
strength but rather the direction of the 
magnetic field which is used to generate 
the output signal. The field lines are re-
corded by four radially arranged measur-
ing elements lying in one plane in the  
x- and y-directions (Fig. 4). The output sig-
nals are derived in the ASIC from the raw 
data (cos and sin signals) using the arctan 
function. The sensor is positioned between 
two magnets to generate a homogenous 

magnetic field. The sensor is therefore 
 insensitive to component tolerances and  
is temperature-resistant.

As with the accelerator-pedal module 
with a potentiometric sensor, these prox-
imity-type systems also contain two sen-
sors in order to receive two redundant 
voltage signals.

Steering-angle sensors

Application
The electronic stability program (ESP) 
 applies the brakes selectively to the indi-
vidual wheels in order to keep the vehicle 
on the desired track selected by the driver. 
Here, a control unit compares the steering 
angle and the applied brake pressure with 
the vehicle’s actual rotary motion (around 
its vertical axis) and its road speed. If nec-
essary, the brakes are applied at individual 
wheels. These measures serve to keep the 
float angle (deviation  between the vehicle 
axis and the actual  vehicle movement) 
down to a minimum and, until the physical 
limits are reached, prevent the vehicle 
breaking away.

Basically speaking, practically all types 

of angular-position sensors are suitable  
for registering the steering angle. Safety 
considerations, though, dictate that only 
those types are used which can be easily 
checked for plausibility, or which in the 
ideal case automatically check themselves. 
Potentiometer principles are used, as well 
as optical code-registration and magnetic 
principles. Whereas a passenger-car steer-
ing wheel turns through ±720° (a total of  
4 complete turns), conventional angular-
position sensors can only measure maxi-
mum 360°. This means that with the major-
ity of the sensors actually used for this 
purpose it is necessary to continually reg-
ister and store the data on the steering 
wheel’s actual setting.

Design and operating principle
Steering-angle sensor with AMR element 
The LWS3 steering-angle sensor uses AMR 
(Anisotropic Magnetoresistive Sensors) for 
its operation. The AMR’s electrical resis-
tance changes according to the direction  
of an external magnetic field. In the LWS3, 
the information on angle across a range  
of four complete rotations is provided by 
measuring the angles of two gear wheels 
which are rotated by a third gear wheel  
on the steering shaft. The first two gear 

wheels differ by one tooth which means 
that a definite pair of angular variables is 
associated with every possible steering-
wheel position.

By applying a mathematical algorithm  

(a computing process which follows a 
 defined step-by-step procedure) referred  
to here as a modified vernier principle, it 
is possible to use the above AMR method 
for calculating the steering angle in a mi-

These short connections enhance the 
 sensor’s robustness against external 
 interference.

The two GMR elements measure the 
direction of the field lines of the two mag-
nets. The steering angle is calculated from 
this in the microprocessor. The sensor 
element and microprocessor communicate 
via a digital interface (SPI interface).  
The calculated steering angle value is 
placed on the CAN by the microprocessor.
Because of the greater sensitivity, by 
comparison with the AMR effect, the LWS5 
can work with weaker magnets and greater 
air gaps. This brings considerable cost 
benefits in materials and design. The 360° 
angular measuring range of a single GMR 
element (a 180° measuring range is typical 
for AMR), allows the use of smaller gear 
wheels on the LWS5. It thus requires a sig-
nificantly smaller installation space than 
the LWS3. In addition, it has a significant 
level of scaleability, reflected in the mea-
suring range (±90° to ±780°) and in the de-
gree of redundancy. This means that the 
sensor can meet the specific requirements 
of the various vehicle manufacturers as 
closely as possible.

croprocessor. Here, even the measuring 
inaccuracy of the two AMR sensors can be 
compensated for. In addition, a self-check 
can also be implemented so that a highly 
plausible measured value can be sent to 
the control unit. 

Figure 1 shows the schematic represen-
tation of the LWS3 steering-angle sensor. 
The two gear wheels, with magnets inserted, 
can be seen. The sensors are located above 
them together with the evaluation elec-
tronics.

A different design is the LWS4 steering-
 angle sensor which unambiguously mea-
sures a steering angle of 180°. It is mounted 
on the shaft end of the steering axle (Fig. 3)

Steering-angle sensor with GMR element
The LWS5 is the first steering-angle sensor 
based on the GMR effect (Giant Magneto 
Resistive). Its mechanical structure and 
operating principle have been taken from 
the LWS3. The LWS3 and LWS5 are me-
chanically and electrically compatible.

The GMR layers are processed on the 
planarized surface of the evaluation circuit 
(vertical integration). The GMR resistor 
bridge and the evaluation module are con-
nected by means of plated-through holes.

be designed to be sufficiently robust as to 
be able to withstand the severe mechanical 
stresses over the service life of the vehicle. 
Surface-mounted sensors, on the other 
hand, are made in the standard packages 
familiar from engine compartment appli-
cations. They must meet the correspond-
ing requirements such as being splash-
proof and handling operating tempera-
tures from -40 to 130 °C. 

Because of the complex requirements 
(Table 1) arising from the various trans-
mission topologies, and the requirements 
on mounting space and function (safety 
concept, required precision, etc.) different 
physical measuring principles (Hall, AMR, 
GMR, eddy-current principles) and shapes 
(linear and rotary detection) may be used. 
These are explained in greater detail be-
low using the example of the Hall effect 
and the eddy current principle.

Linear position determination on the 
basis of Hall switches
Design
Four digital Hall switches are mounted on 
a printed-circuit board in such a way that 
they detect the magnetic orientation of a 
linearly displaceable, multipolar perma-
nent magnet (Fig. 1). The magnet carriage 
is coupled with the linearly actuated selec-
tor slide (hydraulic slide in the transmis-
sion control plate) or the parking lock 
 cylinder. 

In addition to the Hall switch, the 
printed-circuit board carries resistors  
to represent diagnosis functions and  
EMC  capacitors. 

The sensor electronics are protected 
against the influence of the transmission 
oil by being potted in a dense, oil-resistant 
epoxy resin.

Position sensors for 
 transmission control

Application
The position sensor detects the positions 
of an actuator (e.g. selector lever shaft, 
 selector slide or park lock cylinder) in  
AT, ASG, DKG and CVT transmissions.  
The sensors may be fitted stand-alone  
or built into electronics modules. 

Requirements
Sensors built into the transmission must 
be designed to cope with the challenging 
operating conditions prevailing there:

nents of ASIC, capacitors, resistors and

In some applications, the sensor transmits 
the controlled variable for starter release, 
the P/N signal, directly via a processor-
 independent hardware route. This in-
creases the availability in operating states 
(e.g. when the vehicle’s electrical system 
voltage is low) in which the electronic con-
trol unit would not yet be operational. 

In the case of automatic transmission 
with electronic shifting, also known as  
E-shifting, the position sensor detects  
only the positions of the park lock cylinder 
Pin and Pout and the intermediate range and 
passes these to the transmission control 
unit in the form of a 2-bit code.

Rotational position determination  
on the basis of eddy currents
Design
A position sensor with rotational design  
is shown in Figure 3. In this example, a 
specially shaped rotor with a return coil  
is mounted to rotate on the selector lever 
shaft outside the transmission. It repre-
sents the interface to the transmission 
 actuator. Redundant transmit and receive 
coils are mounted on the fixed sensor 
board with their associated evaluating 
ASICs. In this solution, the actuator (shaft) 
passes through the circuit board.

Operating principle
In the case of automatic transmission with 
manual shifting, also known as M-shifting, 
the position sensor detects the positions of 
the selector slide, P, R, N, D, 4, 3, 2 and the 
intermediate ranges and passes these to 
the transmission control in the form of a  
4-bit code (Fig. 2). For safety reasons, the 
position is encoded in one-step encoding, 
i.e. two-bit changes are always required 
before a new position is detected. Single-
bit changes caused by malfunctions can  
be detected as false by the control unit by 
plausibility considerations. The sequence 
of these bit changes corresponds to a  
Gray code.

  Sensor types  |  Position sensors for transmission control

Operating principle
The sensor uses the eddy-current princi-
ple. The transmitting coil induces in the 
return coil an eddy current opposite to its 
cause, the magnetic field of which induces 
a voltage in the receiver coils. The geome-
tries of the return coil and the receiver  
coil are tuned to one another, so that con-
tinuously changing positions of the rotor 
can be detected.

Similarly to the example of linear posi-
tion detection, the rotational position sen-
sor detects the P, R, N, D, 4, 3 and 2 posi-
tions. In this case, however, on the selector 
lever shaft projection out of the transmis-
sion. The positions of the shaft correspond 
to the positions of the selector slide inside 
the transmission. 

One benefit of analog signal condition-
ing is that the individual shift and interme-
diate ranges are assigned to the angle posi-
tions detected by the sensor in the software, 
and so can easily be adapted to transmis-
sion design variants.

3 Position sensor using eddy-current principles

For safety reasons, the sensor makes  
two independent, opposing output signals 
available, with the upper and lower 5 % 
of the signal stroke being used as a diag-
nostic range. In the event of a fault being 
detected inside the sensor, a voltage level 
in the upper diagnostic range is output. 
Faults that can occur on the transmission 
path to the control unit (e.g. open circuit 
or short-circuit) also lead to voltage levels 
in the diagnostics range. In addition to 
this, the electronic control unit tests the 
signal for plausibility by adding the two 
signals together. Sensor or transmission 
errors can be detected by the control unit 
in this way, and an appropriate emergency 
running program can be selected, depend-
ing on the fault.

Table 2 compares the two examples of 

position sensor and illustrates the com-
plexity of the topic. 

The complex requirements on the actua-

tor’s mechanical interface, the mounting 
space, the environmental influences and 
the safety concept frequently lead to appli-
cation-specific sensor system solutions.

Axle sensors

Applications 
The automatic headlamp range control 
(ALWR) adjusts the vehicle’s headlamp 
range automatically. With the headlamps 
on low beam, ALWR compensates for the 
vehicle tilt so that the driver has adequate 
vision without dazzling oncoming traffic. 
Whereas, the static ALWR compensates 
for the vehicle tilt resulting from the vehi-
cle loading, the dynamic version also takes 
into account the front-end up and down 
pitching movement of the vehicle caused 
by braking and acceleration. Here, the axle 
sensors precisely register the bodywork’s 
tilt angle. 

Design and operating principle
Axle sensors (angular-position sensors) 
are used to measure the vehicle tilt. These 
are attached to the bodywork at the front 
and rear of the vehicle. Spring compres-
sion is transmitted to the sensors by a 
pivot lever which is connected through  
a connecting rod to the particular axle  
or to the wheel suspension. The vehicle’s 
tilt is then calculated from the difference 
between the voltages of the front and rear 
axle sensors. 

The axle sensors function according  
to the Hall effect. A Hall IC is built into the 
stator (Fig. 1, Item 5) where it is located in 

a  homogenous magnetic field. The mag-
netic field generates a Hall voltage in the 
Hall IC proportional to the magnetic-field 
strength. When the ring magnet (6) is ro-
tated by the shaft (2), the magnetic field 
through the Hall IC changes accordingly. 
When the springs are compressed due 
to loading and/or acceleration/braking,  
the connecting rod (Fig. 2, Item 4) trans-
fers the spring compression movement to 
the pivot lever of the axle sensor so that it 
is converted into a voltage signal which is 
proportional to the angle of rotation.

The control unit registers the axle-sen-
sor signals and from them generates the 
difference between front and rear axle. 
 Using this voltage difference, and taking 
into account the vehicle’s speed, the con-
trol unit now calculates the setpoint value 
for the servomotor settings. With the vehi-
cle driving at constant speed, the dynamic 
ALWR remains in the status which features 
a high level of damping whereby the step-
ping motors are adapted slowly to the 
 vehicle tilt. This prevents bumps, uneven-
ness, or holes in the road causing continu-
ous correction of the headlamp settings. 
When the vehicle accelerates, or the 
brakes are applied, the system automati-
cally switches to the dynamic mode, and 
adjusts the headlamp range within a few 
milliseconds. The system then switches 
back to the slower mode.

Hot-film air-mass meters 

Application
To provide precise pilot control of the  
air-fuel ratio, it is essential for the supplied 
air mass to be exactly determined in the 
respective operating status. The hot-film 
air-mass meter measures some of the actu-
ally inducted air-mass flow for this pur-
pose. It takes into account the pulsations 
and reverse flows caused by the opening 
and closing of the engine’s intake and ex-
haust valves. Intake-air temperature or 
air-pressure changes have no effect upon 
measuring accuracy.

HFM5 design
The housing of the HFM5 hot-film air-mass 
meter (Fig. 1, Item 5) projects into a mea-
suring tube (Fig. 3, Item 6) which, depend-
ing upon the engine’s air-mass require-
ments (370 to 970 kg/h) can have a variety 
of diameters. The measuring tube normally

contains a flow rectifier, which ensures that 
the flow in the measuring tube is uniform. 
The flow rectifier is either a combination  
of a plastic mesh with straightening action 
and a wire mesh, or is a wire mesh on its own 
(Fig. 3, Item 8).The measuring tube is in-
stalled in the intake tract downstream from 
the air filter. Plug-in versions are also avail-
able which are installed inside the air filter.

The most important component parts in the 
sensor are the measuring cell (Fig. 1, Item 4) 
in the air intake (8) and the integrated evalu-
ation electronics (3). 

The sensor measuring cell consists of  
a semiconductor substrate. The sensitive 
surface is formed by a diaphragm which 
has been manufactured in micromechani-
cal processes. This diaphragm incorpo-
rates temperature-sensitive resistors.  
The elements of the evaluation electronics 
(hybrid circuit) are installed on a ceramic 
substrate. This principle permits very 
compact design. The evaluation electron-
ics are connected to the control unit by 
means of electrical connections (1). 

The partial-flow measuring passage (6) 

is shaped so that the air flows past the 
measuring cell smoothly (without swirl 
 effects) and back into the measuring tube 
via the air outlet (7). The length and loca-
tion of the inlet and outlet of the partial-
flow measuring passage have been chosen 
to provide good sensor performance even 
in the event of sharply pulsating flows. 

Operating principle
The HFM5 hot-film air-mass meter is a thermal 
sensor which operates according to the fol-
lowing principle: A centrally situated heat-
ing resistor on the measuring cell (Fig. 3, 
Item 3) heats a sensor diaphragm (5) and 
maintains it at a constant temperature.  
The temperature drops sharply on each  
side of this controlled heating zone (4). 

The temperature distribution on the dia-
phragm is registered by two temperature-
dependent resistors which are mounted 
upstream and downstream of the heating 

Sensor types  |  Hot-film air-mass meters      273

Incorrect air-mass readings will be regis-
tered if the sensor diaphragm is contami-
nated with dust, dirty water or oil. For the 
purpose of increasing the robustness of 
the HFM5, a protective device has been

resistor so as to be symmetrical to it  
(measuring points M1, M2). Without the 
flow of incoming air, the temperature 
 profile (1) is the same on each side of  
the heating zone (T1 = T2). 

As soon as air flows over the measuring 

cell, the uniform temperature profile at  
the diaphragm changes (2). On the inlet 
side, the temperature characteristic is 
steeper since the incoming air flowing  
past this area cools it off. On the opposite 
side, the temperature characteristic only 
changes slightly, because the incoming air 
flowing past has been heated by the heater 
element. The change in temperature distri-
bution leads to a temperature difference 
(∆T) between the measuring points M1 
and M2.

The heat dissipated to the air, and there-
fore the temperature characteristic at the 
measuring cell is dependent on the air mass 
flowing past. The temperature difference is 
(irrespective of the absolute temperature of 
the air flow past) a measure of the air-flow 
mass. It is also direction-dependent so that 
the air-mass meter can record both the 
amount and the direction of an air-mass 
flow.

Due to its very thin micromechanical 
 diaphragm, the sensor has a highly dy-
namic response (< 15 ms), a point which  
is of particular importance when the in-
coming air is pulsating heavily.

The evaluation electronics integrated in 
the sensor convert the resistance differen-
tial at the measuring points M1 and M2 into 
an analog voltage signal of between 0 and  
5 V. Using the sensor curve (Fig. 2) stored in 
the engine control unit, the measured volt-
age is converted into a value representing 
the air-mass flow (kg/h). 

The shape of the characteristic curve is 
such that the diagnosis facility incorporated 
in the control unit can detect such malfunc-
tions as an open-circuit line. An additional 
temperature sensor for evaluation functions 
can be integrated in the HFM5 hot-film air-
mass meter. It is not required for measuring 
the air mass.

developed which, in conjunction with a 
 deflector mesh, keeps dirty water and dust 
away from the sensor element (HFM5-CI; 
with C-shaped bypass and inner tube (I), 
which together with the deflector mesh 
protects the sensor). 

HFM6 hot-film air-mass meter
The HFM6 uses the same sensor element 
as the HFM5 and has the same basic 
 design. It differs in two crucial points:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The integrated evaluation electronics 
operate digitally in order to obtain 
greater measuring accuracy

(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The design of the partial-flow measuring 
passage is altered to provide protection 
against contamination directly upstream 
of the sensor element (similar to the de-
flector mesh in the HFM5-CI)

Digital electronics
A voltage signal is generated with a bridge 
circuit from the resistance values at the 
measuring points M1 and M2 (Fig. 3); this 
voltage signal serves as the measure of the 
air mass. The signal is converted into digi-
tal form for further processing. 

The HFM6 also takes into account the 
temperature of the intake air when deter-
mining the air mass. This increases signifi-
cantly the accuracy of the air-mass mea-
surement.

The intake-air temperature is measured  
by a temperature-dependent resistor, 
which is integrated in the closed control 
loop for monitoring the heating-zone tem-
perature. The voltage drop at this resistor 
passes through an analog-digital converter 
to give a digital signal representing the in-
take-air temperature. The signals for air 
mass and intake-air temperature are used 
to address a program map in which the 
correction values for the air-mass signal 
are stored. 

Improved protection against  
contamination
The partial-flow measuring passage is di-
vided into two sections in order to provide 
better protection against contamination 
(Fig. 4). The passage which passes the sen-
sor element has a sharp edge (1), around 
which air must flow. Heavy particulates 
and dirty-water droplets are unable to fol-
low this diversion and are separated from 
the partial flow. These contaminants exit 
the sensor through a second passage (5). 
In this way, significantly fewer dirt parti-
cles and droplets reach the sensor ele- 
ment (3) with the result that contamina- 
tion is reduced and the service life of the 
air-mass meter is significantly prolonged 
even when operated with contaminated 
air.

Mounting
In four-cylinder engines, one knock sensor 
is sufficient to record the knock signals for 
all the cylinders. Engines with more cylin-
ders require two or more knock sensors. 
The knock-sensor installation point on  
the engine is selected so that knock can  
be reliably detected from each cylinder. 
The sensor is usually bolted to the side  
of the engine block. It must be possible  
for the generated signals (structure-borne-
noise vibrations) to be introduced without 
resonance into the knock sensor from  
the measuring point on the engine block.  
A fixed bolted connection satisfying the 
following requirements is required for  
this purpose:
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  The mounting bolts must be tightened to 

a defined torque 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

engine block must comply with prespec-
ified quality requirements

Application
Regarding their principle of functioning, 
knock sensors are basically vibration sen-
sors and are suitable for detecting struc-
ture-borne acoustic oscillations. These 
 occur as “knock”, for instance, in gasoline 
engines when uncontrolled combustion 
takes place. They are converted by the 
knock sensor into electrical signals (Fig. 1) 
and transmitted to the Motronic control 
unit, which counteracts the engine knock 
by adjusting the ignition angle.

Design and operating principle
Due to its inertia, a mass (Fig. 2, Item 2) 
 excited by a given oscillation or vibration 
exerts a compressive force on a toroidal 
piezoceramic element (1) at the same 
 frequency as the excitation oscillation. 
These forces effect a charge transfer 
within the ceramic element. An electrical 
voltage is generated between the top and 
bottom of the ceramic element which is 
picked off via contact washers (5) and 
 processed in the Motronic control unit.

276     Sensor types  |  SMM acceleration sensors

SMM acceleration sensors

Application
Surface micromechanical (SMM) accelera-
tion sensors have a variety of acceleration 
detection roles in the vehicle. These in-
clude the detection of acceleration values 
for a frontal or lateral impact in order to 
trigger the seat-belt pretensioners, the air-
bag and the rollover bar in vehicle occu-
pant-protection systems. Surface micro-
mechanical (SMM) acceleration sensors 
are used in the field of active vehicle safety 
in ABS, ESP and HHC (Hill Hold Control, 
low-speed traction control) systems. Fur-
ther possible applications of acceleration 
sensors are found in chassis and suspen-
sion control (active suspension) and vehi-
cle alarm systems, where a change in the 
 vehicle tilt will trigger an alarm.

Design and operating principle
The surface micromechanical sensor ele-
ments are designed for different measur-
ing ranges, depending on the application. 
These measuring ranges lie between 1 g 
and 400 g (1 g ≈ 9.81 m/s2). The design of 
an acceleration sensor for side or frontal 
impact sensing is described below. The 
SMM sensor element is fitted together with 
the evaluation electronics (ASIC) in a first 

packaging stage (module). Figure 1 shows 
a module in a SO16 housing. This module 
on a small PCB, with further circuit com-
ponents, is pressed into the second pack-
aging stage, a plastic housing. This housing 
is closed and sealed with a welded plastic 
lid. This sensor is intended for installation 
in the side or fender of the vehicle after 
calibration and testing and sends its accel-
eration signal via plug and cable to the 
central airbag control unit. 

The functional layers of the sensor ele-
ment representing a spring-mass system 
are applied to the surface of the silicon 
 wafer by an additive method (Fig. 3, 
 surface micromechanics).

The mass with its comb-like electrodes 

(Figs. 2 and 3, Item 1) is connected via 
spring elements (2) to the anchor points 
(Fig. 3, Item 4) in the core of the sensor. 
There are fixed comb-like electrodes (3, 6) 
on the chip on each side of these movable 
electrodes. A useful capacitance in the 
range of 300 fF to 1 pF results from the 
connection in parallel of the individual 
 capacitances formed by the fixed and 
 moving electrode fingers. The two rows  
of electrode fingers connected in parallel 
result in two useful capacitances (C1 – CM 
and C2 – CM), which change in opposite di-
rections as the central mass is deflected.

 The acceleration applied to the spring-
mass system deflects it by an amount lin
-
early 
related to the acceleration applied 
 
over the spring return force. An electrical 
output signal that is linearly dependent on 
 
the acceleration is obtained by evaluation 
of this differential capacitor.

The acceleration signal obtained in 
the first stage of the evaluation circuit is 
further conditioned in the ASIC, i.e. it is 
amplified, filtered and prepared for the 
output interface.

 

Analog voltages, pulse-width-modulated 

signals, SPI protocols or current loop in
-
terfaces are usual as the output interface. 
Tolerances arising from the manufacture 
of the sensor element, the evaluation cir
-
cuit and package influences on sensitivity 
and zero point are eliminated by means of 
a comparison of programmable memory 
cells at the end of the production line. 
A self-test function tests the full mechani
cal and electrical signal path. In the course 
of this self-diagnosis, an electrostatic force 
deflects the sensor structure, i.e. simulat
-
ing an acceleration in the vehicle, and the 
response of the measurement signal is 
compared with a setpoint value. 

-

 

Up to three acceleration sensors (for ESP 
and HHC) and one or two yaw-rate sen-
sors (for ESP) are incorporated in the ESP 
sensor cluster. This clustering of sensor 
modules reduces the number of individual 
components and signal lines by compari-
son with separate sensor devices. It also 
means that fewer mountings and less in-
stallation space are needed in the vehicle.

This configuration corresponds to a series 
circuit of two capacitors C1–M and C2–M. 
 Alternating voltages are applied across 
terminals C1 and C2, and their superimpo-
sitions picked off between the capacitors 
at CM. 

In the idle condition, the capacitances 
C1–M and C2–M are ideally equal. This means 
that the difference DC is equal to zero. 
If an acceleration a is acting in the measur-
ing direction, the Si center plate (the seis-
mic mass) is caused to deflect. This causes 
a change in the distance to the upper and 
lower plates, and with it a capacitance 
change in the capacitors C1–M and C2–M 
and thus a difference DC not equal to zero. 
This leads to a change in the electrical sig-
nal at CM which is amplified and filtered in 
the evaluation electronics.

The air space between the plates allows 

effective damping with low temperature 
sensitivity.

Micromechanical bulk silicon 
acceleration sensors

Application
Micromechanical bulk silicon acceleration 
sensors detect the acceleration signals 
needed for ABS, ESP and shock absorber 
adjustment. 

This type of sensor is today predomi-
nantly used in the low acceleration ranges 
with high demands on signal to noise ratio 
(< 2 gn).

Design and operating principle
Anisotropic and selective etching tech-
niques are used to form the required 
spring-mass system for the sensor from 
the solid wafer (bulk or volume microme-
chanics). Capacitive pick-offs have proven 
especially effective for the high-precision 
measurement of this seismic-mass deflec-
tion. They require a wafer-thick silicon or 
glass plate (Fig. 1, Item 4) with counter-
electrodes, on each side of the spring-held 
mass (2). The wafers and their counter-
electrodes here also provide overload 
 protection.

2  Piezoelectric acceleration sensor (two channel

Piezoelectric acceleration 
sensors

Application
Piezoelectric spring elements are used  
as acceleration sensors in passenger-
 restraint systems for triggering the seat-
belt pretensioners, the airbags, and the 
rollover bar. 

Design and operating principle
The core of this acceleration sensor is a 
spring element (bending beam). A bonded 
structure comprising two piezoelectric 
layers of opposing polarity (bimorphous 
spring element). An acceleration acting  
on this element generates a mechanical 
tensile stress in one layer and a compres-
sive stress in the second layer (Fig. 1).

The metallized surfaces on the top and 

underneath of the spring element act  
as electrodes from which the resultant 
voltage is picked off. This structure is 
packaged together with the electronics 
 required in a hermetically sealed housing 
(Fig. 2).

The electronic circuit consists of an im-
pedance converter and a tunable amplifier 
with predefined filter characteristics.  
The design means that no static signals

iBolt™ force sensor

Applications
NHTSA FMVSS-208 (National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration; Federal 
 Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and 
 Regulations 208) came into force in the 
USA in 2004. These regulations were intro-
duced to prevent or reduce injuries to 
 children traveling in the front passenger 
seat caused by the airbag triggering. Clas-
sifying the front passenger by means of a 
weight measurement makes it possible to 
switch the airbag off selectively if a small 
child is occupying the seat. 

The BOSCH iBolt™ (intelligent bolt) 
 sensor was developed to perform this 
weight classification reliably and robustly. 
This is done by fitting four iBolts™ in the 
seat frame of the front-passenger seat  
(a sensor in each corner of the seat, Fig. 1). 
A control unit also built into the seat analy-
ses the four analog, electrical weight sig-

1  Fitting four iBolts™ in the seat base frame of the 

front passenger’s seat

nals and transmits the result of the classifi-
cation to the airbag control unit. 

Design and operating principle
The iBolt™ sensor’s operating principle  
is based on the measurement of the deflec-
tion of a bending beam caused by the pas-
senger’s weight. The amount of the deflec-
tion is detected by measurement of the 
magnetic field strength in a special Hall 
sensor/magnet configuration (Fig. 2a). 

The iBolt™ is designed such that it is the 
z component of the passenger’s weight that 
causes the deflection of the bending beam. 
The vehicle’s co-oordinates system here 
defines the x axis as the direction of travel, 
the z and y axes being perpendicular and 
horizontal to this. The configuration of the 
magnet and the Hall IC in the sensor is se-
lected such that the static magnetic field 
which penetrates the Hall IC results in an 
electrical signal linear to the deflection  
of the bending beam. The special design  
of the iBolt™ sensor prevents a horizontal 
deflection of the Hall IC in relation to the 
magnet, to minimize the influence of trans-
verse forces and moments. In addition,  
the maximum stress in the bending beam 
is limited by a mechanical overload  
stop (Fig. 2b). This protects the iBolt™, 
 especially in the event of overloads in a 
crash.

Calibration
The linear Hall sensor uses the spinning 
current measuring principle which allows 
calibration of the sensitivity, the offset and 
the temperature sensitivity of measure-
ment. The calibration data is stored in an 
EEPROM incorporated in the substrate  
for the Hall sensor.

Linearity of the output signal
A linear output signal has been achieved 
by means of a special design feature.  
The force generated by the weight of the 
front passenger is passed from the upper 
seat structure through the sleeve into the 
bending beam (Fig. 2a). The force is then

generated by the seat occupant’s position, 
which also depends on the position of the 
seat back. For this reason, the measuring 
range of the iBolt™ sensor has been de-
signed such that the forces can be detected 
in both the positive and negative z direc-
tions. This permits an unambiguous deter-
mination of the front passenger’s weight. 
Thanks to its symmetrical measuring 
range, the iBolt™ sensor detects compres-
sion and tensile forces with the same sen-
sitivity and the same tolerances. This means 
that the same sensors can be used in both 
vertical mounting orientations for all four 
points of connection between the upper 
and lower seat structures. 

passed from the bending beam into the 
lower seat structure. The bending beam 
was designed as a double bending beam  
as this has an S-shaped deformation line. 
The two vertical connection points of the 
double bending beam remain vertical over 
the entire deflection range. This guaran-
tees a linear and parallel movement of the 
Hall IC in  relation to the magnet, resulting 
in a linear output signal (Fig. 3).

Symmetrical measuring range
Tests of the system in vehicle seats have 
shown that both positive and negative 
forces can act on the sensors. This has a 
number of causes: on the one hand, nega-
tive forces can act on an individual tension 
as a result of initial tensions as a conse-
quence of tolerances in the assembly of 
the seat and of its installation in the vehi-
cle. On the other hand, negative forces 
arise on individual sensors as a function  
of the distribution of forces on the sensors

  Sensor types  |  Torque sensor

Torque sensor 

Application
Electromechanical power-assisted steering 
is increasingly being introduced in small, 
compact and medium class vehicles.  
The essential advantages are simple instal-
lation and commissioning in the vehicle, 
energy saving and the suitability of these 
systems in the vehicle’s network of control 
units for assistance systems enhancing 
comfort and safety.

Design and operating principle
In order to sense the driver command in 
electromechanical power-assisted steer-
ing, it is necessary to measure the torque 
applied by the driver. In the sensor cur-
rently in series production use for this, a 
torsion rod is fitted in the steering shaft. 
The rod is twisted by a defined amount in 
linear proportion to the torque applied  
by the driver when the driver turns the 
steering wheel (Fig. 1). This twisting can, 
for its part, be measured by suitable means 
and converted into electrical signals.  
The measuring range required for a torque 
 sensor to be used in electromechanical 
power-assisted steering is usually around 
± 8 to ± 10 Nm. The maximum angle of ro-
tation is mechanically limited by special 
components to protect the torsion rod 
against overload or destruction.

A magnetoresistive sensor is mounted 

on one side of the torsion rod to allow 
measurement of the twisting and hence  
the torque applied. This scans the field of  
a magnetic multipole wheel mounted on 
the other side. The number of poles se-
lected for this wheel is such that the sen-
sor issues an unambiguous signal within 
its maximum measuring range and thus 
makes a clear statement of the torque 
 applied at any time.

Here the magnetoresitive sensor use sup-
plies two signals over the measuring range 
which describe a sine and a cosine signal 
plotted against the angle of rotation of the 
torsion rod. The angle of rotation and 
hence of the torque is calculated in  
an electronic control unit using an arc- 
tangent function.

As there is always a fixed assignment of 
the two signals over the defined measuring 
range, a deviation from this allows faults in 
the sensor to be detected and the neces-
sary substitution measures to be intro-
duced.

A coil spring with the necessary number 
of contacts is used to provide the electrical 
contacts for the sensor over the rotational 
range of approximately ± 2 revolutions of 
the steering wheel. The power is supplied 
and the measured values are transmitted 
via this coil spring.

Sensor types  |  Rain/light sensor  

283

Design and operating principle
A rain sensor comprises an optical trans-
mission and reception path (Fig. 1). An 
LED (6) emits light at a determined angle 
into the windshield (2) which is reflected 
on the outer boundary layer (glass/play) 
(total reflection) and then is evaluated  
on an aligned receiver (photodiode, 4).  
If there is moisture on the sensitive outer 
surface, a part of the light is coupled out as 
a function of the droplet size and number, 
which attenuates the return signal. 

The integrated light sensor generally 
comprises two or three photodiodes (3, 5) 
which receive and evaluate the light com-
ing from various directions. Depending  
on the function of the light sensor, diodes 
are used that reflect the receptiveness of 
the human eye (silicon eyes) or have their 
maximum sensitivity rather in the near 
 infrared range. 

Complex filter functions and trigger 
strategies are stored in the rain/light sen-
sor. The status information derived from 
this (e.g. wiper speed 1, intermittent wiper, 
intermittent timing, lights on, lights off) 
are made available to other control units 
via a data bus (e.g. CAN, LIN).

Rain/light sensor

Application of the rain sensor
The rain sensor detects fine raindrops  
on the windshield, so that the windshield 
wipers can be triggered automatically.  
The sensor controls the speed of the wiper 
system according to the amount of rain 
measured on the windshield (intermittent, 
speed 1 and speed 2). Together with the 
electronically controlled wiper drive, 
 intermittent operation can be varied 
 infinitely. For instance, when masses of 
rain water flood the windshield when 
overtaking, the wiper is automatically 
switched to the highest wiper speed. 
 Various activation strategies are available: 
(cid:129)(cid:129)

  Permanently active
  Activated via steering column switch 
  Activation after steering column switch 

(cid:129)(cid:129)

(cid:129)(cid:129)

movement (transients)

This assistance function frees the driver 
from the other control operations used on 
conventional wiper systems. Nevertheless, 
manual control is retained as an additional 
intervention.

The rain sensor can also be used for 
other functions such as closing the win-
dows and the sliding sunroof. 

Application of the light sensor
A light sensor is also incorporated in the 
rain sensor, it may be used to control the 
low beam. This can detect the various situ-
ations (e.g. twilight, driving into and out of 
a tunnel, driving under long bridges) and 
switch the low beam on or off  accordingly. 
The light sensor can also be used to con-
trol all the lighting functions on the vehi-
cle. These functions include  adjusting the 
brightness of the instrument cluster light-
ing, “coming home leaving home” or selec-
tively switching on the rear lamps.

284     Sensor types  |  Two-step Lambda oxygen sensors

Two-step Lambda oxygen 
sensors

Application
These sensors are used in gasoline engines 
equipped with two-step Lambda oxygen 
sensor. They extend into the exhaust pipe 
between the engine’s exhaust manifold and 
the catalytic converter, and record the 
 exhaust-gas flow leaving each cylinder. 
Thanks to the Lambda oxygen sensor be-
ing heated, it can be installed further away 
from the engine so that long periods of 
full-load  engine operation are unproblem-
atical. The LSF4 sensor is also suitable for 
operation with exhaust-gas control systems 
featuring a number of sensors (for instance 
with OBDII).

Two-step Lambda oxygen sensors com-

pare the residual-oxygen content in the 
exhaust gas with the oxygen content in the 
reference atmosphere (surrounding air 
 inside the sensor) and indicate whether a 
rich (l < 1) or lean air-fuel mixture (l > 1) 
is present in the exhaust gas. The sudden 
jump in the characteristic curve of these 
sensors permits air-fuel control of l = 1 
(Fig. 1).

Operating principle
The two-step Lambda oxygen sensors op-
erate in accordance with the principle of 
the  galvanic oxygen-concentration cell 
with solid-state electrolyte (Nernst princi-
ple). The ceramic element is conductive 
for  oxygen ions from a temperature of ap-
proximately 350 °C (safe, reliable opera-
tion at >350 °C). Due to the abrupt change 
in the residual-oxygen content on the ex-
haust-gas side in the range of l = 1 (e.g. 
9 · 10–15 % vol. for l = 0.99 and 0.2 % vol. 
for l = 1.01), the different oxygen content 
on both sides of the sensor generates an 
electrical voltage between the two bound-
ary layers. This means that the oxygen 
content in the exhaust gas can be used as  
a measure of the air-fuel ratio. The inte-
grated heater  ensures that the sensor 

functions even at extremely low exhaust-
gas temperatures.

The sensor’s output voltage US is a func-

tion of the oxygen content in the exhaust 
gas. In the case of a rich air-fuel mixture 
(l,1) it reaches 800 to 1,000 mV. For a 
lean mixture (l.1), only approximately 
100 mV are generated. The transition from 
the rich to the lean area at Ureg is at about 
450 to 500 mV. 

The temperature of the ceramic element 
influences its ability to conduct the oxygen 
ions, and thus the shape of the output-volt-
age curve as a function of the excess-air 
factor l (the values in Figure 1 are there-
fore temperature-dependent). In addition, 
the response time for a voltage change 
when the mixture composition changes is 
also strongly dependent on temperature.

Whereas response times at ceramic tem-
peratures below 350 °C are in the seconds 
range, at optimum temperatures of around 
600 °C the sensor responds in less than 
50 ms. When the engine is started there-
fore, the Lambda control is switched off 
 until the minimum operating temperature 
of about 350 °C is reached. During this pe-
riod, the engine is open-loop-controlled.

Design
LSH25 finger-type sensor
Sensor ceramic element with protective tube
The solid electrolyte is a ceramic element 
which is impermeable to gas. It is a mixed 
oxide comprising the elements zirconium 
and yttrium in the form of a tube closed at 
one end (finger, Fig. 3). The surfaces have 
been provided on both sides with elec-
trodes made from a microporous, thin 
 noble-metal layer. 

The ceramic body protrudes into the 
 exhaust pipe, and the platinum electrode  
on its outside surface acts as a catalytic 
converter in miniature. Exhaust gas which 
reaches this electrode is processed cata-
lytically and brought to a stoichiometrical 
balance (l = 1). In addition, the side that is 
exposed to the exhaust gas has a porous, 
ceramic multiple layer (spinel layer) to 
protect it against contamination and

 erosive damage. The ceramic element is 
also protected against mechanical impact 
and thermal shocks by a metal tube. A 
number of slots in the protective tube are 
specially shaped so that on the one hand 
they are particularly effective against ex-
tensive thermal and chemical stresses, 
while on the other hand preventing a 
sharp drop in sensor-ceramic temperature 
when the exhaust gas is “cool”.

The sensor’s “open” inner chamber is 
connected to the surrounding air, which 
acts as a reference gas (Fig. 3). 

Sensor element with heater element and 
electrical connection
A ceramic support tube (Fig. 2, Item 2)  
and a disk spring (10) serve to locate, fix, 
and seal-off the active, finger-shaped sen-
sor ceramic in the sensor housing. A con-
tact element (6) between the support tube  
and the active sensor ceramic element 
provides the contact between the inner 
 electrode and the connection cable. 

The outer electrode is connected to the 
sensor housing by the metal sealing ring. 

The sensor’s complete internal structure is 
located and held in place by a protective 
metal sleeve (7) which at the same time 
acts as the support for the disk spring.  
The protective sleeve also guards against 
contamination of the sensor’s interior.  
The connecting cable is crimped to the 
contact element which protrudes from the 
sensor, and is protected against moisture 
and mechanical damage by a temperature-
resistant cap.

The tube-type (finger) Lambda oxygen 
sensor is also equipped with an electrical 
heater element. This ensures that the ce-
ramic-element temperature remains suffi-
ciently high, even at low engine load and 
thus low exhaust-gas temperature.

This external heating is so quick that  
the sensor reaches operating temperature 
20 to 30 s after the engine has started and 
therefore Lambda control can come into 
operation. Finally, sensor heating provides 
for an optimal ceramic-element operating 
temperature above the operating limit of 
350 °C and thus ensures low and stable 
 exhaust-gas emissions.

It is integrated and insulated in the ce-
ramic wafer and ensures that the sensor 
heats up quickly even in the event of low 
power input.

The reference-air channel inside the  
LSF4 Lambda oxygen sensor – operating  
as a reference-gas sensor (Figs. 5 and 6) – 
has access to the ambient air. This enables 
it to compare the residual oxygen content 
of the exhaust gas with the oxygen content 
of the reference gas. In other words, with 
the air inside the sensor. This means that 
the sensor voltage also features a charac-
teristic jump in the case of the planar sen-
sor, in the area of stoichiometric air-fuel 
mixture (l = 1) (Fig. 1).

LSF4 planar Lambda oxygen sensor
Regarding their function, planar Lambda 
oxygen sensors correspond to the heated 
finger sensors with their voltage-jump 
curve at l = 1. On the planar sensor 
though, the solid-state electrolyte is 
 comprised of a number of individual 
 laminated foils stacked one on top of the 
other (Fig. 4). The sensor is protected 
against thermal and mechanical influ- 
ences by a double-walled protective tube.
The planar ceramic element (measuring 

cell and heater are integrated) is shaped 
like a long stretched-out wafer with rect-
angular cross-section. 

The surfaces of the measuring cell are 
provided with a microporous noble-metal 
layer, which also has a porous ceramic 
layer on the exhaust-gas side to protect  
it against the erosive effects of the ex-
haust-residues. The heater is a wave-
shaped element containing noble metal.

LSU4 planar wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor

Application
As its name implies, the wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor is used across a 
very extensive range to determine the 
 oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas. 
The figures provided by the sensor are an 
indication of the air-fuel ratio in the com-
bustion chamber. The excess-air factor l 
is used when defining the air-fuel ratio.

The sensor projects into the exhaust pipe 
and registers the exhaust-gas mass flow 
from all cylinders. Wide-band Lambda ox-
ygen sensors make precise measurements 
not only at the stoichiometric point l = 1, 
but also in the lean range (l>1) and in the 
rich range (l<1). In combination with con-
trol electronics, these sensors generate an 
unmistakable, continuous electrical signal 
in the range from 0.7 < l < ` (air with 21 % 
O2) (Fig. 3). This means that the wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor can be used not 
only in engine-management systems with 
two-step control (l=1), but also in control 
concepts with rich and lean air-fuel mix-
tures. This type of Lambda oxygen sensor 
is therefore also suitable for Lambda con-
trol with lean-burn concepts on gasoline 
engines, as well as for diesel engines, gas-

powered engines and gas-powered central 
heaters and water heaters (hence the Ger-
man designation LSU: Lambda-Sonde-Uni-
versal = universal Lambda oxygen sensor).
In a number of systems, several Lambda 

oxygen sensors are installed for even 
greater accuracy. Here, for instance, they 
are fitted upstream and downstream of the 
catalytic converter as well as in the indi-
vidual exhaust tracts (cylinder banks).

Design
The LSU4 wide-band Lambda oxygen sen-
sor (Fig. 2) is a planar dual-cell current-
limit sensor. It features a measuring cell 
(Fig. 1) made of zirconium-dioxide ceramic 
(ZrO2), and is a combination of a Nernst 
concentration cell (sensor cell which func-
tions in the same way as a two-step Lambda 
oxygen sensor) and an oxygen pump cell 
for transporting the oxygen ions. The oxy-
gen-pump cell (Fig. 1, Item 8) is so ar-
ranged with respect to the Nernst concen-
tration cell (7) that there is a 10 to 50 µm 
diffusion gap (6) between them. Here, there 
are two porous platinum  electrodes: one 
pump electrode and one Nernst measuring 
electrode. The diffusion gap is connected 
to the exhaust gas by way of a gas-access 
passage (10). A porous diffusion barrier 
(11) serves to limit the flow of oxygen mol-
ecules from the exhaust gas.

On the one side, the Nernst concentration cell 
is connected to the atmosphere by a refer-
ence-air channel (5), on the other it is con-
nected to the exhaust gas in the diffusion gap.
The sensor requires control-electronics 
circuitry to generate the sensor signal and 
to regulate the sensor temperature. 

An integral heater (3) heats up the sensor 
quickly so that it soon reaches its operating 
temperature of 650 to 900 °C needed for 
generating a usable signal. This function de-
cisively reduces the effects that the exhaust-
gas temperature has on the sensor signal.

Operating principle
The exhaust gas enters the actual measur-
ing chamber (diffusion gap) of the Nernst 
concentration cell through the pump cell’s 
small gas-access passage. In order that the 
excess-air factor l can be adjusted in the 
diffusion gap, the Nernst concentration 
cell compares the gas in the diffusion gap 
with that in the reference-air channel. 

The complete process proceeds as fol-

lows: by applying the pump voltage UP 
across the pump cell’s platinum elec-
trodes, oxygen from the exhaust gas can be 
pumped through the diffusion barrier and 
into or out of the diffusion gap. With the 
help of the Nernst concentration cell, an 
electronic circuit in the control unit con-

trols the voltage (UP) across the pump cell 
in order that the composition of the gas in 
the diffusion gap remains constant at l = 1. 
If the exhaust gas is lean, the pump cell 
pumps the oxygen to the outside (positive 
pump current). On the other hand, if the 
 exhaust gas is rich, the oxygen (due to the 
decomposition of CO2 and H2O at the ex-
haust-gas electrode) is pumped from the 
surrounding exhaust gas and into the diffu-
sion gap (negative pump current). At l = 1, 
no oxygen needs to be transported, and the 
pump current is zero. The pump current  
is proportional to the exhaust-gas oxygen 
concentration and is this a nonlinear mea-
sure for the excess-air factor l (Fig. 3).

Electric Actuators

Actuators (final-control elements) form 
the interface between the electronic sig-
nal processor (data processing) and the 
actual process (mechanical motion). They 
convert the low-power signals conveying 
the positioning information into operat-
ing signals of an energy level adequate for 
process control. Signal transducers are 
combined with amplifier elements to ex-
ploit the physical transformation princi-
ples governing the inter relation ships be-
tween various forms of energy (electrical – 
mechanical – fluid – thermal).

Electromechanical actuators

This type of energy conversion represents 
one option for classifying electromechani-
cal actuators. The energy emanating from 
the source is transformed into magnetic  
or electrical field energy, or converted to 
thermal energy. The individual force-gen-
eration principle is determined by these 
forms of energy, and is based on either 
field forces or certain specific material 
characteristics. Magnetostrictive materials 
make it possible to design actuators for ap-
plications in the micropositioning range. 
This category also includes piezoelectric 
actuators, which are built according to a 
multilayer design similar to ceramic ca-
pacitors, and are actuators for high-speed 
fuel injectors. Thermal actuators depend 
exclusively on the exploitation of charac-
teristics of specific materials.

Actuators in a motor vehicle are mostly 
electromagneto-mechanical converters and, 
by extension, electrical servomotors, trans-
lational, and rotational solenoid actuators.

An exception is the pyrotechnic airbag 
 system. The solenoid actuators can them-
selves be the servo element, or they can 
assume a control function by governing  
a downstream amplifier (e.g. mechanical-
 hydraulic).

Force generation in the magnetic field
The distinction between the electrody-
namic and the electromagnetic actuator 
principles stems from the manner in which 
forces are generated in the magnetic field. 
Common to both principles is the magnetic 
circuit with soft-magnetic material and the 
coil for excitation of the magnetic field.  
A major difference lies in the force which 
can be extracted from the unit under tech-
nically feasible conditions. Under identical 
conditions, the force produced by applica-
tion of the electromagnetic principle is 
greater by a factor of 40. The electrical 
time constant for this type of actuator is 
comparable to the mechanical time con-
stants. Both force-generation principles 
are applied in linear and rotary drive 
mechanisms.

Electrodynamic principle
The electrodynamic principle is based  
on the force exerted on moving charges  
or charged conductors (Fig. 3a, current I) 
within a magnetic field (Lorentz force).  

3 Electrodynamic and electromagnetic converters

A field coil or a permanent magnet gener-
ates a DC magnetic field (magnetic flux 
density B). The electrical energy destined 
for conversion is applied (current I ) to the 
moving armature coil (immersion coil).  
A high degree of actuator precision is 
achieved by designing the armature coil 
with low mass and low inductance. The 
two energy accumulators (one on the fixed 
and one on the moving component) pro-
duce two active force directions via cur-
rent-direction reversal in the armature 
and field coils.

The secondary field produced by the 
 armature current flows in an open mag-
netic circuit, thereby diminishing the ef-
fects of saturation. Approximately speak-
ing, the force (torque) exerted by an elec-
trodynamic actuator over its setting range 
is proportional to current and indepen-
dent of travel.

Electromagnetic principle
The electromagnetic principle exploits  
the mutual attraction displayed by soft  
iron materials in a magnetic field. The elec-
tromagnetic actuator is equipped with only 
one coil, which generates both the field 
 energy and the energy to be transformed. 
In accordance with the operating princi-
ples, the field coil is equipped with an iron 
core to provide higher inductance.

However, as the force is proportional to  
the square of the magnetic flux density B, 
the unit is operative in only a single force-
transfer direction. The electromagnetic 
 actuator thus requires a return element 
(such as a mechanical spring or a magnetic 
return mechanism).

Dynamic response
The dynamic response of an electrome-
chanical actuator, i.e. the activation and 
deactivation operations, is defined by the 
equation of mechanical motion, the differ-
ential equation of electrical circuits and 
Maxwell’s equations of dynamics. The 
current- and position-dependent force 
follows from Maxwell’s equations.

The most basic electrical circuit con-
sists of an inductance with an ohmic re-
sistor. One means of enhancing the dy-
namic response is through over-excitation 
at the  instant of activation, while deacti-
vation can be accelerated by a Zener di-
ode, for example. In each case, increasing 
the dynamic response of the electric cir-
cuit involves additional expenditure and 
increased losses in the actuator’s trigger-
ing electronics.

Field diffusion is a delay effect which  
is difficult to influence in actuators with 
high dynamic response. Rapid switching 
operations are accompanied by high- 
frequency field fluctuations in the soft-
magnetic material of the actuator’s mag-
netic circuit. These fluctuations, in turn, 
induce eddy currents, which counteract 
their cause (build-up and decay of the 
magnetic field). The resultant delay in 
the build-up or reduction of forces can 
only be reduced by selecting appropriate 
materials with low electric conductivity 
and permeability.

Design
Design selection is essentially determined 
by operating conditions (i.e. installation 
space, required force/travel characteristic 
curve, and dynamic response).

Electromagnetic actuators
A typical form for translational electro-
magnetic actuators is the switching sole-
noid (Fig. 4) with a force/travel character-
istic curve which falls as a function of the 
square of positioning travel. The precise 
shape of the curve (Fig. 5) is determined 
by the type of working air gap (e.g. conical 
or solenoid armature).

Rotational electromagnetic actuators are 
characterized by a defined pole arrange-
ment in stator and rotor. When current is 
applied to one of the coils, the rotor and 
stator poles respond with mutual attrac-
tion, and in doing so generate a torque.

The single-winding rotary actuator (Fig. 6) 
incorporates a pair of poles in each of the 
two main sections, as well as a coil in the 
stator. Its maximum adjustment range is 
approx. 45°.

The torque motor (Fig. 7) is a bidirectional 
electromagnetic rotary actuator featuring 
a stable operating point and without coun-
terforces. The rotor is maintained in a sta-
ble position by the excitation field of the 
permanent magnet in the stator. The mag-
netic field generated by one or two stator 
windings produces torque and provides 
unilateral compensation for the excitation 
field. This type of layout is suitable for 
 applications in which substantial torque  
is required over small control angles.  
The  relationship between the applied 
 current and the torque motor’s force is 
roughly linear (Fig. 8). The torque-motor 
principle is also employed in translational 
actuators.

Electrodynamic actuators
In a pot magnet (immersion-coil actuator,  
Fig. 9) a cylindrical immersion coil (arma-
ture coil) is set in motion in a working air 
gap. The adjustment range is limited by the 
axial length of the armature coil and by the 
air gap.

The short-stroke linear motor (Fig. 10) is 
an actuator with a virtually round disk coil.

A distinction is made between single-wind-
ing and dual-winding rotary actuators  
(Fig. 11). Both types include a permanent 
magnet within the rotor and one or two 
 stator windings. The rotor magnet is mag-
netized at both ends to produce magnetic 
flux density in the rotary magnet’s working 
air gap, which combines with the armature 
current to produce a torque. Originating 
from the position illustrated, the adjust-
ment range is less than ±45°. The setting 
range of the single-winding rotary actuator 
also varies according to both the torque 
 requirement and the angle range in which 
the necessary flux density can be provided.

The dual-winding rotary actuator can be 
described as a combination of two single-
winding rotary actuators with a 90° pe-
ripheral offset and designed to produce 
opposed torque flows. A stable operating 
point is achieved at the zero transition 
point on the resulting torque curve with-
out auxiliary counterforces.

Application
Electromechanical actuators are direct-
 action control elements, and without an 
 intermediate ratio-conversion mechanism, 
they convert the energy of the electrical 
control signal into a mechanical position-
ing factor/work. Typical applications in-
clude positioning of flaps, sleeves, and 
valves. The described actuators are final-
control elements without internal return 
mechanisms, i.e. without a stable operat-
ing point. They are only capable of carry-
ing out positioning operations from a 
 stable initial position (operating point) 
when a counterforce is applied (e.g.  
return spring and electrical control). 

A solenoid armature provides a stable 
static operating point when its force/travel 
curve is superimposed on the characteris-
tic response of a return spring. A variation 
of the coil current in the solenoid shifts  
the operating point. Simple positioning  
is achieved by controlling the current. 
However, particular attention must be  
paid here to the nonlinearity of the force-
current characteristic and the positioning 
 system’s sensitivity to interference factors 
(e.g. mechanical friction, pneumatic, and 
hydraulic forces). The temperature sensi-
tivity of the coil resistance results in posi-
tioning errors, making corrective current 
control necessary. A high-precision posi-
tioning system with good dynamic response 
must incorporate a position sensor and a 
controller.

Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators utilize 
similar principles for the conversion and 
regulation of energy. Table 1 shows the 
 differences in characteristics and applica-
tions.

In most applications, fluid-mechanical 
actuator drives are in the form of hydro-
static energy converters. These operate 
according to the displacement principle, 
converting the pressure energy of the  
fluid medium into mechanical work and 
vice versa (Fig. 14).

In contrast, hydrodynamic transformers 
operate by converting flow energy (kinetic 
energy of the moving fluid) into mechani-
cal work (example: hydrodynamic clutch).
Losses during energy conversion stem 
from leakage and friction. Fluid-thermal 
losses are caused by flow resistance, in 
which throttle action transforms the hy-
draulic energy into heat. A portion of this 
heat is dissipated into the environment, 
and some of it is absorbed and carried 
away by the fluid medium:
Qheat  =  Q1 · p1  –  Q2 · p2

With incompressible fluids:
Qheat  =  Q1 · (p1  –  p2)

The flow develops into turbulence at re-
strictions. The flow rate of the fluid is then 
largely independent of viscosity. On the 
other hand, viscosity does play a role in 
the case of laminar flow in narrow pipes 
and apertures.

Fluid-mechanical amplifiers control  
the conversion of energy from fluid to 
 mechanical state. The regulating mecha-
nism must be designed for control with 
only a very small proportion of the energy 
flow required for the ultimate positioning 
operation.

Switching valves open and close the 
 orifice governing the flow to and from  
a fluid-mechanical energy converter  
(Fig. 15). Provided that the control-ele-
ment opens sufficiently, the throttling 
losses remain negligible. Pulse-width-
modulated opening and closing can be 
 applied to achieve quasi-continuous con-
trol of the fluid-mechanical energy con-
version process with virtually no losses.  
In practice, however, pressure fluctuations 
and mechanical contact between the valve 
elements result in undesirable vibration 
and noise.

Electrical machines

Electrical machines are used to convert 
electrical and mechanical energy. An elec-
tric motor converts electrical energy into 
mechanical energy, and an alternator con-
verts energy in the opposite direction. 
 Electrical machines (Fig. 16) consist of a 
stationary component (the stator) and a ro-
tating component (the rotor or armature). 
There are special designs which  depart 
from this configuration, such as  linear 
 machines which produce linear  motion.
Permanent magnets or several coils 
(windings) are used to produce magnetic 
fields in the stator and rotor. This causes 
torque to develop between the two ma-
chine components. Electrical machines 
have iron stators and rotors in order to 
control the magnetic fields. As the mag-
netic fluxes change over time, stators and 
rotors must consist of stacks of individual 
laminations which are insulated with re-
spect to one another (to minimize eddy-
current losses). 

The spatial arrangement of the coils  
and the type of current used (direct cur-
rent, alternating current, or three-phase 
current) permit a number of different elec-
trical machine designs. They differ from 
one another in the way they operate, and 
therefore have different applications.

16 Layout of an electrical machine

Direct-current machines
The stator of a direct-current machine 
contains salient poles which are magne-
tized by the direct-current excitation 
windings. In the rotor (here also called  
the armature), the coils are distributed 
among slots in the laminated iron core  
and connected to a commutator. Carbon 
brushes in the stator housing wipe against 
the commutator as it rotates, thereby 
transferring direct current to the armature 
coils. The rotary motion of the commutator 
causes a reversal in the direction of cur-
rent flow in the coils. The different rota-
tional speed vs. torque characteristics re-
sult from the method selected for connect-
ing the excitation winding and armature.

Asynchronous machines
The laminated rotor contains either a 
three-phase winding, as in the stator, or a 
rod winding. The three-phase winding is 
connected to sliprings which are short-cir-
cuited either directly or via series resistors 
(Fig. 19). In the case of the rod winding, 
the bars are connected to one another by 
two short-circuiting rings (squirrel-cage 
rotor). As long as the rotational speed of 
the rotor deviates from n0, the rotating 
 stator field induces current in the rotor 
windings, thereby generating torque. 
 Deviation of the rotational speed of the 
 rotor n from n0 is termed slip s:
s = (n0 − n) / n0

Continuous-running operation is only 
 economical in the vicinity of n0 because 
losses increase as slip increases (nominal 
slip ≤ 5%). In this range the asynchronous 
machine has a shunt characteristic. The 
machine operates as a motor when n < n0, 
and as an alternator when n > n0. The di-
rection of rotation is changed by reversing 
two of the phases.

The asynchronous machine is the most 
frequently used electric motor in the field 
of drive engineering. With a squirrel-cage 
rotor it is easy to operate, and requires 
 little maintenance.

cage rotor

b

A shunt characteristic can also be obtained 
by using a separate power supply for the 
excitation winding (external excitation)  
or by using permanent-magnet excitation 
in the stator. 

Applications for permanent-field motors 

in motor vehicles: starter, windshield 
wiper, and low-power motors for various 
drives. 

If the motor incorporates both series and 
shunt excitation windings (compound-
wound motor), intermediate levels in the 
rotational speed/torque characteristic  
can be obtained. 

Application: e.g. large starters.

All direct-current machines are easily ca-
pable of speed control over a wide range. 
If the machine incorporates a static con-
verter which allows adjustment of the ar-
mature voltage, the torque and therefore 
the rotational speed are infinitely variable. 
The rotational speed can be further in-
creased by reducing the excitation current 
(field weakening) when the rated armature 
voltage is reached. A disadvantage of di-
rect-current machines is carbon-brush 
and commutator wear which makes regu-
lar maintenance necessary.

Three-phase machines
A three-phase winding is distributed 
among the stator slots in a three-phase 
machine. The three phases of current 
 produce a rotating magnetic field.  
The speed n0 (in rpm) of this rotating  
field is calculated as follows:

n0 = 60 ⋅ f / p

f = frequency (in Hz)  
p = number of pole pairs

nous or asynchronous, depending on rotor 
design.

Synchronous machines
In the rotor (here, also called the pole 
wheel), the poles are magnetized by di-
rect-current coils. The excitation current  
is usually transferred via two sliprings to 
the rotor. The pole wheel can be made of 
solid steel, because the magnetic flux re-
mains constant over time. Constant torque 
is generated as long as the rotor rotates at 
a speed of n0. At other speeds, the torque 
fluctuates periodically between a positive 
and a negative maximum value, and exces-
sively high current is produced. For this 
reason, a synchronous machine is not self-
starting. The synchronous machine also 
differs from the asynchronous machine  
in that the reactive power absorption and 
generation are adjustable. 

The synchronous machine is most fre-
quently used as a generator of energy sup-
ply in electric power plants. Synchronous 
motors are used in cases where constant 

motor speed based on constant line fre-
quency is desired, or where a reactive 
power demand exists. The automotive 
three-phase alternator is a special type  
of synchronous machine.

The rotational speed of all three-phase 
machines is determined by the stator fre-
quency. Such machines can operate over  
a wide range of speeds if used in conjunc-
tion with static converters which vary the 
frequency.

EC motors
The “electronically commutated direct-
current” or “EC” motor is becoming in-
creasingly popular (Fig. 21). It is essen-
tially a permanent-magnet synchronous 
machine, and is brushless. The EC motor  
is equipped with a rotor-position sensor, 
and is connected to the DC power source 
through its control and power electronics. 
The electronic transfer circuit switches the 
current in the stator winding according to 
rotor position – the magnets which induce 
the excitation current are attached to the 
rotor – to provide the interdependence be-
tween rotational speed and torque which 
is normally associated with a separately 
excited direct-current machine. The re-
spective magnetic functions of the stator and 
rotor are the opposite of what they would be 
in a classical direct-current machine.

The EC motor’s potential applications 
are a result of the advantages which this 
drive principle provides: commutator and 
carbon brushes are replaced by electron-
ics, dispensing with both brush noise and 
wear. EC motors are maintenance-free 
(long service life) and can be constructed 
to meet high degrees of protection. The 
electronic control feature makes it easy  
for drive units with EC motors to incorpo-
rate auxiliary functions such as infinitely 
variable speed governing, direction rever-
sal, soft starts, and antilock protection.

The main areas of automotive application 
are in the HVAC (Heating/Ventilation/Air-
Conditioning) sectors, and for pumps and 
servo units. In the area of production ma-
chinery, EC motors are chiefly employed 
as precision drive units for feed-control  
in machine tools. Here the decisive advan-
tages are freedom from maintenance, 
 favorable dynamic properties and consis-
tent torque output with minimal ripple.

Single-phase alternating-current 
 machines
Universal motors
The direct-current series-wound motor 
can be operated on alternating current if  
a laminated rather than a solid iron stator 
is used. It is then called a universal motor.
When operated on alternating current,  
a torque component at twice the frequency 
of the current is superposed on the con-
stant torque component.

Single-phase asynchronous motors  
with squirrel-cage rotor
The simplest design of a single-phase 
asynchronous motor is a three-phase 
asynchronous machine in which alternat-
ing current is supplied to only two stator 
phases. Although its operation remains 
largely the same, the power and the maxi-
mum torque are reduced. In addition,  
the single-phase asynchronous machine  
is not self-starting.

Machines which are intended only for 
single-phase operation have only a single-
phase main winding in the stator, as well  
as auxiliary starting circuits. The stator 
also contains an auxiliary winding con-
nected in parallel with the main winding 
for this purpose. The necessary phase dis-
placement of the auxiliary winding current 
can be achieved through increased wind-
ing resistance (low breakaway torque) or 
by means of a capacitor connected in se-
ries with the auxiliary winding (somewhat 
greater breakaway torque).

The auxiliary winding is switched off 
 after the motor starts. The direction of ro-
tation of the motor is changed by reversing 
the two auxiliary or main winding connec-
tions. A motor which has a capacitor in 
 series with the auxiliary winding is called 
a capacitor motor. Capacitor motors with  
a starting and running capacitor also oper-
ate continuously with capacitor and auxil-
iary winding. Optimum operation for a 
specific operating point can be achieved 
by correct selection of capacitor. An addi-
tional capacitor is often used in order to 
increase the starting torque; this capacitor 
is then disconnected after the motor starts.

 output) of sufficient duration to reach  
the thermal steady-state condition.

S2: Short-time-duty type
Operation under constant load is so brief 
that the thermal steady-state condition  
is not reached. The rest period is so long 
that the machine is able to cool down to 
the temperature of the coolant.

Recommended short-time-duty types: 

10, 30, 60 and 90 min.

S3 to S5: Intermittent-periodic duty
Continuous alternating sequence of load 
and idle periods. The thermal steady-state 
condition is not reached during the load

15, 25, 40 and 60 %. For S2, S3 and S6, the 
operating time or the duty cycle time and 
the switch-on duration are to be specified 
after the rating; the duty cycle time is only 
to be specified if it differs from 10 mins. 
Example: S2 – 60 mins, S3 – 25 %.

Relative switch-on duration
The relative switch-on duration is the ratio 
of the loading period, including starting 
and braking, to the cycle time.

The mean temperature t2 of the windings 
of an electrical machine can be determined

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Application, Function, and Requirements

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Electrohydraulic actuators form the interface
between electrical signal processing (data
processing) and the system process (mechan-
ics). They convert the low-power command
signals into an actuating force with the in-
creased power required for the process.

Application and Function

The transmission types most commonly in
use today (AT, CVT, AST) are equipped with
actuators to perform the most varied of
functions. Table 1 provides an overview of
the most important applications and high-
lights the link between the transmission
functions and the actuator types that can be
used.

The actuators are important switching and
control elements in an electrohydraulic trans-
mission-control system. They control the oil
(fluid) flow and the pressure characteristics in
the hydraulic control plate. The following dif-
ferent actuator types are available:
1. On/off solenoid valves
2. Pulse-width modulated 

(on/off, o/o)

solenoid valves 
3. Pressure regulators 

(spool-type) 

4. Pressure regulators 
(flat-seat-type) 

(PWM)

(PR-S)

(PR-F)

In most automatic transmissions, these
 actuators currently serve as pilot-control
 elements, whose outlet pressure or volum etric
flow is boosted in the hydraulic  control plate
before operating the clutches. In contrast, di-
rect-action control elements without this
boosting facility supply the clutches with suit-
ably high pressure and volumetric flow.

Requirements

The installation location (on the transmission
inside the oil pan) gives rise to far-reaching
requirements and demanding operating con-
ditions for the actuators that are used. Figure
1 provides a summary of these requirements.
As ever more transmissions are now being
filled with lifetime oil (i.e., they do not need
to have their oil changed) abrasion and dirt
particles from breaking-in remain in the oil
system throughout the entire operation of the
transmission. Even central intake filters and
individual filters on the actuators can only re-
tain particles over a specific size.  Excessively
fine filters would soon clog up.

In addition to these considerations, the
working life of transmissions is being increas-
ingly extended: Transmissions in  standard pas-
senger cars are now expected to last at least
250,000 km (155,000 miles), and much more
for taxis and similar applications.

In contrast to many other electromagnets
(e.g. in ABS valves), actuators used in trans-
mission-control applications must be designed
over the entire temperature range for 100%

ON time, because, for example, they have to
maintain the pressure while the gear is held or
control a torque converter lockup clutch dur-
ing driving. This creates a need to limit the
power loss and to implement copper windings
of suitably generous dimensions.

Vehicle and transmission-specific function
characteristics (switching performance, con-
trol response, technical characteristic data),
electrical and hydraulic interfaces  tailored to
individual applications, and the drive towards
miniaturization and reducing costs are fur-
ther boundary conditions for developing ac-
tuators for transmission- control applications.

PWM switching valves are suitable because
of their pulse-width-modulated input signal
(constant-frequency current, variable ratio of
ON to OFF time) for use as pressure actua-
tors, whose outlet pressure is proportional or
inversely proportional to the pulse duty fac-
tor. The characteristic curve is referred to as
rising or falling.

Pressure-control valves finally are operated

with a controlled input current and can
 likewise be designed with a rising or falling
characteristic. These valves are activated
by analog means whereas PWM valves are
 activated digitally.

Design and 
Operating Concept

Automatic transmissions require switching
valves for the simple on/off switching opera-
tions and/or proportional valves for infinitely
variable pressure control. Figure 2 shows dif-
ferent ways of converting an input signal
(current or voltage) into an output signal
(pressure). Basically, actuators can be
 designed with proportional or inversely
 proportional performance characteristics.

On/off valves are usually voltage-controlled,

i.e., the battery voltage is applied to the cop-
per winding. The hydraulic section of the
valve is designed as either a normally closed
contact (n.c.) or as a normally open contact
(n.o.).

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Actuator Types

Actuator Types

Overview
The following types are examples of actuators
commonly used for transmission-control
purposes together with their characteristic
values and features (overview, Figure 1). The
examples are pilot-control actuators which
operate within a pressure range of 400 to ap-
prox. 1000 kPa and act on a booster element
in the transmission’s hydraulic  control sys-
tem. Spool plungers in the  hydraulic control
system boost the pressure and/or the volu-
metric flow.

The actuators described can be designed in
any concrete application at their interfaces in
line with the conditions in the trans mission,
e.g.
(cid:3) mechanically (mounting),
(cid:3) geometrically (installation area),
(cid:3) electrically (contacting), or
(cid:3) hydraulically (interface to control plate).

The function data must be constructively
adapted to the requirements in the trans -
mission, particularly with regard to
(cid:3) feed pressure and
(cid:3) dynamics (i.e., reaction speed and control

stability).

On/Off Solenoid Valves
On/off solenoid valves (Figure 2) are most
commonly used as simple 3/2 valves (3 hy-
draulic ports/2 positions). They are clearly
simpler in design than the 4/3-valves more
commonly found in stationary hydraulics,
and are therefore inexpensive. Nor do they
have the drawbacks of 2/2 valves (such as
high leakage or limited flow rate, necessitated
by their action in combination with an exter-
nal restrictor).

On/off solenoid valves are mainly used in
simple 3-speed or 4-speed transmissions
without overlap control. However, they are
being used increasingly less in progressive or
complex transmission-control systems (possi-
bly still for safety functions). A pressure regu-
lator controls the gearshift.

In the 3/2 switching valve (n.o.) depicted in
Figure 3, the feed pressure pfeed generated by
the transmission pump is applied before the
flange (P) and seals the ball seat. This feature
is referred to as self-sealing. Since no pressure
is applied at zero current in the working-
pressure channel (A), the valve is closed at
zero current.

In this state, the working pressure, which in
the end supplies the consumer (e.g. a clutch),
is directly connected to the return line to the
tank (oil pan) so that a pressure that is ap-
plied there can reduce or an oil  volume con-
tained therein can drain.

When current is applied to the switching-
valve winding, the magnetic force generated
reduces the working air gap, and the arma-
ture moves with its permanently connected
push rod towards the ball and opens it. Oil
flows to the consumer (from P to A) and
builds up the pump pressure there. The
 return line to the tank is closed off at the
same time.

Figure 4 shows the characteristic of the 3/2
switching valve with the pressure switching
cycles.

A switching valve of this type offers the
 following features:
(cid:3) low costs,
(cid:3) non-susceptible to dirt and  contamination,
(cid:3) low leakage, and
(cid:3) simple actuation electronics.

Areas of application for On/off switching
valves are:

(cid:3) Gear change

with multiple use of the same main
 pressure regulator.

(cid:3) Safety functions

e.g. hydraulic disabling of the reverse gear
during forward travel.

(cid:3) Torque converter lockup clutch

Cutting in and out (often controlled with a
PWM valve or pressure regulator for econ-
omy or convenience reasons).

(cid:3) Changeover of register pump

Selected for two different flow-rate ranges
via o/o (mainly for CVT transmissions).

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Actuator Types

PWM Valves
PWM valves (Figure 5) have essentially the
same design as switching valves. Since they
operate with a frequency of 30...100 Hz, they
must be designed for a higher switching
speed (dynamics) and higher mechanical load
(wear). The latter is particularly applicable if
a PWM valve is used for main-pressure con-
trol and is operated throughout the life of the
vehicle.

PWM valve (view and oil flow)

These requirements are reflected in the
 design. The sectional view in Figure 6 shows
the incorporation of a rim on the armature,
which ensures a high magnetic force and
a high hydraulic damping action when
 closing. The relatively long push rod absorbs
pulse forces. An annular seat seals the feed
pressure in the zero-current state shown
against the working-pressure channel. 

Compared with the ball seat, the advantage
of this type is that the feed pressure acts only
on minimal surface areas. These surfaces are
still pressure-compensated to the greatest ex-
tent, i.e., the applied feed pressure has an
opening and closing effect such that essen-
tially the compression spring ensures reliable
closing. Only minimal opening forces have to
be applied here, which results in high dynam-
ics (switching speed) and keeps the coil size
and inductance low.

Additional requirements in relation to the
accuracy of the characteristics place stricter
demands on precision during the manufac-
ture of the valve components and during
their installation than is the case in a pure
on/off switching valve.

In all, PWM valves exhibit the following
 features:
(cid:3) low costs,
(cid:3) non-susceptible to dirt and  contamination,
(cid:3) free from hysteresis,
(cid:3) low leakage, and
(cid:3) simple actuation electronics.

However, drawbacks are 
(cid:3) pressure pulsation and
(cid:3) dependence of the characteristic on the

feed pressure.

Areas of application for the PWM valves with
rising characteristic or high flow rate de-
scribed in the following are:
(cid:3) control of the torque converter lockup

clutch,

(cid:3) clutch control, and
(cid:3) main-pressure control.

3/2 PWM Valve with Rising Characteristic
The pressure-compensated tubular design of
the closing element of this PWM valve (Fig-
ure 6) results in low inertial forces. Even this
circumstance meets the demand for fast
switching times, low noise emission, and long
service life. The pronounced linearity of the
characteristic (Figure 7) in a broad character-
istic and temperature range is an important
advantage for use in the vehicle.

The ends of the characteristic demonstrate
slight discontinuity. This is caused by the
transition from the switching to the holding
operating state (when closed or open). This
inaccuracy is tolerable in these closely  limited
areas.

3/2 PWM Valve with High Flow Rate
The PWM valve with high flow rate has
 essentially the same design as the standard
PWM valve described above, but provides
larger opening cross-sections with a greater di-
ameter and a longer opening stroke of the
closing element (comparison in Table 1). This
design calls for a larger copper winding with a
higher magnetic force (Figures 8 and 9).

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Actuator Types

Pressure Regulator
Two principles are used in the analog valves
for pressure control (Figure 10):

(cid:3) The spool-type pressure regulator opens
a metering notch at the feed port and
 simultaneously closes a metering notch
to the tank return line (two-notch regula-
tor). The position of the regulator plunger
is derived from the equilibrium of forces,
depending on the stamped magnetic force,
the regulated pressure, and the spring
force.

(cid:3) The flat-seat pressure regulator operates as
an adjustable pressure relief valve  (single-
notch regulator). 

With both principles, the regulated pressure
intervenes directly in the equilibrium of
forces, which is why complete closed control
loops are provided. The following text
 explains the flat seat and spool principles
by way of examples.

Spool-Type Pressure Regulator PR-S
The spool-type pressure regulator (Figures 11
to 13) operates as a two-notch regulator. The
regulated pressure is tapped between  inlet and
outlet metering notches, and is produced as a
function of their opening  ratio. Maximum
pressure is obtained with the inlet opened and
the outlet closed, while zero pressure is ob-
tained under reversed conditions. In between
these settings, this pressure regulator changes
its plunger position in the equilibrium be-
tween force of pressure, spring force, and
magnetic force in proportion to the current
passing through the coil and adjusts the con-
trol pressure  accordingly.

The recirculation of the regulated  pressure
to the end face of the plunger via an oilway in
the transmission control plate closes the
closed control loop (external  recirculation).
The regulated pressure can also be included by
means of a stepped plunger or other measures
as a resulting force in the equilibrium of forces
and thus in the closed control loop (internal
recirculation).

The advantages of the spool-type pressure

(cid:3) low temperature sensitivity,

(cid:3) low leakage, and

The disadvantages of the spool-type  pressure
regulator are:
(cid:3) expensive production of the precision com-

ponents, and

(cid:3) precision electronics required.

By combining a frictionless mounting
 (diaphragm spring) with a Teflon-coated
plain bearing, this pressure regulator ensures
minimum hysteresis and optimum accuracy.
The presence of a spool makes the regulator
largely resistant to the influences of system
leakage, fluctuations in feed pressure, or tem-
perature changes.

The spool-type pressure regulator shown in

Figures 11 and 12, with its typical technical
data listed in Table 2, exhibits none of the
drawbacks of the flat-seat pressure regulator
discussed below, but is more expensive than
the latter due to its higher-quality  individual
parts (expensive flange,  precision-machined
plunger).

As with the flat-seat pressure regulator,
there are versions available with rising and
falling characteristics (Figure 13).

Flat-Seat Pressure Regulator PR-F
Like its spool-type counterpart, the flat-seat
pressure regulator is also a proportional valve.
The magnetic force is proportional to the
current passing through the coil. The
 hydraulic pressure acts via the sensing  surface
on the equilibrium of forces. The pressure
regulator can also be fitted with a compres-
sion spring to be able to achieve a defined ini-
tial state. The regulated pressure is established
by a pressure drop caused by oil flowing back
to the tank through a  varying cross-section.

The flat-seat-type pressure regulator is there-
fore essentially an adjustable pressure limiter
with a hydraulic control function. 

The essential features of the flat-seat

 pressure regulator are:
(cid:3) high accuracy,
(cid:3) inexpensive,
(cid:3) non-susceptible to influencing quantities,

310

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Actuator Types

(cid:3) non-susceptible to dirt and  contamination,
(cid:3) high leakage, 
(cid:3) residual pressure present 

(dependent on temperature), and

(cid:3) expensive electronics.

Flat-seat pressure regulator, 
falling characteristic
Figures 14 to 16 show the example of a D30
flat-seat pressure regulator with falling
 characteristic. 

The pressure regulator operates in conjunc-
tion with a restrictor (diameter 0.8... 1.0 mm)
which is either arranged externally in the hy-
draulic-control system or integrated directly
in the pressure regulator. The advantage of the
latter type of restrictor lies in the fact that the
pressure-regulator characteristic (of the vari-
able restrictor at the flat seat) can be more

precisely matched with the  upstream perma-
nent restrictor. Suitable measures can be used
even to compensate temperature sensitivity to
a certain extent.

This pressure regulator described by way of
example has been specially optimized such
that the pressure/current characteristic ex-
hibits low hysteresis and a narrow tolerance
range. These properties are achieved by using
high-quality magnetic-circuit materials and
modern manufacturing procedures.

Since the ratio of the hydraulic resistance
of both restrictors cannot be indiscriminately
small, the pressure/current characteristic of a
typical flat-seat pressure regulator exhibits a
residual pressure which increases as the tem-
perature decreases. The hydraulic-control sys-
tem of the transmission must take this cir-

cumstance into account; accordingly, the ef-
fective range for control does not begin at 0
kPa, but rather at a suitably higher pressure.
Another drawback of the flat-seat pres-
sure regulator manifests itself particularly
when several of these pressure regulators are
used in a transmission: The system dictates
that there is a permanent return oil flow
through the opened pressure regulator to
the oil pan, which results in energy losses
and under certain circumstances may re-
quire the use of a transmission-oil pump
with increased volumetric flow. These draw-
backs can be avoided by increasing the level
of sophistication in the actuator or in the
hydraulic-control system. However, this
 cancels out to some extent the main benefits
of the flat-seat pressure regulator (simple
design and low costs). The options offered
by the closed-end function are discussed in
the following.

Flat-seat pressure regulator, rising
 characteristic (miniature version)
Thanks to the use of high-precision plastic
technology, the D20 flat-seat pressure regu-
lator (Figures 17 to 19) has undergone a
 significant reduction in both size and cost.

With a diameter of little more than

20 mm, it achieves a high level of character-
istic precision while taking up the minimal
amount of space.

Electrohydraulic Actuators

Actuator Types

Deciding on the Pressure-Regulator Type
The decision as to whether a flat-seat pressure
regulator, a spool-type pressure regulator, or
even a PWM valve is used in the transmission
depends on a whole range of considerations.
Some technical criteria have already been dis-
cussed in the descriptions of the individual
types.

These criteria are again set out and com-
pared in Table 4. The figures in this table rep-
resenting accuracy are not absolute, but only
relative to each other. They are only
 approximate values and the conditions may
differ completely according to the vehicle
type used, for example depending on
 constructive details such as
(cid:3) variability of the equilibrium of forces,
(cid:3) variability of the magnetic force,
(cid:3) use of special tools in the magnetic  circuit,
(cid:3) gap between feed pressure and maximum

control pressure,

and system-conditioned criteria such as
(cid:3) type of control,
(cid:3) damping properties of the follow-up

 system,

(cid:3) installation position (horizontal, vertical),
(cid:3) installation location (above or below oil

level or varying),

(cid:3) adjustability of the closed control loop

(end of line programming), and

(cid:3) dirt concentration and dirt composition.

However, selection criteria such as the
 following are not to be underestimated:
(cid:3) The user’s own experience with a  particular

type (familiarity level, risk).

(cid:3) In-house user traditions which can also

lead to a wealth of single-sided  experiences.
(cid:3) Existing control-system concepts, for which
the reworking expense in changing the reg-
ulator type is deemed to be too great.
(cid:3) A cost analysis is conducted partly from a
standpoint of reducing outsourcing costs.
An analysis of the overall costs  including,
for example, the expenditure in internal
production on control-plate machining is
difficult for the user  (existing equipment
. . .).

Simulations in Development

Requirements
The development times (time to market) for
new transmission generations are getting ever
shorter. Testing-compatible actuators must be
available with function data specific to the
transmissions virtually immediately after the
start of any project. The strict demands on
quality and reliability necessitate comprehen-
sive tests and trials with prototypes. The pre-
viously standard iterative method using re-
cursions and modifications will in future not
be practicable from time and cost stand-
points.

In future, function prognoses and analyses of

conspicuous features in the product-creation
process using virtual prototypes will increas-
ingly take place at an earlier stage and will at
least support experimental development.

Computer-aided design of magnetic and
 hydraulic circuits thus forms the basis for
simulation of the static and dynamic proper-
ties of the actuators in the transmission sys-
tem. This simulation can be used to  optimize
functions and analyze properties under limit
conditions. 

Function Simulation
1D simulation enables, for example, the prop-
erties of pressure-control valves to be simu-
lated in their system environment. These in-
clude pressure/current characteristics, tem-
perature sensitivity, dynamics, etc., under
different boundary conditions or  geometric
variables.

Function simulation of the actuator in the
(sub)system is performed for example for the
variables:
(cid:3) characteristic,
(cid:3) dynamics,
(cid:3) temperature influence,
(cid:3) influence of feed-pressure fluctuations, and 
(cid:3) worst-case studies, manufacturing

 tolerances.

Flow Simulation
The Fire tool used by Bosch to calculate
 hydraulic losses and flow forces enables,
for example, the geometries of the hydraulic
section of a pressure-control valve to be opti-
mized is such a way that flow influences on
the pressure/current characteristic are mini-
mized under all operating conditions and
flow cross-sections are optimized.

By way of example, Figure 1 shows the simu-
lated flow characteristic and the pressure dis-
tribution in a flat-seat pressure regulator.

Basic Principles of 1D Simulation
Motion Equation with Force Balance 
The motion equation with force balance is as
follows:

Ftot = ∑(FM + Fp + FFl + FFr + FD + FS) = 0

Magnetic-Circuit Calculation
A finite-element program (such as
MAXWELL 2D or Edison) is used to design
the magnetic circuit and thus the pressure/
current characteristic of a pressure-control
valve. But it can also be used to utilize to
 optimum effect the available space (size
 reduction) and the material of a magnetic cir-
cuit (magnetic-force increase, Figure 2) or to
adapt the force/travel characteristic to the re-
quirement.

The magnetic force is simulated, 
for example, for:
(cid:3) dimensioning,
(cid:3) the layout for the magnetic-force

 characteristic,

(cid:3) eddy-current losses, and
(cid:3) manufacturing tolerances.

The following improvements have been
 implemented as the result of the simulation
(example in Figure 2):
(cid:3) position and shape of the working air gap,
(cid:3) optimized cross-section for a stronger

magnetic flux, and

(cid:3) reconfiguration of the working air gap and
parasitic air gap (geometry, position).

Electronic Transmission Control

Drivetrain Management

Electronic Transmission Control

drivetrain-management system calculates the
conversion into torque and engine speed and
implements them. In order for such a strategy
to be implemented, it is essential for the sys-
tem to be equipped with an electrically actu-
ated throttle valve (drive by wire).

Figure 1 shows the organizational structure of
drivetrain management as part of the overall
vehicle structure. The vehicle coordinator for-
wards the requested propulsion movement to
the drivetrain coordinator while taking into
account the power requirements of other ve-
hicle subsystems (e.g., body or electrical-sys-
tem electronics). The drivetrain coordinator
distributes the power demand to the engine,
converter, and transmission. In the process,
the various coordinators may also have to
solve conflicts of interest that arise in accor-
dance with defined priority criteria. A whole
range of different external influencing factors
(such as environment, traffic situation, vehi-
cle operating status, and driver type) plays a
role here. 

The Cartronic concept is based on an  object-
oriented software structure with physical in-
terfaces, e.g., torque as an interface parameter
of drivetrain management.

In complicated traffic situations, unfamiliar
surroundings, or poor weather conditions
(e.g., heavy rain, snow, or fog), manual
gear changing can distract car drivers to such
an extent as to create situations that are diffi-
cult to control. This also applies to the annoy-
ing, incessant process of engaging and disen-
gaging the clutch when driving in  
stop-and-go traffic. Automatic transmissions
with electronic control assist drivers in these
and other traffic situations so that they can
concentrate fully on the road conditions and
what is happening around them.

Drivetrain Management

As the number of electronic systems in the
vehicle increases, so too does the complexity
of the overall network of the various ECUs.
Controlling such networked structures  re -
quires hierarchical order concepts, such as,
for example, the “Cartronic” system from
Bosch. Coordinated drivetrain manage -
ment is integrated as a substructure in the
“Cartronic” system. It facilitates optimally
matched management of the engine and
transmission in the various vehicle operating
conditions.

The engine is operated as often as possible
in the fuel-saving ranges of its program map.
If the driver adopts a sporty driving style,
however, the high, less economical speed
ranges are increasingly utilized. Such a situa-
tion-dependent mode of
operation presupposes on
the one hand that the dri-
ver command is recog-
nized and on the other
hand that its implementa-
tion is left to the elec-
tronic drivetrain-manage-
ment system and a
higher-level driving strat-
egy. When the driver
presses the accelerator
pedal, the system inter-
prets this action as an
 acceleration request.

Market Trends

The statutory requirements relating to fuel
consumption and exhaust-gas emissions will
play a significant role in transmission devel-
opment over the next few years. There follows
a brief comparison of the requirements of the
main markets for this purpose.

ACEA, JAMA and KAMA
The ACEA (Association des Constructeurs
Européens d’Automobiles, i.e. Association of
European Automobile Manufacturers) has
agreed to reduce the corporate average in
CO2 emissions in the period from 2002 to
2008 from 170 mg CO2 to 140 mg CO2
 (Figure 1).

The Japanese and Korean manufacturers’ as-
sociations (JAMA and KAMA) have adopted
the same limits for the year 2009. In order for
this target to be achieved, the next few years
will see an increased acceptance of transmis-
sion types such as the 6-speed transmission
CVT (continuously variable transmission)
and AST (automated shift transmission).

CAFE Requirements
In contrast to Europe, the USA, the most im-
portant market for automatic transmissions,
has seen no change in the CAFE fuel-con-
sumption requirements (corporate average
fuel efficiency) since 1990 (Figure 2). All at-
tempts to bring about a tightening of these
requirements have proven unsuccessful.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automated Shift Transmission AST

Control of Automated Shift
Transmission AST

Requirements
Current market developments reveal a marked
trend towards an increase in in-car safety and
operating comfort and convenience. This is
accompanied by an increase in vehicle mass
and in the final analysis an  increase in fuel
consumption. The emission guidelines laid
down by legislators (140 g/km CO2 by 2008)
only intensify the situation. 

The automated shift transmission (AST)
combines the advantages of a manually
shifted transmission with the functions of 
an automatic transmission. The automated
version of the classic manual transmission
is characterized by its high efficiency. Slip
losses do not occur as in conventional torque-
converter transmissions. 

Specific fuel consumption in the automatic

mode is below the low level of the manual
transmission.

AST development is founded on the

knowledge and findings gained in connection
with electric-motor clutch management
(ECM). 

Electric-Motor Clutch Management
(ECM)
Application
Following initial experiences with hydraulic
clutch management, users are now concen-
trating their efforts on the use of electric mo-
tors as clutch actuators in the small-car seg-
ment. This new approach allows for savings
to be made on costs and weight, as well as
providing a higher degree of integration. 
Corresponding ECM systems are used in the
Mercedes A-Class, the Fiat Seicento, and the
Hyundai Atoz. 

the clutch-release system. Instead the clutch-
travel sensor is integrated in the electric-mo-
tor actuator. 

The small electric motor offers a low power
density in comparison with a  hydraulic pump
and accumulator. The  electric-motor actuator
is therefore only suitable if it can achieve suf-
ficiently short declutching times for rapid
gearshifts.

Shifting without Torque Correction
In the conventional system without torque
correction (Figure 1), the clutch torque is far
in excess of the engine torque. The reason be-
hind this is that the dry clutch, which has to
transfer at least the engine torque under all
extreme conditions, normally offers a  reserve
of 50 to 150%. The engine torque drops when
the driver wishes to change gear and at the
same time takes his foot off the accelerator
pedal. Operating the shift lever initiates the
intention to change gear, and the clutch must
now be moved from the fully closed to the
fully open position. This defines the declutch-
ing time. 

If the declutching time is too long, the clutch
will still transfer torque while the next gear is
being synchronized, a process which may re-
sult in rattling or damage to the transmission.

Design and Operating Concept
The most important step in minimizing costs
was switching from a hydraulic actuator to an
electric-motor actuator. This step removed
the need for a pump, an accumulator, and
valves as well as the need for a travel sensor in

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automated Shift Transmission AST

319

Design and Operating Concept
The electric-motor AST features the auto-
mated clutch operation of the ECM system.
With an additional electric-motor actuator
for the transmission, the driver is able to
change gear without there being a mechanical
connection between the selector lever and the
transmission (shift by wire). 

In the case of the AST, all modifications to the
transmission are to be avoided. This will en-
able the transmission manufacturer to mount
either manual transmissions or ASTs on the
production line. As the hardware for this
 system (e.g., for the Opel Corsa Easytronic),
Bosch supplies the electric  motors for clutch
engagement, shifting, and selection (see chap-
ter entitled “Trans mission, Automated Shift
Transmission”), and the ECU. Automated and
cost-effective mass production is made possi-
ble by the use of standard components in all
AST applications.

Shifting with Torque Correction
The most technically sophisticated solution
for avoiding transmission damage is to
 combine a reduced-force clutch with torque
correction.

Figure 2 shows the shifting operation with
torque correction, in which the clutch torque
is only marginally above the engine torque.
When the driver takes his foot off the acceler-
ator pedal to change gear, the clutch torque
drops as well as the engine torque. When the
intention to change gear is initiated, the
clutch is thus already almost open and the re-
maining declutching operation follows very
rapidly.

Figure 3 features a schematic representa-
tion of electric-motor clutch management
(ECM) as a partial-automation solution, and
the automated shift transmission (AST) as
the complete automation of the manual
transmission, both as add-on systems. 

Electric-Motor Automated Shift
 Transmission AST
Application
Today the AST is used primarily in the lower
torque classes (e.g., VW Lupo, MCC Smart,
Opel Corsa Easytronic, see also chapter enti-
tled “Transmission Types”), where, in com-
parison to the fully automatic transmission,
the cost benefit makes up for the downside of
the interruption in tractive force.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automated Shift Transmission AST

Software Sharing
The vehicle manufacturer (OEM), the sup-
plier and if necessary a system integrator
share the AST software tasks. The operating
system, signal conditioning, and the hard-
ware-specific routines for activating the
 actuators are provided by Bosch. Bosch’s
 extensive knowledge and experience in the
field of automatic transmissions is also
 applied in establishing the AST target gears.
This includes, among others, driver recogni-
tion, uphill/downhill recognition, cornering
recognition, and other adaptive functions
(see also chapter entitled “Adaptive Transmis-
sion Control, ATC”).

The tasks of activating the transmission and
coordinating the gearshift sequence (clutch,
engine, transmission) are the responsibility of
the OEM or the system integrator. 

This also applies to clutch control, significant
parts of which can be taken over from the
ECM system. Each vehicle manufacturer
brings its marque-specific philosophy
 regarding shifting time, shifting points,
and shifting sequences to bear.

4

Phases of AST shifting operation

Shifting Operation and Interruption of 
Tractive Force
The basic problem associated with the AST 
is the interruption of tractive force. This is
represented in Figure 4 by the “hollow” of the
vehicle acceleration between the two shifted
gears. In terms of what is required of the 
actuators, these phases can be divided into
two blocks:
(cid:3) phases which have an effect on the vehicle

(cid:3) phases which represent pure response

acceleration,

times.

In the phases which have an effect on the
 vehicle acceleration, it transpires that a throt-
tle action is needed because excessively quick
changes in vehicle acceleration are felt to be
unpleasant. The optimum interaction of en-
gine, clutch, and transmission intervention
results in the best possible performance.

The synchromesh can be supported for
 example by double-declutching. In the
 response times, however, the maximum speed
of the actuators is demanded. It is  important
here that the synchromesh does not experience
too hard a shock after the gear has been disen-
gaged and the following rapid phase.

Figure 5 shows a comparison of the shifting
times that can be achieved with a hydraulic
system and an electric-motor system and the
shifting time necessary for a comfortable
shifting operation. The bar lengths equate to
the times required for the individual phases
and the same shading schemes are used.

When the capacity of the actuators is
 exploited to maximum effect, the electric-
motor system only demonstrates a time
 disadvantage compared with its hydraulic
counterpart in the clutch-operation phase.
This could be reduced in particular in the
torque-reduction phase by an intelligent con-

trol strategy such as torque correction or by
the interaction of the engine and the clutch. 

It is important to highlight here that there
is hardly any difference between the two
 systems in the phases for response time, gear
disengagement, and gear engagement. The 
response times are not extended practically,
even in the case of comfortable shifting.
However, the phases relevant to acceleration
must be two to four times as long as in the
extreme case, both for the hydraulic and the
electric-motor actuator systems.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automatic Transmissions

Hydraulic Control
The main function of the hydraulic-control
system (Figures 1 and 2) is to regulate, boost,
and distribute hydraulic pressures and volu-
metric flows. This includes generating the
clutch pressures, supplying the converter, and
providing the lubricating pressure. The hous-
ings of the hydraulic-control system are made
from diecast aluminum and contain several
precision-machined slide valves and electro-
hydraulic actuators.

Main control with hydraulic valves

Control of Automatic

Requirements
The control system for an automatic trans-
mission must fulfill the following essential 
requirements or functions:
(cid:3) always shifting the correct gear or setting
the correct gear ratio as a function of
 assorted influencing variables, 

(cid:3) executing the shifting operation through
adapted pressure characteristics as com-
fortably as possible,

(cid:3) implementing additional manual interven-

tions on the part of the driver,

(cid:3) detecting maloperations, e.g. by preventing

non-permitted gearshifts,

(cid:3) providing ATF oil for cooling, lubrication

and for the converter.

Current control systems are exclusively
 electrohydraulic in nature.

323

Electrohydraulic Control
Due to their extensive range of functions, all
modern automatic transmissions with four to
six gears and continuously variable transmis-
sions are exclusively controlled by electrohy-
draulic means. In contrast to earlier, purely
hydraulic control systems with  mechanical
regulators, the clutches are  activated individ-
ually by pressure regulators, which facilitate
precise modulation and  regulated overlap-
ping gearshifts (without a one-way clutch).

Clutch Control
Clutch control is always performed with
 either pilot-controlled or directly controlled
pressure.

Pilot Control
With pilot control, the required pressure
and throughflow for rapid clutch filling are
provided via a slide valve in the control hous-
ing. Pressure regulation is effected by pilot
pressure acting on the sensing surface of the
slide valve. An actuator generates this pilot
pressure (Figure 3). 

This results in greater degrees of freedom
in the packaging and the use of standardized
actuators, high dynamics, and small electro-
magnets.

Direct Control
With direct control, the required pressure and
throughflow for rapid clutch filling are pro-
vided directly by the actuator (Figure 4). 

This results in a compact clutch-control sys-

tem with reduced hydraulic sophistication.

Shifting-Sequence Control
Conventional Shifting-Sequence control
The following two shifting scenarios are
 examples of conventional control of a simple
4-speed automatic transmission with one-
way clutches (Figure 5).

Upshift Under Load
Unlike in a manual transmission, throttling
upshifts in an automatic transmission take
place without an interruption of tractive
force. The graphic in Figure 6 shows the time
curve of the characteristic variables during an
upshift into the direct gear (ratio 1). Shifting
begins at time t0: The clutch is filled with
fluid and the friction  elements are pressed
against each other. The clutch transfers a
torque from time t1 onwards. As the clutch
torque increases, so the torque supported at
the one-way clutch decreases. The one-way
clutch is released at time t2. Now the engine
speed begins to change. The clutch torque in-
creases to t3. The clutch slips up to t4, after

which it sticks. After the end of the shifting
operation, the clutch pressure is controlled
upward to a level of safety. 

The speed difference between the engine
and the transmission output speed remain-
ing after t4 is caused by the converter, which
always operates with slip when locked up.

The progression of the output torque in the
phase t1...t4 determines the gear-shift so-
phistication (ease of shifting). To ensure
good shift quality, the clutch pressure must
be set so that the output torque is between
the level at t < t1 and the level at t > t4. The
torque jump at t4 should also be as low as
possible. 

The load on the friction elements is de-
termined by the clutch torque and the slip
time (t4 – t1). It is clear here that controlling
the shifting sequence always involves a com-
promise.

Downshift Under Load
In contrast to upshifts, downshifts take place
with an interruption of tractive force.
Figure 7 shows the time progression.

At t0 shifting begins with the clutch being

drained. Engine torque is no longer trans-
ferred from t1 onwards and the engine revs
up. At t2 the synchronization speed of the
new gear is reached and the one-way clutch
is engaged; up to t3 the converter slip is set
according to the engine torque. The shifting
operation is completed at t3. The gear-shift
sophistication (ease of shifting) is deter-
mined by the torque drop in the phase t0...t1
and depends quite significantly on the
torque increase between t2 and t2.

All the shifting scenarios that occur are
primarily controlled by the electronic sys-
tem; the hydraulic system is left above all
with the function of clutch power control. 
In all newer transmissions (5-speed
and 6-speed types), one-way clutches are
 replaced by regular clutches for weight
 reasons. However, during the shifting
 operations, they require overlap control

Overlap control US

for the clutches (Figure 8). This means that
while clutch 1 opens for gear x, clutch 2 must
close for gear y. Since this type of  control is
very elaborate and time-critical, it is necessary
to provide considerably higher computing
power in the ECU than for the simple shifting
sequences with one-way clutch shifts (see also
chapter entitled “ECUs”).

The most important features of overlap
 control are:
(cid:3) low mechanical complexity,
(cid:3) minimal space requirement,
(cid:3) multiple use for different gear steps

(cid:3) high control precision for load transfer

Fill time

Adaptive Pressure Control
The function of adaptive pressure control is
to achieve a consistently good shift quality
over the entire working life of the transmis-
sion and the accompanying changes in the
friction coefficients at the clutch surfaces.
It also compensates for any potential devia-
tion of the calculated torque or the torque
transferred by the engine which can occur 
on account of changes to the engine or
 manufacturing tolerances.

In this case, an important role is played by
pressure adaptation with the aid of the shift-
ing times applied by the manufacturer. To this
end, the applied shifting times are compared
with the real shifting times that occur. If the
measurements are repeatedly outside a pre-
specified tolerance range, the pressure para-
meters pertaining to the shifting operation
are incrementally adapted. A distinction is
made here between the fill time and the slip
time of the clutch.

Fill-Time Measurement
The fill time tfill (Figure 9) is the time from
the start of the gearshift tshift to the start of
synchronization (a drop in speed is identified
during the upshift [US]):

tfill = tvertex – tshift

Slip-Time Measurement
The slip time tslip (Figure 10) of the clutch is
the time from recognition of the speed vertex
(start of synchronization) to complete syn-
chronization of the speed in the new gear.

The speed thresholds used for measuring the

following relationship applies to upshifts:
Start of fill-time measurement = start of
shifting

Vertex: A decrease in the turbine speed ntu by
at least ntu (vertex) revolutions is detected.

ntu (t – 1) – ntu (t) > ntu (diff)

Synchronization speed: An increase in the tur-
bine speed ntu by at least ntu (sync) revolu-
tions is detected.

ntu (t) – ntu (t – 1) > Δntu (sync)

Pressure Correction
Pressure adaptation is only permitted within
specific limits on account of operational reli-
ability. The typical adaptation width lies in
the range of ±10% of the modulation pres-
sure calculated for the shift. The correction
values are also still distinguished according 
to speed bands.

The adaptation values are stored in a 
non-volatile memory so that the optimum
modulation pressure can be reapplied when
the vehicle is restarted. The overall pattern 
of pressure adaptation can also be evaluated
as a sign of changes in the transmission. 

Shifting-Point Selection
Conventional Shifting-Point Selection
In the majority of automatic transmissions
currently available, the driving program is 
selected using a selector switch or a button.
The following driving programs are generally
available in this respect:
(cid:3) Economy (very economical),
(cid:3) Sport, or
(cid:3) Winter.

The individual programs differ in the posi-
tion of the shifting points in relation to the
position of the accelerator pedal and the dri-
ving speed. The Economy and Sport shifting
maps of a 5-speed transmission are used here
as examples (Figure 11).

If the current driving speed or the accelera-
tor-pedal position corresponding to the
 driver command (accelerator-pedal value) in-
tersects the shift curve, a gearshift is triggered.
 A requested gearshift can be either canceled
or converted into a double shift within a spe-
cific period of time (which  depends on the
hydraulic system of the  automatic transmis-
sion)

For example, the driver is driving in fifth
gear on an interstate highway and would like
to overtake. To do so, he presses the accelera-
tor pedal to the floor, whereupon a downshift
is requested.

Uphill Driving
Recognition of uphill driving by comparing
the current acceleration with the requested
acceleration by way of the engine torque,
 results in upshifts and downshifts at higher
engine speeds and thus prevents gearshift
hunting.

Cornering
This facility uses the difference in wheel
speeds to calculate whether the vehicle is in a
curve or bend. With active cornering recogni-
tion, requested shifts are delayed or prohibited
in order to increase vehicle stability.

Winter Recognition
Winter operation is recognized on the basis of
slip detection from analysis of the wheel
speeds. This serves primarily to
(cid:3) prevent the wheels from spinning and
(cid:3) select a higher gear during starting so that

less torque is transferred to the drive
wheels, thereby preventing premature
wheel spin.

ASC Operation
If the system detects while driving that the
ASC ECU (anti-slipping control or traction
control system, TCS) is in control mode,
 requested gearshifts are suppressed in order
to support the ASC function. 

When the accelerator pedal is firmly pressed
to the floor, the 4-3 DS shift curve is inter-
sected directly after the 5-4 DS shift curve,
and a 5-3 double downshift is performed
 instead of a sequential downshift. Special
shifting points for kickdown (forced down-
shift) allow the maximum possible engine
power to be utilized at this point.

Adaptive Transmission Control (ATC)
All newer transmission-control systems have –
instead of active driving-program selection by
the driver – software which enables the driver
to adapt to the special ambient conditions
while driving. This includes first and foremost
driver-type recognition and driving- situation
recognition. Examples which are currently in
use are adaptive transmission control (ATC)
from BMW and the dynamic shift program
(DSP) from Audi.

Driver-Type Recognition
A driver type can be identified by means of
an evaluation of the actions he or she
 performs. This includes:
(cid:3) kickdown operation,
(cid:3) brake operation, and
(cid:3) restriction via selector lever.

For example, the kickdown evaluator counts
the number of times the driver engages kick-
down during a presettable period of time. If
the counter exceeds a specific threshold, the
driver-type recognition facility selects the next,
more sporty driving program. It automatically
switches back to a more economical driving
program once this time has elapsed.

Driving-Situation Recognition
For driving-situation recognition, different
transmission-control input variables are
linked to conclusions about the present
 driving condition. The following situations
can generally be recognized:
(cid:3) uphill driving,
(cid:3) cornering,
(cid:3) winter operation, and
(cid:3) ASC operation.

A precisely controlled time characteristic of

power. The engine management  system im-
plements the torque command (reduction) 
of the transmission control by retarding the
moment of ignition.

The theoretical principles, processes, and
measurement results are presented using the

Requirements
The ever-increasing demand for more eco-
nomical fuel consumption in motor vehicles
dictates to a significant degree the develop-
ment objectives in the field of automatic
transmissions as well. In addition to measures
for improving the efficiency of the transmis-
sion itself (such as, for instance, the torque
converter lockup clutch), these objectives
 include introducing transmissions with more
gears. However, additional gear steps in-
evitably call for increased shift frequency.
This in turn results in increased demands
placed on gear-shift sophistication (conve-
nience) and the load capacity of the friction
elements.

Engine intervention takes into account
both requirements and institutes an addi-
tional degree of freedom for controlling an
automatic transmission. “Engine interven-
tion” covers all those measures which allow
the engine torque generated by the combus-
tion process during the shifting operation 
in the transmission to be specifically influ-
enced and in particular reduced. Engine
 intervention can be used in both upshifts and
downshifts.

The primary aim of engine intervention
in upshifts is to reduce the lost energy that oc-
curs in the friction elements during the shift-
ing operation. This is done by reducing the
engine torque during synchronization without
interrupting the tractive force. The margin 
acquired in this process can be used to:
(cid:3) Increase the service life by shortening the
slip time (if all other operating parameters
in the transmission, such as clutch pressure
and number of plates, remain unchanged).
(cid:3) Improve the convenience by reducing the
clutch torque, brought about by lowering
the clutch pressure during the slip phase.

(cid:3) Transmit higher power, provided the

 mechanical strength of the transmission
permits this; in most cases, however, the
power loss in the clutches is the limiting
factor.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automatic Transmissions

329

Naturally, it is also possible to adopt a sensible
combination of these measures within the
framework of the specified margin.

Δω = ω1 – ω2

The aim of engine intervention in downshifts
is to reduce the jolt which occurs when the
one-way clutch or a friction element  engages
at the end of the synchronization processes.
This results in
(cid:3) improved convenience and
(cid:3) supported and improved synchronization

in transmissions without one-way clutches.

Interventions in the Mechanical Shifting
 Sequence
The following explanations illustrate which
possibilities present themselves for interven-
tion in the mechanical shifting sequence. The
individual phases of upshifts and downshifts
are described in the section entitled “Shifting-
Sequence Control”.

Upshifts
Engine intervention is discussed using the ex-
ample of an upshift from the direct gear (i =
1) to overdrive (i < 1). The following simplifi-
cations serve to illustrate the physical rela-
tionships more clearly:
(cid:3) The influence of the torque converter is

disregarded.

(cid:3) There is no overlap of friction elements,
i.e., only one friction element participates
in the gearshift.

(cid:3) The engine torque remains constant during

the gearshift, thereby providing linear
speed characteristics.

(cid:3) The vehicle speed during the gearshift is

taken to be constant.

(cid:3) The heating of the friction linings by

Upshifts take place without an interruption of
the tractive force. Synchronization of engine
and transmission takes place via a friction
 element in slipping-intervention operation.
The following relative speed ensues between
the drive and output side of the clutch:

In relation to the lost energy which must
be absorbed or forwarded by the friction
 elements during the shifting operation, the
following equation applies:

Q = (cid:4) MC (t) · Δω(t) · dt

Furthermore, the angular-momentum princi-
ple applies to the drive and output sides of
the clutch. For the rotational masses of the
drive side:

i.e., the lost energy is dependent only on the

When the clutch torque determined by (4) is
applied in (5), this produces the lost  en ergy as

briefly successive shifting operations is dis-
regarded.

This produces the lost energy to be absorbed

Both these shares are roughly of the same or-
der of magnitude. At speeds of n = 3000 rpm
and typical values for the gear step and the
engine-drag torque (i = 0.8, 
JE = 0.3 kg · m2, ME = 100 Nm, tS = 500 ms),
this produces: 

Qcom/Qkin ≈ 1...4

This clearly shows the possibilities of engine
intervention for reducing the power loss in
the friction elements.

A further significant aspect is derived from
(6): Only the share of lost energy stemming
from the combustion energy is dependent on
the slip time tS. The decisive factor is the
product of the engine torque and the slip
time. This means, however, that the slip time
can be extended accordingly when the engine
torque is reduced without an increase in the
total lost energy. In actual fact, the wear of the
friction elements even decreases with con-
stant total lost energy when the slip time is
extended. The temperature of the friction lin-
ings corresponds to the load on the friction
elements.

Figure 12a shows the lost energy absorbed

by the friction element as a function of the
engine torque and the slip time. The maxi-
mum permitted lost energy Qlimit and the
 engine torque to be transferred during this
gearshift determine the maximum slip time,
for instance in accordance with point S. The
maximum permitted energy Qlimit corre-
sponds in accordance with (5) to the clutch
torque determined by the slip time MClimit
(point 1 in Figure 12b).

To reduce the lost energy, the clutch torque

in relation to point S would have to be in-
creased and thereby the slip time shortened.
However, this would lead in equal measure to

a reduction in gear-shift sophistication (con-
venience). A reduction of the clutch pressure
is not permitted in this case, as otherwise
Qlimit will be exceeded.

It is now easy to tell from Figure 12 which
possibilities are offered by engine interven-
tion. It is taken that the engine torque to be
transferred ME = 100 Nm can be reduced
during the slip phase to an average of 50%.
When first the case of constant clutch torque
(shift quality) is considered, reducing the en-
gine torque to 50 Nm results in a shortening
of the slip time from 400 ms to 245 ms (point
1 (cid:2) point 2) with a simultaneous  reduction
in lost energy to 61% (point 3). If, on the
other hand, the slip time is kept constant, the

clutch torque can be reduced from 179 Nm to
128.5 Nm (point 1 (cid:2) point 4) with a reduc-
tion in lost energy to 72% (point 5).

The maximum sensible slip time is then ob-
tained if the minimum clutch torque MCmin
during the gearshift does not drop below the
value after the end of the shift. On the one
hand, a smaller engine torque as a result of
engine intervention would result in a deterio-
ration in convenience; on the other hand, the
clutch torque for safety reasons should at any
rate be so large that the non-reduced  engine
torque can be transferred by the  friction ele-
ment after the end of the shift.

In this example, it is taken that the torque

to be transferred at least by the clutch is
100 Nm in accordance with the engine torque
(direct gear). This means that the slip time
can be stretched from 400 ms to max. 625 ms
(point 6), again with a simultaneous reduc-
tion in lost energy to 88% (point 7).

Finally, it can be gleaned from Figure 12 that
even an engine torque of 200 Nm, which
without intervention would require a maxi-
mum slip time of 200 ms with a minimum
clutch torque of 360 Nm (point 8), can be
traced back to the example with a torque of
100 Nm (point 1).

The results of this analysis are on the safe side
in this respect because extending the slip time
with constant lost energy results in reduced
friction-lining temperature and thus protects
the friction linings. Table 1 lists the numerical
values for these examples.

Downshifts
In contrast to upshifts, downshifts take place
in the throttling mode with an interruption
of load. The engine is decoupled from the
drivetrain and runs as a result of the torque it
has generated up to the synchronization
speed. Only after the one-way clutch or the
friction element has engaged is the frictional
connection re-established. The torque ratios

determine the gear-shift sophistication
 (convenience) to a substantial extent.

For a better understanding of the character-
istic relationships, damping in the drivetrain is
disregarded in the following analysis. It also ap-
plies on the assumption that the overall  vehicle
dynamics can be reduced to engine mass, in-
put-shaft rigidity, and vehicle inertia.

In the case of all the moments of inertia relat-
ing to the transmission output, the engine and
the vehicle are governed by the following:

JE · Φ¨

E = ME,  JV · Φ¨

V = –W

(9)

At the point when the one-way clutch
 engages, the drivetrain resembles a torsion
damper (Figure 13, next page), and the
 motion equations are as follows:

JE · Φ¨

E = c (Φ¨

V – Φ¨

E) + ME

JV · Φ¨

V = c · (Φ¨

V – Φ¨

E) –W

(10a)

(10b)

Since in this case it is not the absolute angle
of rotation but rather only the deviations
from the basic rotation (i.e., the rotation of
the input shaft) which are significant, these
two equations can combined. If the driving
speed υ for the short time segments to be
considered is taken as constant, this  produces
with
ΦE = ΦEo + (cid:8)E,  ΦV = ΦVo + (cid:8)F,

in the real vehicle.

Similar conditions are present in a gearshift
from friction element to friction element
(overlapping gearshift), only this involves
the additional problem of cutting in the
 friction element of the new gear exactly
when the synchronization speed is reached.
As the damping effects of the torque con-
verter and the rest of the drivetrain have
been disregarded in this analysis, the possi-
bility which engine intervention offers is all
the more clear:

According to (13), the initial acceleration
acting on the driver at time t0 is directly pro-
portional to the engine torque and thus the
engine acceleration during the run-up
phase. With precisely timed control of the
engine torque in the time segment t ≤ t0 to
t >> t0, it is possible to create an almost
 continuous transition from the range of
tractive-force interruption to the range of
tractive-force transfer. 

Implementation takes the form of a
marked reduction in engine torque at time
t0 followed by renewed control-up in accor-
dance with a time function. The conve-
nience can be varied within broad limits
with this control-up.

There is an equally clear possibility in
gearshifts without a one-way clutch of influ-
encing the engine acceleration by control-

ling the engine torque in the time range
t ≤ t0 and thereby reducing the time de-
mands on the cut-in precision of the friction
element at the synchronization point.

Sequence Control
The process of reducing the engine torque
is essentially very simple. However, effective
control requires precise coordination as the
entire process only lasts approximately
500 ms.

Pure time control of engine intervention is
not practicable because different variables
which determine the sequence (such as
clutch fill times, plate friction coefficients,
and similar) fluctuate within broad limits
depending on the temperature and the
 service life.

As engine intervention is directly linked to
the shifting sequence, a speed sequence
 control system suggests itself. The character-
istic variable that characterizes the shifting
 sequence exactly is the transmission input
 sequence. The engine speed is also suited with
limitations to transmissions with hydrody-
namic converters as the controlled variable.
This is therefore important because it re-
quires a separate sensor to record the trans-
mission input speed, and not every transmis-
sion is fitted with this sensor for cost reasons.
In the interests of clarity, the following text
describes the control system with the trans-
mission input speed as the characteristic
variable and reference is made, where neces-
sary, to the limitations or changes when the
engine speed is used.

Upshifts
The time curve of the characteristic vari-
ables for an upshift is depicted in Figure 14.
The ratio of the old gear is retained up to

the overrunning point t2; only then does
only a slipping clutch intervene. For this
 reason, the engine torque cannot be reduced
before the overrunning point is reached,
otherwise this would entail an intensified
dip in the output torque in the phase t1...t2.

The overrunning point is identified through
continual monitoring of the transmission
input speed in the time phase after t0. For
this purpose, the maximum speed is calcu-
lated in the time phase t0...t3 as well as the
speed gradient.

The overrunning point is identified in the
event of a reduction in the gradient by more
than a pre-specified threshold value, and
 engine-torque control begins with control-
down to a pre-specified value in accordance
with a pre-specified time function.

In order to determine the speed n3 at the
start of control-up, the synchronization speed
n4 = n1/i in the new gear is calculated from
the maximum speed n1 at the overrunning
point and the ratio jump i of the gear change
to be carried out. A speed-dependent share
Δn is added to this synchronization speed
in order to obtain a derivative action for
 control-up. When the speed n3 = n4 + Δn is
reached, torque control-up begins in accor-
dance with a pre-specified time function. The
end of the gearshift is identified as soon as the
value of the non-corrected torque is achieved.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automatic Transmissions

For upshifts in the upper load range (greater
than half load), the engine speed is used as the
controlled variable instead of the transmission
input speed because here the shifting points
are at such great engine speeds that the con-
verter operates in the clutch range and is thus
subject to roughly constant slip.

Gearshifts at part load on the other hand
take place in the converter range. This means
that the slip can change very substantially
during a gearshift. Here the engine speed is
no longer suitable for determining the syn-
chronization speed. In this case, a
 superimposed form of time control, which
 terminates engine intervention after a pre-
specified time, is suitable for the part-load
range t3...t4.

Downshifts
The time curve of the characteristic variables
for a downshift is depicted in Figure 15.
 Precise determination and recording of the
synchronization speed are crucial to  engine
intervention in the case of downshifts  because

(cid:3) retarding the ignition angle too early ex-
tends the engine revving phase and thus
the time of tractive-force interruption and

(cid:3) engine intervention after the one-way

clutch has engaged does not bring about
any improvement in convenience, but
rather a deterioration as this causes a dip in
torque for the duration of the engine inter-
vention.

The synchronization speed is calculated via
the gear step from the transmission input
speed at the start of the gearshift. The engine
torque is abruptly reduced approximately 
200 rpm before the synchronization speed is
reached until this speed is reached or slightly
exceeded. Then the engine torque is slowly
controlled up again.

The synchronization speed cannot be
 calculated directly by means of the engine
speed as a result of the slip at the hydrody-
namic torque converter. A consideration of
the converter program map with the requisite
accuracy requires too much computation 
effort in the microcontroller.

It is possible however to calculate the syn-
chronization speed from the transmission
output speed by multiplying it by the corre-
sponding gear step. It is now possible to iden-
tify by means of the engine speed when the
synchronization point is reached, since the
speed difference between the engine and the
turbine is approximately zero when the en-
gine revs up freely (interruption of tractive
force) to the synchronization point.

The different possibilities of torque reduction
are now discussed in the following text.

Shifting the Ignition Angle
The oldest version of engine intervention
 involves intervention through shifting of the
ignition angle. This form of intervention
 offers the following advantages:
(cid:3) continuous regulation of the engine

torque within broad limits,

(cid:3) short response time, and
(cid:3) availability in all vehicles with gasoline-

Engine-Torque Specification
In appropriately equipped vehicles with
their CAN network of all the ECUs in the
drivetrain (Figure 17), torque reduction is
performed on the basis of a torque interface
between engine management (TI-Motronic)
and electronic transmission control (ETC).
The torque reductions of the ABS and TCS
ECUs must also be taken into consideration.

Figure 18 shows how a current transmis-
sion-control system calculates the desired
engine torque intervention (ETI_Etc).

The next torque intervention is determined

as a function of the available torque (actual
torque). The torque M is the engine torque of
the engine-management system without
 intervention by transmission control.

engines.

Figure 16 shows in schematic form the de-
pendence of the engine torque on the igni-
tion angle for different load conditions and
engine speeds. It is clear from this figure that
adjusting a pre-specified engine torque gen-
erally requires an ignition map as a function
of engine load and engine speed. 

The response time τ between the initiation
of engine intervention and the start of
 reduction in engine torque is specified by
the ignition angle, therefore

τ ≈ ·

1
(z/2) · nE

where z is the number of cylinders and nE
the engine speed. In the effective speed
range n ≥ 2000 rpm, the maximum delay
for a 6-cylinder engine is 10 ms for initiation
and 30 ms for a complete reduction in
 engine torque.

Torque Converter Lockup Clutch
Application and Operating Concept
The hydrodynamic converter is (necessitated
by its operating principle) subject to a level of
slip which is required particularly for conve-
nience reasons during startup and in certain
driving situations to increase torque. Since
this slip also involves a simultaneous loss of
power, the torque converter lockup clutch
(TCLC) was developed with this in mind (see
also section entitled “Torque  Converter”).

It is only advisable to lock up the converter
from a specific speed because at low speeds
the irregular rotation of the engine would
cause uncomfortable vibrations in the
 drivetrain. The controlled torque converter
lock up clutch (CTCC) was developed in  order
to be able to utilize these ranges for lockup
as well.

Electronic Transmission Control

Control of Automatic Transmissions

337

Controlled Torque Converter Lockup Clutch
The controlled torque converter lockup
clutch (CTCC) sets a very low level of slip
(40...50 rpm) and thus an almost stationary
state. In this way, it keeps unwanted vibra-
tions away from the drivetrain. The converter
lockup clutch therefore has three  different
states:
(cid:3) open,
(cid:3) controlled, and
(cid:3) closed.

These states are defined by means of charac-
teristic curves, which are plotted like shift
curves for each gear against throttle-valve
opening and driving speed (Figure 19). As is
the case with shift curves, fuel consumption
and tractive force are crucial criteria for the
torque converter lockup clutch.

In slipping controlled operation, the speed

differential between the converter impeller
and turbine is constantly set to a low value. A
closed control loop constantly compares the
speed differential with a pre-specified set-

The aforementioned transmission equipment

Contact-Pressure Control
The belt contact pressure is adjusted in
 accordance with the current load situation
with the aid of the measured secondary pres-
sure. To achieve a high level of efficiency, the
secondary pressure is reduced to such an ex-
tent that the current engine torque can still be
transferred to a specific degree of safety and
reliability without the belt slipping.

In the event of a control-elec-

limp-home requirements par-
tially determine the hydraulic
concept. Engine overspeeding
and associated high slip at the
driven wheels must be avoided
at all costs. An adjustment in
the overdrive direction would
satisfy this requirement, but
starting from a standing stop
would no longer be possible.

Pump Activation
A variable-capacity pump must be used to
ensure high transmission efficiency. This
pump enables the delivery flow to be limited
at high speeds. 

Suitable suction-throttled pumps which
 operate without additional activation have
been in development for years, but have failed
to make a breakthrough as yet. An initial step
towards a “variable-capacity pump” has been
taken in the form of a two-stage version, in
which the more favorable delivery flow can be
selected as a function of the current demand.

Further concepts are feasible with continu-
ously variable pumps, in which secondary-
pressure control and pump adjustment can
be combined.

Reverse-Gear Lock
Engagement of the reverse gear is disabled
during forward driving at speeds above a
limit to be defined (e.g., 7 km/h). 

Deactivation of Limp-Home Function
Limp-home is an emergency function which
is shut down during normal control opera-
tion. 

The fail-safe function remains permanently
activated so that engine overrevving is
avoided even in the event of a partial failure
or late identification of partial failures.

Ratio Control
The gear ratio can be changed by means
of the primary pulley. The enclosed fluid
 volume determines the axial position of the
moving part of the primary pulley and thus
the radius on which the belt circulates on the
pulley. The primary pressure adjusts  itself in
response to the secondary pressure.

The requirements of driveability determine
the necessary adjustment speed. For example,
in the case of kickdown, it is necessary to
switch from overdrive to low within 1.5 s. On
the other hand, the pump delivery limits the
adjustment speed.

Driving Program
A driving program ascertains the desired gear
ratio. In addition to different program maps
for normal operation, in which there is the
option of choosing between economical and
sporty operation (see also section entitled
“Adaptive Transmission Control, ATC”), it is
also possible to implement  special functions
such as kickdown,  downhill driving, etc. 

It is also possible to simulate range trans-
missions, where any intermediate variations
between copying a manually shifted transmis-
sion and an automatic transmission are real-
izable (see also chapter entitled “Transmis-
sion for Motor Vehicles”).

Clutch Activation
The interrupting clutch between engine and
drivetrain is designed as a function of the po-
sition of the selector lever (P-R-N-D), the en-
gine speed, and the engine load.

Activation of Converter and 
Torque Converter Lockup Clutch
In order to achieve the greatest possible
 efficiency, it is essential for the converter to be
locked up as early as possible. Depending on
the power requirement, the torque  increase is
used up to different speeds for  acceleration.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs)

ECUs for Electronic Transmission Control

ECUs for Electronic

Application
In implementing electronic transmission
control, engineers can choose to locate the
ECUs in different positions in the vehicle.
There are, for example, separate, combined,
mounted, or integrated ECUs (Figure 1). 

The way in which these ECUs are distributed

in the vehicle is essentially determined by
(cid:3) the ratio of vehicles with automatic trans-
missions to vehicles with manually shifted
transmissions and

(cid:3) the demands made by the transmission on
the control system (performance of the mi-
crocontroller used).
In Europe, the market is still dictated by the
separate printed-circuit-board ECUs ME and

1

Possible distribution of ECUs in the drivetrain

TC (Figure 1a). In the USA, on the other
hand, it is predominantly the combined dri-
vetrain ECU (MEG) that is used for 4-speed
and 5-speed automatic transmissions (Figure
1b), the reason for this  being that automatic
transmissions dominate the market in Amer-
ica with a market share of over 85 %.

The newer 6-speed or 7-speed transmission
types and the increasing demands on engine-
management systems (emission-control legis-
lation, CARB requirements) have now started
a trend in the USA moving away from com-
bined ECUs in favor of separate ECUs. This
trend is consolidated still further by the latest
generation of 6-speed trans missions. These
transmissions are already equipped with 
electronic modules with  integrated electronic
circuitry.

Design and Operating Concept
The various ECUs and their technical and
functional details will be discussed below.

Printed Circuit Board ECUs
The most widely used ECUs currently are
printed circuit board (PCB) units. 

Figure 2 shows an ECU with a 32-bit
micro controller (Motorola 683xx) for a 
ZF 5-speed transmission. This transmission
has been in mass production at BMW for
some years now. The figure depicts the
 essential layout and the data flow of the ECU
in a block diagram. The ECU itself can be
roughly divided into three sections:

1. Input side
The input side comprises the power supply
(terminals 15 and 30), signal acquisition, and
the communication interface.

The input signals include the signals for
engine speed, turbine speed, output speed,
and wheel speeds. The transmission control
unit usually receives the engine-speed and
wheel-speed signals via the CAN interface
from the acquiring ECUs (engine and ABS
control units).

The ECU acquires the transmission-fluid
temperature as an analog input signal because
the properties of the fluid have a  significant
effect on shift quality, especially when the en-
gine is cold. The ECU acquires the position of
the selector lever in the form of a digital sig-
nal. The following information can also be
obtained and evaluated via the CAN inter-
face:
(cid:3) accelerator-pedal position 

(driver command),

(cid:3) kickdown switch,
(cid:3) engine temperature, and
(cid:3) engine torque.

2. Computer Core
The computer core comprises microcon-
troller, flash, RAM, EEPROM, analog-digital
converter, and CAN bus system.

3. Output Side
The output side features the driver stages for
the on/off valve, ASICs, current control
(CG205), and low-level signal driver stages.

BMW drivetrain ECU from 1983 

Drivetrain ECUs
MEG drivetrain ECUs (MEG = engine
ETC/EGAS transmission) are based on the
standard printed circuit board ECUs for
 engine and transmission, and are commonly
used in the USA. As the block diagram in
Figure 3 shows, the main advantage of this
ECU lies in the fact that specific electronic
components only have to be fitted once,
thereby reducing costs.

An MG ECU (MG = engine/transmis-

sion) was the first example of elec-
tronic transmission control to be
mass-produced. 
This ECU was devel-
oped back in 1983
for BMW for use
with a ZF 4HP22

mission (Figure 4).

end in sight to their development.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs)

ECUs for Electronic Transmission Control

Microhybrid ECUs
The introduction of new transmissions (such
as the ZF 6HP26) has seen a transformation
in the type of ECU from the PCB to the mi-
crohybrid. This development has been influ-
enced by the changing demands, mainly be-
cause of the environmental conditions under
which the ECU is used (Table 2).

The microhybrid ECU basically contains
the same circuitry as the PCB, but now with
unencapsulated semiconductor components
being used, i.e. as “bare” silicon chips.
 Electrical contacting is provided by wire
bonding (in the PCB ECU with soldering).

Technical limits for PCB and microhybrid

PCB

Microhybrid

Passive components are electrically  contacted
by means of conductive bonding agents.

In contrast to the currently mass-produced
circuits with LTCC (low-temperature cofired
ceramics), finer layout structures are used in
the new systems with 32-bit processors. This
relates in particular to the via  density and the
bondland size. 

The previous bondland grid of 450 μm would
require four bond rows and at least three
wiring layers to route the computer core.
With the via grid of 260 μm used, two bond
rows are sufficient, and this even with a re-
duced space requirement and only two wiring
layers.

Figure 7a shows the ABS computer bond
zones (44 bonds) on an LTCC standard sub-
strate compared with the 32-bit controller 
in the diesel-control system (240 bonds) on
LTCC-fine-line in Figure 7b. 

In addition, Figure 8 shows a comparison of
the wiring density of the inner layers (Figure
8a) and the reverse side of the hybrid with 
the integrated resistors (Figure 8b).

The following significant measures were
taken to bring about an improvement in the
process for microhybrid ECUs: 
(cid:3) use of finer punch needles, 
(cid:3) finer screens, 
(cid:3) adaptation of the pastes used, and 
(cid:3) tolerance optimization through adapted

process management.

This compression of the layout makes it pos-
sible to produce the circuit for transmission
control on an area measuring 2 x 1.2≤. In
other words, a substrate with the working for-
mat of 8 x 6≤ alone can process 20 circuits in
parallel.

For optimum cooling of ICs subject to high
heat loss, thermal vias with a diameter of 300
μm are filled in parallel to the function vias.
This increases the thermal conductivity of the
substrate from approx. 3 W/mK to  effectively
20 W/mK.

Figure 9 shows the complete microhybrid in
its housing. The following procedures are
used for the assembly process: 
(cid:3) All the components are bonded with

 conductive bonding agent.

(cid:3) Bonding is carried out using a 32 μm gold

wire and a 200 μm aluminum wire.

(cid:3) The hybrid is bonded to the steel plate with

heat-conducting bonding agent.

(cid:3) The connection to the glass bushing is
made by a 200 μm aluminum bond.
(cid:3) The housing is hermetically sealed tight.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs)

ECUs for Electronic Transmission Control

ASIC Chips
In addition to computer and memory chips,
application-specific integrated circuits make
up a significant proportion of the electronic
components in the ECUs. 

Different functions have been combined
into ASIC chips for the purpose of reducing
costs and standardizing the electronic design
of transmission-control systems. These ASICs
are available in encapsulated and
 unencapsulated form and used for both
 microhybrid and PCB ECUs. Transmission
control features various ASICs which are cur-
rently in volume production; the three ASICs
used in the microhybrid ECU are  discussed in
the following.

Current-Regulator ASIC CG205
The current-regulator ASIC CG205 with
 integrated shunt was developed for high-pre-
cision pressure control in the transmission. 
It achieves a control precision of 1% over the
entire temperature range.

Figure 10a shows the encapsulated ASIC, as is
used in PCB ECUs. 

There is also the option of adjusting the

current range and the PWM output fre-
quency with the aid of an external circuit.

Watchdog ASIC CG 120
Due to the fact that the 6-speed transmission
with integrated electronic module no longer
has a mechanical connection between the se-
lector lever and the transmission, the control
system requires specific safety mechanisms.
This function is performed by the ASIC
CG120 (Figure 10b), which monitors the
function of the microcontroller (see also the
chapter entitled “Diagnostic functions”). 
The ASIC CG120 performs the following
functions:

(cid:3) power supply with 5 or 3.3 V,
(cid:3) sensor supply,
(cid:3) watchdog,
(cid:3) serial interface,
(cid:3) CAN interface,
(cid:3) ISO 9141 interface, and
(cid:3) programmable via SPI interface.

I/O ASIC CG115
In order to achieve the high level of integra-
tion in the microhybrid, it is necessary to
combine as many functions as possible in 
one ASIC. Achieving this with individual
components would therefore take up too
much space on the substrate.

The following functions are integrated in the
I/O ASIC CG115 (Figure 10c):

(cid:3) voltage monitoring,
(cid:3) inputs and outputs for digital signal trans-

mission,

(cid:3) 2 inputs for inductive Hall-sensor signals,
(cid:3) 8-channel analog multiplexer,
(cid:3) serial interface, and
(cid:3) programmable via SPI interface.

Thermo-Management

Dissipating the heat losses generated in the
ECUs represents a prime consideration in the
design of mechatronic modules, particularly
in those cases where “hotspots” cause a highly
uneven distribution of the heat losses. Figure
1 shows the heat-dissipation model in an
ECU to the point of a heat sink which is situ-
ated in the valve housing in this example.
This is an LTCC microhybrid in a welded
steel housing which is mounted on the alu-
minum housing of the hydraulic main con-
trol stage.

Effective heat management of the IC neces-
sitates a close contact between the chips and
the housing. Materials with high thermal
conductivity are suitable for use in this re-
spect.

As other tests on the various substrates for

high-temperature applications have shown,
these materials demonstrate very different
thermal-conductivity properties. LTCC glass
ceramic shows itself to be less effective than
aluminum-oxide ceramic (Al2O3) by a factor
of almost 10. However, this drawback is com-
pensated by thermal vias in the microhybrid
to such an extent that LTCC technology
demonstrates equally good levels of thermal
conductivity as aluminum-oxide technology.

Figure 2 shows an area of thermal vias. 
The production process creates these heat-
dissipating thermal vias (heat spreaders) in
 parallel to the electrical connections.

Essentially, the terms “power loss”,  “depletion-
layer/junction temperature”, and “heat dissi-
pation” define the limits for a microhybrid
ECU. 

The power loss Pl can be described in
 simplified form for stationary operation
as follows:

The thermal resistance Rjth (auxiliary quan-

ters and the specific thermal conductivity 
of the material and is determined from 
measurements. The maximum permitted
junction temperature Tj determines the maxi-
mum permitted power loss Plmax, where 
Tj is dependent on the material (for silicon 
Tjmax = 150...200°C). Current specifications
laid down by microcontroller manufacturers
establish an upper limit of Tjmax = 150°C. 
Since Tj is also dependent on the design, a

consideration of design rules is important
for optimization of the junction tempera-
ture, e.g.:
(cid:3) Circuit sections subjected to thermal load
should not be designed in accordance
with the otherwise applicable minimum
criteria, rather affected driver-stage areas
(transistors/pn junctions), for example,
should be geometrically enlarged.

(cid:3) “Hotspots” should not be positioned in
the corners of the ICs, this enables the IC
substrate material to act in all directions
as a heat spreader.

The design of the ASICs for transmission
control described in the “ASIC Chips”
 section is suitable for maximum junction
temperatures of Tjmax = 175°C.

In relation to the complete microhybrid
 system, designers are working towards opti-
mizing the level of sophistication between
increasing IC size, using thermal vias, and
mounting on special substrates such as DBC
or PCs.

DBC (direct bonded copper): copper-coated
ceramic
and

resistance of aluminum oxide (Figure 3a)

Processes and Tools Used in
ECU Development

Simulation Tools
Simulation of individual components and of
the complete system is playing an increasingly
important role in improving and  stepping up
the development process. The advantages of
mathematical modeling over actual physical
models (prototypes) are as follows:
(cid:3) frequent reproducibility as desired,
(cid:3) deeper understanding of system behavior,
(cid:3) individual parameter analyses possible,
(cid:3) lower costs,
(cid:3) less time required for model modifications,

Circuit Simulation with SABER
Before a circuit is built with real components,
it is possible to test its function using the
SABER® simulation tool. Many component
manufacturers already offer the data on their
products in a SABER library for this purpose
(Figure 2). 

These data can be used to test the circuit with
regard to its robustness, thermal properties,
worst-case performance, and EMC behavior
and thereby facilitate any necessary circuit
optimization at a very early stage in its devel-
opment. 

and

(cid:3) flexible application in all technical fields.

This approach can reduce the number of
 redesigns.

The following text deals briefly with some
tools for simulation that are used.

Figure 1 shows by way of example the
thermo-simulation of a microhybrid ECU. 

It clearly shows the high temperature of the

hotspots in the electronic circuitry which in
this case occurs at a voltage regulator. This
simulation is used to optimize the positioning
of the thermal vias and the  distribution of the
components before the real ECU is built.

Modules for Transmission Control

Application

Modules for Transmission Control

Modules are compact function and
 constructional units that enable different
standardized components to be integrated
with the minimum component and space 
requirements and simplified interfaces.
 Hydraulic, electronic, and electrohydraulic
modules are available to suit the level of
 integration required.

Application

Mechatronic Modules
Since the number of sensors and actuators
deployed in the automatic transmission is in-
creasing while the amount of space available
to accommodate them is diminishing, the
drive towards ever-increasing integration 
suggests itself not just for cost reasons. 

Mechatronic modules can be used to com-

bine actuators and sensors, their contacting
and if necessary even an ECU into a single
control system. The level of integration, or
the scope, of a mechatronic module is dic-
tated by the requirements of the relevant 
vehicle manufacturer (Figure 1).

Improvement Potential
Modular technology offers comprehensive
potential for improvement in comparison
with individual components (Figure 2).

Modules exhibit the following advantages
over individual components:
(cid:3) reduced space requirement,
(cid:3) reduced mass,
(cid:3) fewer individual parts,
(cid:3) increased reliability,
(cid:3) standardization of the components
 integrated in the module, and thus 

(cid:3) reduced costs.

These advantages are essentially provided by
simplifications to the mechanical and electri-
cal interfaces between the individual compo-
nents and the transmission. There is in future
still further potential for reducing costs in
this field. 

However, any further increase in module
complexity could also lead to drawbacks; this
is because a manufacturer of modules must
demonstrate competence over the entire
spectrum of the components contained
therein. Since it is more difficult to separate
the components in the event of a fault, there
is the danger that increased follow-up costs
may be incurred in the event of both assem-
bly errors and repairs. Mechatronic systems
therefore place strict demands on quality and
reliability in the manufacturing process and
necessitate precautionary measures to ensure
that subsequent repairs can be  carried out.

Electronic Modules (EM)
Design
The next stage of development involves the
fusion of mechanics and electronics into the
mechatronic electronic module (EM), con-
sisting of sensors and ECU. In many cases,
it offers the possibility for system simplifica-
tion and cost reduction. 

Electronic modules already come in differ-
ent types and versions. What they all have in
common is their optimum adaptation to their
environment, as the examples in Figures 4 to
6 demonstrate.

Bosch module for ZF transmission
The highly developed transmission functions
with real-time calculations require a 32-bit
microcontroller (Motorola MPC555).
This means that up to 250 connections have to

4

Siemens-VDO electronic module

be routed, depending on the application.
As well as sensitive signal conditioning, the
electronic transmission-control system  requires 
(cid:3) power electronics with a high-precision

current regulator (1 A with 1% accuracy)
for pressure control and 

(cid:3) semiconductor relays for currents of

up to 8 A. 

Further functions are:
(cid:3) power supply, 
(cid:3) safety monitoring, and 
(cid:3) CAN bus system for data transfer.

The system also includes:
(cid:3) electrically actuated pressure-control valves

and solenoid valves,

(cid:3) position sensor,
(cid:3) rotational-speed sensors,
(cid:3) temperature sensor, and
(cid:3) transmission connector.

The environmental conditions which 
impact on the transmission pose a particular
challenge. 

The temperature temporarily reaches
140°C and acceleration values of up to 30 g
occur. In addition, the electronic circuitry is
completely immersed in transmission fluid,
which contains contaminants, abrasion parti-
cles, and chemical additives (see also chapter
entitled  “Automatic transmissions AT” sec-
tion “Automatic transmission luid/ATF”).

Antilock braking system

System overview

Antilock Braking System (ABS)

In hazardous driving conditions, it is possible
for the wheels of a vehicle to lock up under
braking. The possible causes include wet or
slippery road surfaces, and abrupt reaction
on the part of the driver (unexpected hazard).
The vehicle can become uncontrollable as a
result, and may go into a slip and/or leave the
road. The antilock braking system (ABS) de-
tects if one or more wheels are about to lock
up under braking and if so makes sure that
the brake pressure remains constant or is 
reduced. By so doing, it prevents the wheels
from locking up and the  vehicle remains
steerable. As a consequence the vehicle can 
be braked or stopped quickly and safely.  

System overview

The ABS braking system is based on the com-
ponents of the conventional system. Those
are 
(cid:3) the brake pedal (Fig. 1, 1),
(cid:3) the brake booster (2), 
(cid:3) the master cylinder (3),
(cid:3) the reservoir (4),
(cid:3) the brake lines (5) and hoses (6), and
(cid:3) the brakes and wheel-brake cylinders (7).

In addition there are also the following
 components: 
(cid:3) the wheel-speed sensors (8),
(cid:3) the hydraulic modulator (9), and
(cid:3) the ABS control unit (10).

The warning lamp (11) lights up if the ABS is
switched off.

Antilock braking system

System overview

355

Wheel-speed sensors
The speed of rotation of the wheels is an im-
portant input variable for the ABS control
system. Wheel-speed sensors detect the speed
of rotation of the wheels and pass the electri-
cal signals to the control unit. 

A car may have three or four wheel-speed
sensors depending on which version of the
ABS system is fitted (ABS system versions).
The speed signals are used to calculate the de-
gree of slip between the wheels and the road
surface and therefore detect whether any of
the wheels is about to lock up.

Electronic control unit (ECU)
The ECU processes the information received
from the sensors according to defined mathe-
matical procedures (control algorithms). The
results of those calculations form the basis for
the control signals sent to the  hydraulic mod-
ulator. 

Hydraulic modulator
The hydraulic modulator incorporates a se-
ries of solenoid valves that can open or close
the hydraulic circuits between the master
cylinder (Fig. 2, 1) and the brakes (4). In
 addition, it can connect the brakes to the
 return pump (6). Solenoid valves with two
hydraulic connections and two valve posi-
tions are used (2/2 solenoid valves). The  inlet
valve (7) between the master cylinder and the
brake controls pressure application, while the
outlet valve (8) between the brake and the re-
turn pump controls pressure release. There is
one such pair of solenoid valves for each
brake.

Under normal conditions, the solenoid valves
in the hydraulic modulator are at the “pres-
sure application” setting. That means the 
inlet valve is open. The hydraulic modulator
then forms a straight-through connection 
between the master cylinder and the brakes.
Consequently, the brake pressure generated 
in the master cylinder when the brakes are
applied is transmitted directly to the brakes at
each wheel. 

As the degree of brake slip increases due 
to braking on a slippery surface or heavy
braking, the risk of the wheels locking up 
also  increases. The solenoid valves are then
switched to the “maintain pressure” setting.
The connection between the master cylinder
and the brakes is shut off (inlet valve is
closed) so that any increase of pressure in the
master cylinder does not lead to a pressure
increase at the brakes.

If the degree of slip of any of the wheels in-

creases further despite this action, the pres-
sure in the brake(s) concerned must be re-
duced. To achieve this, the solenoid valves are
switched to the “pressure release” setting. The
inlet valve is still closed, and in addition, the
outlet valve opens to allow the return pump
integrated in the hydraulic modulator to
draw brake fluid from the brake(s) concerned
in a controlled manner. The pressure in the
relevant brake(s) is thus reduced so that
wheel lock-up does not occur.

Antilock braking system

Requirements placed on ABS

Requirements placed on ABS 

An ABS system must meet a comprehensive
range of requirements, in particular all the
safety requirements associated with dynamic
braking response and the braking-system
technology.

Handling stability and steerability
(cid:3) The braking control system should be

 capable of ensuring that the car retains 
its handling stability and steerability on 
all types of road surface (from dry roads
with good adhesion to black ice).

(cid:3) An ABS system should utilize the available
adhesion between the tires and the road
surface under braking to the maximum
possible degree, giving handling stability
and steerability precedence over minimiz-
ing braking distance. It should not make
any difference to the system whether the
driver applies the brakes violently or grad-
ually increases the braking force to the
point at which the wheels would lock.
(cid:3) The control system should be capable 

of adapting rapidly to changes in road-sur-
face grip, e.g. on a dry road with occasional
patches of ice, wheel lock-up on the ice
must be restricted to such short time spans
that handling stability and steerability are
not impaired. At the same time, it should
allow maximum utilization of adhesion
where the road is dry.

(cid:3) When braking under conditions where the
amount of available grip differs between
wheels (e.g. wheels on one side on ice, on
dry tarmac on the other – referred to as 
“μ-split” conditions), the unavoidable yaw
forces (turning forces around the vehicle’s
vertical axis which attempt to turn the
 vehicle sideways) should only be allowed 
to develop at a rate slow enough for the 
“average driver” to easily counteract them
by steering in the opposite direction.

(cid:3) When cornering, the vehicle should retain
its handling stability and steerability  under
braking and be capable of being braked to
a standstill as quickly as possible provided
its speed is sufficiently below the corner’s

limit speed (that is the absolute maximum
speed at which a vehicle can successfully
negotiate a bend of a given  radius with the
drive disengaged).

(cid:3) The system should also be able to ensure
that handling stability and steerability are
maintained and the best possible braking
effect obtained on a bumpy or uneven road
surface, regardless of the force with which
the driver applies the brakes.

(cid:3) Finally, the braking control system should
be able to detect aquaplaning (when the
wheels “float” on a film of water) and re-
spond appropriately to it. In so doing it
must be able to maintain vehicle controlla-
bility and course.

Effective range
(cid:3) The braking control system must be

 effective across the entire speed range of
the vehicle right down to crawling speed
(minimum speed limit approximately
2.5 km/h). If the wheels lock up below 
the minimum limit, the distance traveled
 before the vehicle comes to a halt is not
critical. 

Timing characteristics
(cid:3) Adjustments to take account of braking-
system hysteresis (delayed reaction to
 release of brakes) and the effects of the 
engine (when braking with the drive en-
gaged) must take as little time as possible. 
(cid:3) Pitching of the vehicle in response to sus-
pension vibration must be prevented. 

Reliability
(cid:3) There must be a monitoring circuit which
continuously checks that the ABS is func-
tioning correctly. If it detects a fault which
could impair braking characteristics, the
ABS should be switched off. A warning
lamp must then indicate to the driver that
the ABS is not functioning and only the 
basic braking system is available.

Figs. 1 and 2 show the physical interdepen-
dencies during a braking sequence with ABS.
The areas in which the ABS is active are
shaded blue.

Curves 1, 2 and 4 in Fig. 1 relate to road
conditions in which the level of adhesion and
therefore the braking force increases up to a
maximum limit as the brake pressure rises.
Increasing the brake pressure above that
maximum adhesion limit on a car without
ABS would constitute overbraking. When that
happens, the “sliding” proportion of the tire
footprint (the area of the tire in contact with
the road) increases so much as the tire de-
forms that the static friction diminishes and
the kinetic friction increases. 

The brake slip λ is a measure of the
 proportion of kinetic friction, whereby 
λ = 100% is the level at which the wheel locks
and only kinetic friction is present. 

λ =

(υF – υR)
υF

· 100%

indicates the degree to which the wheel’s
 circumferential speed, υR, lags behind the 
vehicle’s linear speed (road speed), υF.

From the progression shown in Fig. 1 of
curves 1 (dry conditions), 2 (wet conditions)
and 4 (black ice), it is evident that shorter
braking distances are achieved with ABS than
if the wheels are overbraked and lock up
(brake slip λ = 100%). Curve 3 (snow) shows
a different pattern whereby a wedge of snow
forms in front of the wheels when they lock
up and helps to slow the vehicle down; in 
this scenario, the advantage of ABS is in its
ability to maintain handling stability and
steerability.

As the two curves for coefficient of friction,
μHF, and lateral-force coefficient, μS, in Fig. 2
illustrate, the active range of the ABS has to
be extended for the large lateral slip angle of
α = 10° (i.e. high lateral force due to rapid

lateral acceleration of the vehicle) as com-
pared with the smaller lateral slip angle of 
α = 2°, that is to say, if the vehicle is braked
hard in a corner when the lateral acceleration
is high, the ABS cuts in sooner and  allows an
initial level of brake slip of, say, 10%. At α =
10°, an initial coefficient of  friction of only
μHF = 0.35 is obtained, while the lateral-force
coefficient is almost at its maximum at μS =
0.80. 

As the vehicle’s speed and therefore its
 lateral acceleration are reduced by braking
through the corner, the ABS is able to allow
increasingly higher levels of brake slip so that
the deceleration increases, while the  lateral-
force coefficient diminishes as the lateral 
acceleration reduces. 

Braking while cornering causes the braking
forces to rise so quickly that the overall brak-
ing distance is only marginally longer than
when braking in a straight line under identi-
cal conditions.

Controlled system
The data-processing operations performed by
the ABS control unit are based on the
 following simplified controlled system: 
(cid:3) a non-driven wheel, 
(cid:3) a quarter of the vehicle’s mass apportioned

to that wheel, 

(cid:3) the brake on that wheel and, representing

the friction pairing of tire and road surface,

(cid:3) a theoretical curve for coefficient of fric-

tion versus brake slip (Fig. 2). 

That curve is divided into a stable zone with 
a linear gradient and an unstable zone with 
a constant progression (μHFmax). As an addi-
tional simplification, there is also an assumed
initial straight-line braking response that is
equivalent to a panic braking reaction.

Fig. 3 shows the relationships between
 braking torque, MB (the torque that can be
generated by the brake through the tire), or
road-surface frictional torque, MR (torque
that acts against the wheel through the fric-
tion pairing of tire and road surface), and
time, t, as well as the relationships between
the wheel deceleration (a) and time, t,
whereby the braking torque increases in lin-
ear fashion over time. The road-surface fric-
tional torque lags slightly behind the braking
torque by the time delay, T, as long as the
braking sequence is within the stable zone of
the curve for friction coefficient versus brake
slip. After about 130 ms, the maximum level
(μHFmax) – and therefore the unstable zone –
of the curve for friction coefficient versus
brake slip is reached. From that point on, 
the curve for friction coefficient versus brake
slip states that while the braking torque, MB,
continues to rise at an undiminished rate, 
the road-surface frictional torque, MR, cannot
increase any further and remains constant. 
In the period between 130 and 240 ms (this 
is when the wheel locks up), the minimal
torque difference, MB – MR, that was present
in the stable zone rises rapidly to a high fig-
ure. That torque difference is a precise mea-
sure of the wheel deceleration (–a) of the
braked wheel (Fig. 3, bottom). In the stable

small rate, whereas in the unstable zone it 
increases rapidly. As a consequence, the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip re-
veals opposite characteristics in the stable 
and unstable zones. The ABS exploits those
opposing characteristics.

Antilock braking system

ABS control loop

Controlled variables for non-driven wheels
The wheel acceleration and deceleration are
generally suitable as controlled variables for
driven and non-driven wheels provided the
driver brakes with the clutch disengaged. The
reason can be found in the opposing charac-
teristics of the controlled system in the stable
and unstable zones of the curve for friction
coefficient versus brake slip. 

In the stable zone, the wheel deceleration is
limited to relatively low rates so that when the
driver presses harder on the brake pedal, the
car brakes harder without the wheels locking
up. 

In the unstable zone, on the other hand, the
driver only needs to apply slightly more pres-
sure to the brake pedal to induce instanta-
neous wheel lock-up. This characteristic
means that very often the wheel deceleration
and acceleration can be used to determine the
degree of brake slip for optimum braking. 
A fixed wheel deceleration threshold 
for initiation of the ABS control sequence
should only be fractionally above the maxi-
mum possible vehicle linear deceleration.
This is particularly important if the driver
initially only applies the brakes lightly but
then increasingly applies more pressure to 
the pedal. If the threshold is set too high, 
the wheels could then progress too far along
the curve for friction coefficient versus slip
into the unstable zone before the ABS detects
the imminent loss of control.

When the fixed threshold is initially
reached under heavy braking, the brake 
pressure at the wheel(s) concerned should
not automatically be reduced, because with
modern tires, valuable braking distance
would be lost on a surface with good grip, 
especially in cases where the initial speed 
is high. 

Controlled variables
An essential factor in determining the effec-
tiveness of an ABS control system is the
choice of controlled variables. The basis 
for that choice are the wheel-speed sensor sig-
nals from which the ECU calculates the decel-
eration/acceleration of the wheel, brake slip,
the reference speed and the vehicle decelera-
tion. On their own, neither the wheel deceler-
ation/acceleration nor the brake slip are suit-
able as controlled variables because, under
braking, a driven wheel behaves  entirely dif-
ferently to a non-driven wheel. However, by
combining those variables on the basis of ap-
propriate logical relationships, good results
can be obtained.

As brake slip is not directly measurable, the
ECU calculates a quantity that approximates
to it. The basis for the calculation is the refer-
ence speed, which represents the speed under
ideal braking conditions (optimum degree of
brake slip). So that speed can be determined,
the wheel-speed sensors continuously trans-
mit signals to the ECU for calculating the
speed of the wheels. The ECU takes the signals
from a pair of diagonally opposed wheels (e. g.
right front and left rear) and calculates the ref-
erence speed from them. Under partial brak-
ing, the faster of the two diagonally opposite
wheels generally determines the reference
speed. If the ABS cuts in under emergency
braking, the wheel speeds will be different
from the vehicle’s  linear speed and can thus
not be used for calculating the reference speed
without adjustment. During the ABS control
sequence, the ECU provides the reference
speed based on the speed at the start of the
control sequence and reduces it at a linear
rate. The gradient of the reference-speed
graph is determined by analyzing logical
 signals and relationships.

If, in addition to the wheel acceleration/ 
deceleration and the brake slip, the vehicle’s
linear deceleration is brought into the equa-
tion as an additional quantity, and if the logi-
cal circuit in the ECU is modulated by com-
putation results, then ideal brake control can
be achieved. That concept has been realized in
the Bosch Antilock Braking System (ABS).

Effectiveness of control
An efficient antilock braking system must
meet the criteria listed below for the standard
of control.
(cid:3) Maintenance of handling stability by

 provision of adequate lateral forces at the
rear wheels

(cid:3) Maintenance of steerability by provision of
adequate lateral forces at the front wheels

(cid:3) Reduction of braking distances as com-

pared with locked-wheel braking by opti-
mum utilization of the available adhesion
between tires and road surface

(cid:3) Rapid adjustment of braking force to dif-
ferent friction coefficients, for instance
when driving through puddles or over
patches of ice or compacted snow.
(cid:3) Ensuring application of low braking-
torque control amplitudes to prevent
 suspension vibration

(cid:3) High degree of user-friendliness due to

minimal pedal feedback (“pedal judder”)
and low levels of noise from the actuators
(solenoid valves and return pump in the
hydraulic modulator).

The criteria listed can only be optimized
 collectively rather than individually. Never-
theless, vehicle handling stability and steer-
ability are always among the top priorities.

Initial braking phase for a non-driven wheel and 
a driving wheel connected to the drivetrain

Controlled variables for driven wheels
If first or second gear is engaged when the
brakes are applied, the engine acts on the dri-
ven wheels and substantially increases their
effective mass moment of inertia ΘR, i. e. the
wheels behave as if they were considerably
heavier. The sensitivity with which the wheel
deceleration responds to changes in the 
braking torque in the unstable zone of the
curve for friction coefficient versus brake slip
diminishes to an equal extent. 

The starkly opposing characteristics dis-
played by non-driven wheels in the stable and
unstable zone of the curve for friction coeffi-
cient versus brake slip are evened out to a
substantial degree, so that in this situation the
wheel deceleration is often insufficient as a
controlled variable for identifying the degree
of brake slip offering the greatest possible
friction. It is necessary instead to introduce as
an additional controlled variable a quantity
that approximates to brake slip and to com-
bine it in a suitable manner with the wheel
deceleration.

Fig. 4 compares an initial braking sequence
on a non-driven wheel and on a driving
wheel that is connected to the drivetrain. 
In this example, the engine’s inertia increases
the effective wheel inertia by a factor of four.
On the non-driven wheel, a specific threshold
for deceleration (–a)1 is exceeded very soon
after leaving the stable zone of the curve for
friction coefficient versus brake slip. Because
it has a moment of inertia that is four times
greater, the driven wheel requires a torque
difference four times as big

ΔM2 = 4 · ΔM1

to exceed the threshold (–a)2. Consequently,
the driven wheel may by then have progressed
a long way into the unstable zone of the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip, re-
sulting in impaired vehicle  handling stability.

Typical control cycles

Control cycle on surfaces with good grip
(High coefficient of friction) 
If the ABS sequence is activated on a road
surface with good grip (high coefficient of
friction), the subsequent pressure rise must
be 5 to 10 times slower than in the initial
braking phase in order to prevent undesirable
suspension vibration. That requirement pro-
duces the control-cycle progression for high
coefficients of friction illustrated in Fig. 1. 

As a result, the relevant solenoid valve
switches to the “maintain pressure” setting. 
At this point the brake pressure must not be
reduced, because the threshold (–a) might be
exceeded within the stable zone of the curve
for friction coefficient versus brake slip and
then potential braking distance would be
“wasted”. At the same time, the  reference
speed, υRef, reduces according to a defined
linear gradient. The reference speed is used as
the basis for determining the slip switching
threshold, λ1. 

During the initial phase of braking, the brake
pressure at the wheel and the rate of wheel
deceleration (negative acceleration) rise. At
the end of phase 1, the wheel deceleration
passes the set threshold level (–a). 

At the end of phase 2, the wheel speed, υR,
drops below the λ1 threshold. At that point, 
the solenoid valves switch to the “reduce 
pressure” setting so that the pressure drops, 
and they remain at that setting as long as the

wheel deceleration is above the threshold 
(–a). 

At the end of phase 3, the deceleration rate
falls below the threshold (–a) again and a
pressure-maintenance phase of a certain
length follows. During that period, the wheel
acceleration has increased so much that the
threshold (+a) is passed. The pressure contin-
ues to be maintained at a constant level. 

At the end of phase 4, the wheel acceleration
exceeds the relatively high threshold level
(+A). The brake pressure then increases for as
long as the acceleration remains above the
threshold (+A).

In phase 6, the brake pressure is once again
held constant because the acceleration is
above the threshold (+a). At the end of this
phase, the wheel acceleration falls below the
threshold (+a). This is an indication that the
wheel has returned to the stable zone of the
curve for friction coefficient versus brake slip
and is now slightly underbraked. 

The brake pressure is now increased in 
stages (phase 7) until the wheel deceleration
passes the threshold (–a) (end of phase 7).
This time, the brake pressure is reduced
 immediately without a λ1 signal being
 generated.

threshold, the brake pressure is reduced over
a short, fixed period. 

A further short pressure-maintenance
phase follows. Then, once again, the wheel
speed is compared to the slip switching
threshold λ1 and, as a consequence, the
 pressure reduced over a short, fixed period.
In the following pressure-maintenance
phase, the wheel starts to accelerate again
and its  acceleration exceeds the threshold
(+a). This results in another pressure-main-
tenance phase which lasts until the accelera-
tion drops below the threshold (+a) again
(end of phase 5). In phase 6, the incremental
pressure-increase pattern seen in the preced-
ing section takes place again until, in phase 7,
pressure is released and a new control cycle
starts.

Control cycle on slippery surfaces 
(low coefficient of friction) 
In contrast with good grip conditions, on 
a slippery road surface even very light pres-
sure on the brake pedal is frequently enough
to make the wheels lock up. They then re-
quire much longer to emerge from a high-
slip phase and accelerate again. The process-
ing logic of the ECU detects the prevailing
road conditions and adapts the ABS re-
sponse characteristics to suit. Fig. 3 shows 
a typical control cycle for road conditions
with low levels of adhesion.

In phases 1 to 3, the control sequence is
the same as for high-adhesion conditions. 

Phase 4 starts with a short pressure-main-

tenance phase. Then, within a very short
space of time, the wheel speed is compared
with the slip switching threshold λ1. As the
wheel speed is lower than the slip switching

Antilock braking system

Typical control cycles

365

In the cycle described above, the control logic
detected that following pressure release –
triggered by the signal (–a) – two more 
pressure-reduction stages were necessary to
induce the wheel to accelerate again. 
The wheel remains in the higher-slip zone for
a relatively long period, which is not ideal for
handling stability and steerability.

In order to improve those two characteris-

tics, this next control cycle and those that 
follow incorporate continual comparison of
wheel speed with the slip switching threshold
λ1. As a consequence, the brake pressure is
continuously reduced in phase 6 until, in
phase 7, the wheel acceleration exceeds the
threshold (+a). Because of that continuous
pressure release, the wheel retains a high level
of slip for only a short period so that vehicle
handling and steerability are improved in
comparison with the first control cycle.

Control cycle with yaw-moment 
buildup delay
When the brakes are applied in situations
where the grip conditions differ significantly
between individual wheels (“μ-split” condi-
tions) – for example, if the wheels on one side
of the car are on dry tarmac while those on
the other side are on ice – vastly different
braking forces will be produced at the front
wheels (Fig. 4). That difference in braking
force creates a turning force (yaw moment)
around the vehicle’s vertical axis. It also gener-
ates steering feedback effects of varying types
dependent on the vehicle’s kingpin offset.
With a positive kingpin offset, corrective
steering is made more difficult, while a nega-
tive kingpin offset has a stabilizing effect.

Heavy cars tend to have a relatively long
wheelbase and a high level of inertia around
the vertical axis. With vehicles of this type,
the yaw effect develops slowly enough for the
driver to react and take corrective steering 
action during ABS braking. Smaller cars with
short wheelbases and lower levels of  inertia,
on the other hand, require an ABS system
supplemented by a yaw-moment buildup 
delay (GMA system) to make them equally
controllable under emergency braking in
conditions where there are wide differences 
in grip between individual wheels. Develop-
ment of the yaw moment can be inhibited by
delayed pressure increase in the brake on the
front wheel that is on the part of the road 
offering the higher level of adhesion (the
“high” wheel).

Fig. 5 (overleaf) illustrates the principle of 
the yaw-moment buildup delay: 
Curve 1 shows the brake pressure, p, in the
master cylinder. Without yaw-moment
buildup delay, the wheel on the tarmac
quickly reaches the pressure phigh (curve 2)
and the wheel on the ice, the pressure plow
(curve 5). Each wheel is braked with the
 specific maximum possible deceleration
 (individually controlled).

GMA 1 system
On vehicles with less extreme handling charac-
teristics, the GMA 1 system is used. With this
system, during the initial phases of braking
(curve 3), as soon as the pressure is reduced for
the first time at the “low” wheel  because this
shows a tendency to lock up, the brake pres-
sure at the “high” wheel is increased in stages.
Once the brake pressure at the “high” wheel
reaches its lock-up point, it is no longer af-
fected by the signals from the “low” wheel, and
is individually controlled so that it is able to
utilize the maximum possible braking force.
This method gives the type of vehicle referred
to satisfactory steering characteristics under
emergency braking on surfaces offering un-
equal grip to individual wheels. 
As the maximum brake pressure at the “high”
wheel is reached within a relatively short 
time (750 ms), the braking distance is only
marginally longer than for vehicles without a
yaw-moment buildup delay facility.

GMA 2 system
The GMA 2 system is used on vehicles with
more extreme handling characteristics. With
this system, as soon as the brake pressure at
the “low” wheel is reduced, the ABS solenoid
valves for the “high” wheel are directed to
maintain and then reduce the pressure for 
a specific period (Fig. 5, curve 4). Renewed
pressure increase at the “low” wheel then trig-
gers incremental increase of pressure at the
“high” wheel, though with pressure-increase
periods a certain amount longer than for the
“low” wheel. This pressure metering takes
place not only in the first control cycle but
throughout the braking sequence.

The effect of the yaw moment on steering
characteristics is all the more exaggerated the
greater the speed of the vehicle when the
brakes are first applied. The GMA 2 system
divides the vehicle speed into four ranges. 
In each of those ranges, the yaw moment 
is inhibited to differing degrees. In the high
speed ranges, the pressure-increase periods at
the “high” wheel are progressively shortened,
while the pressure-decrease periods at the
“low” wheel are progressively lengthened in
order to achieve effective inhibition of yaw-
moment generation at high vehicle speeds.
Fig. 5 below compares the steering angle pro-
gression necessary for maintaining a straight
course under braking without GMA (curve 6)
and with GMA (curve 7). 

Another important aspect with regard 
to GMA usage is the vehicle’s response to
braking in a corner. If the driver brakes when
cornering at a high speed, the GMA increases
the dynamic load on the front wheels while
reducing it at the rear. As a  result, the lateral
forces acting on the front wheels become
stronger while those acting on the rear wheels
diminish. This generates a turning moment
towards the inside of the bend as a result of
which the vehicle slews off its line towards the
inside of its intended course and is very diffi-
cult to bring back  under control (Fig. 6a). 

Antilock braking system

Typical control cycles

367

The ideal method of inhibiting yaw-moment
buildup involves a compromise between good
steering characteristics and suitably short
braking distance and is developed by Bosch
individually for a specific vehicle model
through consultation with the manufacturer. 

In order to avoid this critical response to
braking, the GMA also takes the lateral accel-
eration into account. The GMA is deactivated
at high lateral acceleration rates. As a result, a
high braking force is generated at the outside
front wheel during the initial phase of brak-
ing in a corner and creates a turning moment
towards the outside of the bend. That turning
moment balances out the turning moment
acting in the opposite direction that is pro-
duced by the lateral forces, so that the vehicle
slightly understeers and thus remains easily
controllable (Fig. 6).

Antilock braking system

Typical control cycles

Control cycle for four-wheel-drive
 vehicles
The most important criteria for assessing the
various types of four-wheel-drive configura-
tion (Fig. 7) are traction, dynamic handling,
and braking characteristics. As soon as differ-
ential locks are engaged, conditions are cre-
ated that demand a different  response from
the ABS system. 

When a rear-axle differential is locked, the
rear wheels are rigidly interconnected, i.e.
they always rotate at the same speed and re-
spond to the braking forces (at each wheel)
and friction levels (between each tire and the
road surface) as if they were a single rigid
body. The “select low” mode that would
 otherwise be adopted for the rear wheels

7

Four-wheel-drive configurations

(whereby the wheel with the lower degree of
adhesion, μHF, determines the brake pressure
for both rear wheels) is thus canceled, and
both rear wheels utilize the maximum brak-
ing force. As soon as the inter-axle lock is en-
gaged, the system forces the front wheels to
assume the same average speed as the rear
wheels. All four wheels are then dynamically
interlinked and the engine drag (engine brak-
ing effect when backing off the throttle) and
inertia act on all four wheels. 

In order to ensure optimum ABS effectiveness
under those conditions, additional features
have to be incorporated according to the type
of four-wheel-drive system (Fig. 7) in use.

Four-wheel-drive system 1
On four-wheel-drive system 1 with manual
locks or permanently active viscous locks in
the propeller shaft and the rear-axle differen-
tial, the rear wheels are rigidly interconnected
and the average speed of the front wheels is
the same as that of the rear wheels. As already
mentioned, the rear differential lock results in
deactivation of the “select low” mode for the
rear wheels and utilization of the maximum
braking force at each rear wheel. When brak-
ing on road surfaces with unequal levels of
grip at the two rear wheels, this can generate a
yaw moment with a potentially critical effect
on vehicle handling stability. If the maximum
braking force difference were also applied
very quickly at the front wheels, it would not 
be possible to keep the vehicle on a stable
course. 

This type of four-wheel-drive arrangement
therefore requires a GMA system for the front
wheels in order to ensure handling stability
and steerability are maintained in road condi-
tions where there is a significant divergence
between the levels of grip at the left and right
wheels. In order to maintain ABS effective-
ness on slippery surfaces, the engine drag 
effect – which of course acts on all four
wheels on a four-wheel-drive vehicle – has to
be reduced. This is done by using an engine
drag-torque control system that applies just
enough throttle to counteract the unwanted
engine braking effect.

Another factor that demands refinement of

the ABS control cycle in order to prevent
wheel lock-up is the reduced sensitivity of the
wheels to changes in road-surface adhesion
on slippery surfaces that is caused by the 
effect of the engine inertia. The fact that all
four wheels are dynamically linked to the en-
gine’s inertial mass therefore requires addi-
tional analysis and processing operations on
the part of the ABS control unit. The vehicle
longitudinal deceleration is calculated to 
detect smooth or slippery road surfaces where
μHF is less than 0.3. 

When analyzing braking on such surfaces, 
the response threshold (–a) for wheel deceler-
ation is halved and the diminishing rise 
in the reference speed is limited to specific,
 relatively low levels. As a result, imminent
wheel lock-up can be detected early and 
“sensitively”.

On four-wheel-drive vehicles, heavy
 application of the throttle on slippery road
surfaces can cause all four wheels to spin. 
In such situations, special signal-processing
methods ensure that the reference speed can
only increase in response to the spinning
wheels within the limits of the maximum
possible vehicle acceleration. In a subsequent
braking sequence, the initial ABS pressure 
reduction is triggered by a signal (–a) and a
specific, minimal difference in wheel speed.

Four-wheel-drive system 2
Because of the possibility of all four wheels
spinning with four-wheel-drive system 2 
(viscous lock with freewheel in the propeller
shaft, proportional rear-axle differential
lock), the same special procedures must 
be adopted for signal processing. 

Other modifications for ensuring ABS 
effectiveness are not necessary as the free-
wheel disengages the wheels under braking.
However, the system can be improved by the
use of an engine drag-torque control system. 

Four-wheel-drive system 3 
As with the first two systems, four-wheel-
drive system 3 (automatic differential/inter-
axle locks) requires adoption of the signal
processing procedures described above in the
event of wheel-spin at all four wheels. 
In addition, automatic release of the differen-
tial locks whenever the brakes are applied is
necessary. Other modifications for ensuring
ABS effectiveness are not necessary.

Traction control system

Tasks, function description

Traction Control System (TCS)

Critical driving situations can occur not only
while braking, but also whenever strong lon-
gitudinal forces should be transferred at the
contact area between the tire and the ground.
This is because the transferable lateral forces
are reduced by this process. Critical situa-
tions can also occur when starting off and 
accelerating, particularly on a slippery road
surface, on hills, and when cornering. These
kinds of situations can overtax the driver not
only causing him/her to react incorrectly but
also causing the vehicle to become unstable. 
The traction control system (TCS) solves
these problems, providing the vehicle
 remains within the physical limits.

Tasks 

The antilock braking system (ABS) prevents
the wheels from locking up when the brakes
are applied by lowering the wheel brake pres-
sures. The traction control system (TCS) pre-
vents the wheels from spinning by reducing
the drive torque at each driven wheel. TCS
therefore provides a logical extension of ABS
during acceleration. 

In addition to this safety-relevant task 
of ensuring the stability and steerability 
of the vehicle when accelerating, TCS also 
improves the traction of the vehicle by regu-

Drive concept of a single-axle driven vehicle with TCS

lating the optimum slip (see μ-slip curve in
“Basic principles of vehicle dynamics”). 
The upper limit here is, of course, set by the
traction requirement stipulated by the driver.

Function description

Unless otherwise stated, all the following de-
scriptions refer to single-axle driven vehicles
(Fig. 1). It makes no difference whether the
vehicle is rear-wheel or front-wheel drive.

Drive slip and what causes it 
If the driver presses the accelerator when the
clutch is engaged, the engine torque will rise.
The drive axle torque MKar also increases. This
torque is distributed to both driven wheels in 
a ratio of 50 : 50 via the transversal differential
(Fig. 1). If this increased torque can be trans-
ferred completely to the road surface, the 
vehicle will accelerate unhindered. However, if 
the drive torque MKar/2 at one driven wheel 
exceeds the maximum drive torque that can be
transferred, the wheel will spin. The transfer-
able motive force is therefore  reduced and the
vehicle becomes unstable due to the loss of 
lateral stability.

The TCS regulates the slip of the driven
wheels as quickly as possible to the optimum
level. To do this the system first determines 
a reference value for the slip. This value
 depends on a number of factors which are in-
tended to represent the current driving situa-
tion as closely as possible. These factors in-
clude:
(cid:3) the basic characteristic for TCS reference

slip (based on the slip requirement of a tire
during acceleration),

(cid:3) effective coefficient of friction,
(cid:3) external tractive resistance (deep snow,

rough road, etc.),

(cid:3) yaw velocity, lateral acceleration, and steer-

ing angle of the vehicle.

TCS interventions
The measured wheel speeds and the respective
drive slip can be influenced by changing the
torque balance MGes at each driven wheel. 
The torque balance MGes at each wheel results
from the drive torque MKar/2 at this wheel, the
respective braking torque MBr and the road
torque MStr (Fig. 1).

MGes = MKar/2 + MBr + MStr
(MBr and MStr are negative here.)

This balance can obviously by influenced by
the drive torque MKar provided by the engine
as well as by the braking torque MBr. Both
these parameters are therefore correcting
variables of the TCS which can be used to
regulate the slip at each wheel to the reference
slip level. 

In gasoline-engine vehicles, the drive
torque MKar can be controlled using the
 following engine interventions:
(cid:3) Throttle valve (throttle valve adjustment),
(cid:3) Ignition system (ignition-timing advance),
(cid:3) Fuel-injection system (phasing out

 individual injection pulses).

Traction control system

Function description

371

The last two interventions are rapid 
interventions, the first a slower means 
of intervention (Fig. 2). The availability of
these  interventions depends on the vehicle
manufacturer and engine version. 

In diesel-engine vehicles, the drive torque
MKar is influenced by the electronic diesel
control system (EDC) (reduction of the
quantity of fuel injected).

The braking torque MBr can be regulated 
for each wheel via the braking system. 
The TCS function requires the original ABS
 hydraulic system to be expanded because 
of the need for active pressure build-up 
(see also “Hydraulic modulator”). 

Fig. 2 compares the response times with
 various TCS interventions. The figure 
shows that exclusive drive torque regulation
by means of the throttle valve can be unsatis-
factory due to the relatively long response
time.

Traction control system

Structure of traction control system

Structure of traction control
system (TCS)

The expanded ABS hydraulic system allows
both symmetrical brake application (i. e.
brake application at both driven wheels) 
as well as individual brake application. This is
the key to further structuring of the TCS, i.e.
structuring according to controlled variable
rather than according to the actuator (en-
gine/brake).

Drive axle speed controller
The drive axle speed υKar or the drive torque
MKar can be influenced by means of engine
interventions. Symmetric brake applications
also influence the drive axle speed υKar and 
effect torque balance between the individual
wheels in the same way as reducing the drive
torque MKar. The drive axle speed controller
is used to regulate the drive axle speed in this
way.

Transversal differential lock controller
Asymmetric brake application (brake 
application at just one driven wheel) is used
primarily to regulate the differential speed 
at the driven axle υDif = υL – υR. This task is
carried out by the differential speed controller.
Asymmetric brake application at just one 

driven wheel is only noticeable at first in the
torque balance of this wheel. The brake appli-
cation has basically the same effect as an
asymmetric distribution ratio of the transver-
sal differential (but applied to a drive torque
MKar that is reduced by the asymmetric brak-
ing torque). The differential speed controller
is also referred to as the transversal differential
lock controller because it can be used to influ-
ence to a certain extent the distribution ratio
of the transversal differential, i. e. to mimic the
effect of a differential lock.

Together the drive axle speed controller and
transversal differential lock controller form
the TCS system (Fig. 3). The drive axle speed
controller uses the drive axle speed υKar to
regulate the drive torque MKar provided by 
the engine. The transversal differential lock
controller functions primarily like a con-
troller that uses the differential speed υDif
to regulate the distribution ratio ML to MR of
the transversal differential and therefore the
distribution of the drive torque MKar to the
driven wheels.

Typical control situations

373

Typical control situations

Split: Transversal differential lock
 controller
Fig. 4 shows a typical situation (“μ-split”)
whereby the transversal differential lock con-
troller of the TCS becomes active when the
vehicle pulls away after being stationary. The
left side of the vehicle is on a slippery road
surface with a low coefficient of friction μl
(“l” for low) and the right side of the vehicle
is on dry asphalt with a considerably higher
coefficient of friction μh (“h” for high). 

Without brake application by the trans-
versal differential lock controller only the
drive force Fl could be transferred on both
sides since the differential distributes the
drive torque equally on both sides. A greater
drive torque MKar causes the wheel on the
side with μl to spin and leads to a differential
speed of υDif > 0 (see also Fig. 5). In this
case, the excess drive torque is lost as lost
torque in the differential, engine, and trans-
mission. 

To prevent the wheel on the side of the
 vehicle with μl from spinning if the drive
torque is too high, the braking force FBr
is applied (Fig. 4, see also Fig. 5). The differ-
ential can then transfer the force FBr + Fl to
this side (or a torque corresponding to this
force), whereby FBr is diffused by the brake
action. The drive force Fl remains as before.
On the side of the vehicle with μh the force

FBr + Fl is also transferred (characteristic 
of the differential). Since the brakes are not
applied on this side, the entire force can be
used as drive force FBr* + Fl (FBr* results
from FBr taking the different effective radii
into account). Overall the drive force trans-
ferred is increased by FBr* (the drive torque
MKar must of course also be increased ac-
cordingly). This ability of the transversal
 differential lock controller to increase the
traction is part of the traction control sys-
tem (TCS).

The drive torque can be regulated to a
maximum possible drive force. The value 
of μh represents a physical upper limit.

When both driven wheels run synchro-

nously again (υDif = 0), the single-sided
braking force FBr or the corresponding brak-
ing torque MBr is reduced again (Fig. 5).

The exact buildup and reduction of MBr de-
pends on the internal implementation of the
transversal differential lock controller (the
controller functions like a PI-controller).

Low: Drive axle speed controller
If both driven wheels are on a slippery road
surface with a low coefficient of friction 
(e.g. the vehicle is standing on ice) when 
the vehicle pulls away, the drive axle speed
controller of the TCS becomes active.

Traction control system

Typical control situations, traction control system for four wheel drive vehicles

If the driver increases the driver-specified
torque MFahVorga, the drive torque MKar in-
creases almost simultaneously. Both driven
wheels then spin at almost the same speed.
The differential speed υDif = υL – υR is ap-
proximately 0, while the drive axle speed 
υKar = (υL + υR)/2 = υL = υR is considerably
greater than a reasonable reference value
υSoKar determined by the TCS due to the 
spinning driven wheels. The drive axle 
speed controller reacts by reducing the drive
torque MKar to a level below the torque speci-
fied by the driver MFahVorga and by initiating
brief, symmetric brake application MBr, Sym
(Fig. 6). As a result the drive axle speed υKar is
reduced and thus the speed of the spinning
wheels. The vehicle begins to accelerate. Since
the optimum point of the μ-slip curve (see
also “Basic principles of vehicle dynamics”)
would not be achieved without these TCS in-
terventions, the acceleration would be slower
while the wheels were  spinning and consider-
ably less lateral  stability would be present.
The exact characteristic of MKar and
MBr, Sym depends in turn on the internal
 implementation of the drive axle speed

Traction control system (TCS)
for four wheel drive  vehicles

In recent years four wheel drive vehicles have
continued to increase in popularity. Amongst
these types of vehicles, Sport Utility Vehicles,
or SUVs, are the most popular of all. These
are road vehicles with off-road characteristics.

If all four wheels of a vehicle are to be 
driven, both a second transversal differential
and an additional longitudinal differential
(also called a central differential) are required
(Fig. 7). The first task of the longitudinal dif-
ferential is to compensate for the differences
between the drive axle speed of the front and
rear axle υKar, VA and υKar, HA, respectively. 
A rigid connection would result in tension
between the front and rear axle. The second
task is to achieve optimum distribution of the
drive torque MKar to the two axles MKar, VA and
MKar, HA, respectively.

Less expensive SUVs are often equipped with
a longitudinal differential with a preset distrib-
ution ratio. Unlike with a transversal differen-
tial, fixed distribution ratios other than 50:50
are useful – e.g. 60:40 for a design with em-
phasis on the rear-wheel drive of the vehicle.
Brake application by the traction control sys-
tem (TCS) can be used to mimic the behavior
of a longitudinal differential lock. 

By applying the brakes to eliminate part 
of MKar, VA, the distribution ratio MKar, HA to
MKar, VA can be increased, or can be decreased
by applying the brakes to eliminate part of
MKar, HA. The principle is the same as previ-
ously described for the transversal differential
lock or transversal differential. The only dif-
ference is that the braking torque of the TCS
does not have to be asymmetric, (i. e. at one
wheel of the driven axle) but can occur sym-
metrically at both wheels of a driven axle.
Moreover, the longitudinal differential lock
controller regards the two drive axle speeds
υKar, VA and υKar, HA as input parameters rather
than the speed difference of the left and right
wheel of the driven axle (transversal differen-
tial lock controller, see above).

Fig. 8 shows the expansion of the TCS
 concept from Fig. 3 for an all-wheel drive
 vehicle. As with a single-axle driven vehicle,
the drive axle speed controller uses the drive
axle speed υKar to regulate the drive torque
MKar provided by the engine. As already de-
scribed, the longitudinal differential lock
controller distributes this torque to the front
and rear axle (MKar, VA and MKar, HA, respec-
tively). The transversal
differential lock con-
troller uses the differ-
ential speed υDif, XA to
regulate the distribu-
tion of the drive
torque MKar, XA per axle
to the driven wheels.
This must now be car-
ried out for both the
front and rear axle
(“X” = “V” (front) or
“X” = “H” (rear)).

they do not require additional hardware.
There are therefore very cost-efficient. They

conditions are therefore often fitted with me-

Basic principles of automotive control engineering

Many subsystems of a driving safety system
(e. g. ESP) influence the driving dynamics of 
a vehicle by means of a controller i. e., they
form a control loop together with the relevant
components of the vehicle. 

Control loop
A simple standard control loop consists 
of controllers and a controlled system. The
 objective is to influence the characteristic of
the parameter yactual (controlled variable) of 
the controlled system using the controller
such that the parameter follows a reference
characteristic yref as closely as possible. To do
this the controlled variable is measured and
passed to the controller. The actual value of
the controlled variable is constantly compared
with the current reference value by generating
the control variance e = yref – yactual. 

The main task of the controller is to deter-
mine a suitable value for the correcting vari-
able u for every control variance e so that the

control variance is decreased, i. e., yactual = yref
at least approximately.

This task may be made more difficult by
 unknown natural dynamics of the controlled
system and other external factors z, which also
influence the controlled system. 

Example: TCS transversal differential 
lock controller
The principle of a control loop can be ex-
plained using the transversal differential lock
controller of the TCS system as an example.
The controlled variable yactual = υDif is the differ-
ential speed of the two wheels of a driven axle.
The reference value υSoDif is determined by the
TCS and adapted to the current driving situa-
tion. When driving straight ahead, this value is
typically 0. The asymmetric braking torque is
used as a correcting variable to influence the
controlled variable. The controlled system is
the vehicle itself which is affected by external
influences such as changing road surfaces.

The degree of counter-reaction of these
 controllers increases the greater the control
variance (P-controller), the longer the control
variance lasts (I-controller) or the greater the
tendency of the control variance to change 
(D-controller). Combining these basic con-
trollers gives PI, PD and PID-controllers.

The transversal differential lock controller of
the traction control system (TCS) is designed
as a PI-controller that contains additional non-
linear elements.

Electronic stability program

Requirements

Electronic Stability Program (ESP)

Human error is the cause for a large portion
of road accidents. Due to external circum-
stances, such as an obstacle suddenly appear-
ing on the road or driving at inappropriately
high speeds, the vehicle can reach its critical
limits and it becomes uncontrollable. The lat-
eral acceleration forces acting on the vehicle
reach values that overtax the driver. Elec-
tronic systems can make a major contribu-
tion towards increasing driving safety.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is 
a closed-loop system designed to improve ve-
hicle handling and braking response through
programmed intervention in the braking sys-
tem and/or drivetrain. The integrated func-
tionality of the ABS prevents the wheels from
locking when the brakes are applied, while
TCS inhibits wheel spin during acceleration.
In its role as an overall system, ESP applies a
unified, synergistic concept to control the ve-
hicle’s tendency to “plow” instead of obeying
the helm during attempted steering correc-
tions; and at the same time it maintains sta-
bility to prevent the vehicle breaking away to
the side, provided the  vehicle remains within
its physical limits.

Requirements

ESP enhances driving safety by providing the
following assets:
(cid:3) Enhanced vehicle stability; the system

keeps the vehicle on track and improves 
directional stability under all operating
conditions, including emergency stops,
standard braking maneuvers, coasting,
 acceleration, trailing throttle (overrun),
and load shift

(cid:3) Increased vehicle stability at the limits 

of traction, such as during sharp steering
maneuvers (panic response), to reduce the
danger of skidding or breakaway.

(cid:3) In a variety of different situations, further
improvements in the exploitation of trac-
tion potential when ABS and TCS come
into action, and when engine drag torque
control is active, by automatically increas-
ing engine speed to inhibit excessive engine
braking. The ultimate effects are shorter
braking distances and greater  traction
along with enhanced stability and higher
levels of steering response.

Tasks and method of operation

Tasks and method 
of operation 

The electronic stability program is a system
that relies on the vehicle’s braking system as a
tool for “steering” the vehicle. When the sta-
bility-control function assumes operation it
shifts the priorities that govern the brake sys-
tem. The basic function of the wheel brakes –
to decelerate and/or stop the vehicle – as-
sumes secondary importance as ESP inter-
venes to keep the vehicle stable and on
course, regardless of the conditions.

Specific braking intervention is directed 
at individual wheels, such as the inner rear
wheel to counter understeer, or the outer
front wheel during oversteer, as shown in 
Fig. 2. For optimal implementation of stabil-
ity objectives, ESP not only initiates braking
intervention, but it can also intervene on the
engine side to accelerate the  driven wheels. 

Because this “discriminatory” control concept
relies on two individual intervention strate-
gies, the system has two options for steering
the vehicle: it can brake selected wheels 
(selective braking) or accelerate the driven
wheels. Within the invariable limits imposed
by the laws of physics, ESP keeps the vehicle
on the road and reduces the risk of accident
and overturning. The system enhances road
safety by furnishing the driver with effective
support.

Below are four examples comparing vehicles
with and without ESP during operation “on
the limit”. Each of the portrayed driving ma-
neuvers reflects actual operating conditions,
and is based on simulation programs de-
signed using data from vehicle testing. The
results have been confirmed in subsequent
road tests.

Maneuvers

Rapid steering and countersteering
This maneuver is similar to lane changes 
or abrupt steering inputs such as might be
expected for instance
(cid:3) when a vehicle is moving too fast when 
it enters a series of consecutive S-bends,
(cid:3) or which have to be initiated when, with
oncoming traffic, an obstacle suddenly
appears on a country road, or

(cid:3) which are necessary when an overtaking
maneuver on the highway or freeway
 suddenly has to be aborted.

(cid:3) on a high-traction road-surface
 (coefficient of friction μHF = 1),

(cid:3) without the driver braking,
(cid:3) with an initial speed of 144 km/h.

Initially, as they approach the S-bend, the
conditions for both vehicles, and their reac-
tions, are identical. Then come the first
steering inputs from the drivers (phase 1).

Vehicle without ESP
As can be seen, in the period following the
initial, abrupt steering input the vehicle
without ESP is already threatening to be-
come unstable (Fig. 4 on left, phase 2).
Whereas the steering input has quickly gen-
erated substantial lateral forces at the front
wheels, there is a delay before the rear
wheels start to generate similar forces. The
vehicle reacts with a clockwise movement
around its vertical axis (inward yaw). The
next stage is phase 3 with the second steer-
ing input. The vehicle without ESP fails to
respond to the driver’s attempt to counter-
steer and goes out of control. The yaw veloc-
ity and the side-slip angle rise radically, and
the vehicle breaks into a skid (phase 4).

Vehicle with ESP
On this vehicle ESP brakes the left front
wheel to counter the threat of instability
(Fig. 4 on right, phase 2) that follows the ini-
tial steering input. Within the ESP context
this is referred to as active braking, and it
proceeds without any intervention on the
driver’s part. This action reduces the ten-
dency to yaw toward the inside of the corner
(inward yaw). The yaw velocity is reduced
and the side-slip angle is limited. Following
the countersteer input, first the yaw moment
and then the yaw velocity reverse their direc-
tions (phase 3). In phase 4 a second brief
brake application – this time at the right
front wheel – restores complete stability. 
The vehicle remains on the course defined
by the steering-wheel angle.

the complexity of the steering process and
lowers the demands placed on the driver. 
Yet another asset is that the ESP vehicle stops
in less distance than the vehicle equipped
with ABS alone.

Oversteering and understeering when cornering

Vehicle with ABS but without ESP
Immediately after the initial steering input
both the side-slip angle and the yaw velocity
have increased to the point where driver in-
tervention – in the form of countersteer – has
become imperative (Fig. 6, on
left). This driver action then
generates a side-slip angle in the
opposite direction (technically:
with the opposite operational
sign). This side-slip angle in-
creases rapidly, and the driver
must countersteer for a second
time. Here the driver is able –
but only just – to restabilize the
vehicle and bring it to a safe halt.

9

Vehicle with ESP
Because ESP reduces yaw veloc-
ity and side-slip angle to easily
controllable levels, this vehicle
remains stable at all times. The
driver is not confronted with
unanticipated instability and can
thus continue to devote full at-
tention to keeping the vehicle on
course. ESP substantially reduces

Extended steering and countersteering

A vehicle traversing a series of S-curves (for

a situation similar to that encountered on a

10

Curves for dynamic response parameters for rapid

clearly seen during this kind of dynamic ma-
neuver when the steering wheel has to 
be turned to progressively greater angles to
negotiate each turn.

Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate the handling
 response of two vehicles (one with and 
one without ESP) under these conditions
(cid:3) on a snow-covered road (μHF = 0.45),
(cid:3) without the driver braking, and
(cid:3) at a constant velocity of 72 km/h.

Vehicle without ESP
Engine output will have to be increased con-
tinually in order to maintain a constant road
speed. This, in turn, will generate progressively
greater slip at the driven wheels. A sequence of
steering and countersteering maneuvers with a
40° steering-wheel angle can quickly increase
drive slip to such levels that a vehicle without
ESP becomes unstable. At some point in this
alternating sequence the vehicle suddenly
ceases to respond to steering inputs and breaks
into a slide. While lateral acceleration remains
virtually constant, both side-slip angle and yaw
velocity rise radically.

Vehicle with ESP
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) inter-
venes at an early stage in this sequence of
steering and countersteering maneuvers to
counter the instability that threatens right
from the outset. ESP relies on engine inter-
vention as well as individually controlled
braking of all four wheels to maintain the

Acceleration/deceleration during  cornering
A decreasing-radius curve becomes progres-
sively tighter as one proceeds. If a vehicle
maintains a constant velocity through such 
a curve (as frequently encountered on free-
way/highway exit ramps) the outward, or cen-
trifugal force, will increase at the same time
(Fig. 12). This also applies when the driver 
accelerates too soon while exiting a curve. 
In terms of the physics of vehicle operation, 
it produces the same effects as the situation de-
scribed above (Fig. 13). Excessive braking in
such a curve is yet another potential source of
radial and tangential forces capable of induc-
ing instability during cornering. 

A vehicle’s handling response during
 simultaneous acceleration and cornering 
is determined by testing on the skid pad
(semi-steady-state circulation). In this test the
driver gradually accelerates 
(cid:3) on a high-traction surface (μHF = 1.0) and
(cid:3) attempts to stay on a skid pad with a

100 meter radius while circulating at pro-
gressively faster rates; this continues until
the vehicle reaches its cornering limits.

Vehicle without ESP
During testing on the skid pad at approxi-
mately 95 km/h the vehicle responds to the im-
pending approach of its physical operating
limits by starting to understeer. The demand

for steering input starts to rise rapidly, while at
the same time the side-slip angle increases dra-
matically. This is the upper limit at which the
driver can still manage to keep the car  inside
the skid pad. A vehicle without ESP  enters its
unstable range at roughly 98 km/h. The rear
end breaks away and the driver must counter-
steer and leave the skid pad.

Vehicle with ESP
Up to a speed of roughly 95 km/h, vehicles
with and without ESP display identical re-
sponse patterns. Because this speed coincides
with the vehicle’s stability limit, the ESP refuses
to implement continued driver demand for
further acceleration to beyond this point. ESP
uses engine intervention to limit the drive
torque. Active engine and braking intervention
work against the tendency of the vehicle to un-
dersteer. This results in minor deviations from
the initially projected course, which the driver
can then correct with appropriate steering ac-
tion. At this point, the driver has assumed an
active role as an element within the control
loop. Subsequent fluctuations in steering-
wheel and side-slip angle will now be a func-
tion of the driver’s reactions, as will the final
speed of between 95 and 98 km/h as stipulated
for the test. The  vital factor is that ESP consis-
tently maintains these fluctuations within the
stable range.

Closed-loop control system and controlled variables

Closed-loop control system
and controlled variables

Electronic stability program concept
Application of the ESP closed-loop stability
control in the vehicle’s limit situation as 
defined by the dynamics of vehicle motion 
is intended to prevent the
(cid:3) linear (longitudinal) velocity, the
(cid:3) lateral velocity and the
(cid:3) rotational speed around the vertical axis

(yaw velocity),

exceeding the ultimate control limits. Assum-
ing appropriate operator inputs, driver de-
mand is translated into dynamic vehicular re-
sponse that is adapted to the characteristics of
the road in an optimization process designed
to ensure maximum safety. As shown in Fig.
1, the first step is to determine how the vehi-
cle should respond to driver  demand during
operation in the limit range (ideal response),
and also how it actually does respond (actual
response). Actuators are then applied to mini-
mize the difference between the ideal and 
the actual response (control deviation) by 
indirectly influencing the forces acting at the
tires.

System and control structure
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP)
 embraces capabilities extending far beyond
those of either ABS or ABS and TCS com-
bined. Based on advanced versions of ABS
and ABS/TCS system components, it allows
active braking at all four wheels with a high
level of dynamic sensitivity. Vehicle response
is adopted as an element within the control
loop. The system controls braking, propulsive
and lateral forces so that the actual response
converges with the ideal response under the
given circumstances.

An engine-management system with CAN
interface can vary engine output torque in or-
der to adjust the driven-wheel slip rates. The
advanced ESP system provides highly precise
performance for selective adjustment of the
dynamic longitudinal and lateral forces acting
on each individual wheel.

Level 1 ESP controller
Task
The ESP controller is responsible for
(cid:3) determining the current vehicle status

based on the yaw velocity signal and the
side-slip angle estimated by the “monitor”
and then

(cid:3) achieving maximum possible convergence
between vehicle response in the limit range
and its characteristics in the normal oper-
ating range (ideal response).

The following components register driver de-
mand and the system processes their signals
as the basis for defining ideal response:
(cid:3) engine-management system (e. g. pressure

on accelerator pedal),

(cid:3) primary-pressure sensor (e. g. activation of

(cid:3) steering-wheel sensor (steering-wheel

brakes), or 

 angle).

At this point the specified response is  defined
as driver demand. The coefficient of friction

2

ESP control loop in vehicle

and the vehicle speed are also  included in 
the processing calculations as  supplementary
parameters. The “monitor” estimates these
factors based on signals transmitted by the
sensors for
(cid:3) wheel speed,
(cid:3) lateral acceleration,
(cid:3) braking pressures, and
(cid:3) yaw velocity.

The desired vehicle response is brought about
by generating a yaw moment acting on the
vehicle. In order to generate the desired yaw
moment, the controller intervenes in the 
tire-slip rates to indirectly influence the 
longitudinal and lateral forces. The system 
influences the tire slip by varying the specifi-
cations for slip rate, which must then be 
executed by the subordinated ABS and TCS
controllers.

The intervention process is designed to
maintain the handling characteristics that 
the manufacturer intended the vehicle to 
have and to serve as the basis for ensuring
consistently reliable control.

The ESP controller generates the specified
yaw moment by relaying corresponding 
slip-modulation commands to the selected
wheels.

The subordinate-level ABS and TCS con-
trollers trigger the actuators governing the
brake hydraulic system and the engine-
management system using the data generated
in the ESP controller.

The specifications for side-slip angle and yaw
velocity are determined on the basis of the 
following parameters, which may be either 
directly or indirectly defined by driver input:
(cid:3) steering-wheel angle,
(cid:3) estimated vehicle speed,
(cid:3) coefficient of friction, which is determined
on the basis of the longitudinal acceleration
(estimated parameter) and lateral
 acceleration (measured parameter), and 
(cid:3) accelerator-pedal travel (engine torque) 
or brake-circuit pressure (force on brake
pedal).

These processes also take into account the
special characteristics related to vehicle dy-
namics, as well as unusual situations, such 
as a crowned road or μ-split surface (e.g. high
traction on left of lane with right side slip-
pery).

Method of Operation
The ESP controller governs the two status pa-
rameters “yaw velocity” and “side-slip  angle”
while calculating the yaw moment required to
make the actual and desired-state parameters
converge. As the side-slip angle increases, so
does its significance for the controller.

The control program is based upon data
concerning the maximum potential lateral 
acceleration and other data selected to reflect
the vehicle’s dynamic response patterns.
These are determined for each vehicle in
steady-state skid-pad testing. In subsequent
steady-state vehicle operation, as well as dur-
ing braking and acceleration, this data –
defining how the steering angle and vehicle
speed relate to the yaw velocity – serves as the
basis for defining the desired vehicle  motion.
The required data (nominal yaw  velocity) is
stored in the program in the form of a single-
track model.

The nominal yaw velocity must be limited 
in line with the friction coefficient so as to
keep the vehicle on the predefined physically
feasible track.

For example, if a vehicle breaks into over-

steer while coasting into a right-handed

(cid:2)

Single-track model

Ranges of lateral acceleration

Passenger cars can achieve lateral accelera-
tions up to 10 m/s2. Lateral acceleration in the
small signal range (0...0.5 m/s2) can be caused
by road conditions such as ruts or by cross-
winds. 

The linear range extends from 0.5...4 m/s2.

Typical lateral maneuvers include changing 
lane or load-change reactions when cornering.
The response of the vehicle in these situations
can be described using the linear single-track
model. 

In the transition range (4...6 m/s2) some vehi-

cles still respond linearly while others do not. 

The critical range above 6 m/s2 is only

reached in extreme situations such as situations
that almost result in an accident. In this case
the vehicle response is highly non-linear.

Assumptions with the single-track model

The linear single-track model can be used to
obtain important information about the lateral
behavior of a vehicle. In the single-track model
the lateral properties of an axle and its wheels
are summarized into one effective wheel. In 
the simplest version, the properties taken into
account are modeled using linear equations;
thus the model is referred to as a linear single-
track model.

The most important model assumptions are:
(cid:3) Kinematics and elastokinematics of the axle

are only modeled linearly.

(cid:3) The lateral force buildup of the tire is linear

and the aligning torque is ignored.

(cid:3) The center of gravity is assumed to be at
road level. The only rotational degree of
 freedom of the vehicle is therefore the yaw
motion. Rolling, pitching and lifting (transla-
tional movements in z-axis) are not taken 
into account.

392

Electronic stability program

Closed-loop control system and controlled variables

curve, and the specified yaw velocity is ex-
ceeded (the vehicle evinces a tendency to
 rotate too quickly around its vertical axis),
ESP responds by braking the left front wheel
to generate a defined brake slip which shifts
the yaw moment toward greater counter-
clockwise rotation thus suppressing the
 vehicle’s tendency to break away.

If a vehicle breaks into understeer while
coasting into a right-handed curve, and the
yaw velocity is below the specified yaw rate
(the vehicle evinces a tendency to rotate too
slowly around its vertical axis), ESP responds
by braking the right rear wheel to generate 
a defined brake slip which shifts the yaw
 moment toward greater clockwise rotation
thus suppressing the vehicle’s tendency to
push over the front axle.

ESP controller functions during ABS and 
TCS operation
The entire spectrum of monitored and
 estimated data is relayed to the subordinate
controllers for continuous processing. This
guarantees maximum exploitation of the
traction available between tire and road sur-
face for the basic ABS and TCS functions 
under all operating conditions.

During active ABS operation (with wheels
tending to lock) the ESP controller provides
the subordinate ABS controller with the 
following data:
(cid:3) lateral vehicle velocity,
(cid:3) yaw velocity,
(cid:3) steering-wheel angle, and
(cid:3) wheel speeds as the foundation for
 providing the desired ABS slip.

When TCS is active (wheels threatening to
break into uncontrolled spin when moving
off or during rolling acceleration) the ESP
controller transmits the following offset
 values to the subordinate TCS controller:
(cid:3) change in the specified value for the 

(cid:3) change in the slip tolerance range, and
(cid:3) change in a value to influence the torque

drive-slip,

reduction.

Level 2 ABS controller
Task
The hierarchically subordinated ABS con-
troller goes into operation whenever the
 desired slip rate is exceeded during braking,
and it becomes necessary for ABS to inter-
vene. During both ABS and “active” braking,
the closed-loop control of wheel-slip rates 
as applied for various dynamic-intervention
functions must be as precise as possible. 
The system needs precise data on slip as a
precondition for dialing in the specified slip
rates. It must be pointed out that the system
does not measure the vehicle’s longitudinal
speed directly. Instead, this parameter is de-
rived from the rotation rates of the wheels.

Design and method of operation
By briefly “underbraking” one wheel, the ABS
controller performs an indirect measurement
of vehicle speed. It interrupts the slip control
to lower the current braking torque by a
 defined increment. The torque is then main-
tained at this level for a given period. 
Assuming that the wheel has stabilized and 
is turning freely with no slip at the end of 
this period, it can serve as a  suitable source
for  determining (no-slip) wheel speed.

The calculated velocity at the center of
gravity can be used to determine the effective
(free-rolling) wheel speeds at all four wheels.
These data, in turn, form the foundation for
calculating the actual slip rates at the remain-
ing three – controlled – wheels.

Level 2 engine drag-torque controller
(EDTC)
Task
Following downshifts and when the accelera-
tor is suddenly released, inertia in the engine’s
moving parts always exerts a degree of brak-
ing force at the drive wheels. Once this force
and the corresponding reactive torque rise
beyond a certain level, the tires will lose their
ability to transfer the resulting loads to the
road. Engine drag-torque control intervenes
under these conditions (by “gently” accelerat-
ing the engine).

Electronic stability program

Closed-loop control system and controlled variables

393

Design and method of operation
Factors such as variations in the character of
the road surface can lead to conditions under
which the engine-braking torque is suddenly
too high. The result is a tendency for the
wheels to lock. One available countermeasure
is judicious throttle application. Here, the
ECU transmits signals to trigger the corre-
sponding actuators in the engine-manage-
ment system (with ETC function) for an in-
crease in drive torque. Intervention at the 
engine-management level is employed to reg-
ulate the driven wheel within the prescribed
limits.

Level 2 TCS controller
Task
The hierarchically subordinated TCS con-
troller is triggered in case of excessive slip
during (for example) standing-start and dur-
ing rolling acceleration when it becomes nec-
essary for TCS to intervene. TCS is intended
to prevent the driven wheels from breaking
into a free spin. It functions by limiting en-
gine torque to a level corresponding to the
drive torque that the wheels can transfer to
the road surface.

Intervention at the driven wheels is carried

out by means of brake application or by in-
cluding the engine management system in the
process. In diesel-engine vehicles, the elec-
tronic diesel control system (EDC) reduces
the engine torque by modifying the quantity
of fuel injected. With gasoline-engines, the
engine torque can be reduced by varying the
throttle valve aperture (ETC), modifying the
ignition timing, or suppressing individual 
injection pulses. 

Active braking at non-driven wheels is gov-

erned directly by the ABS controller.  Unlike
with ABS, TCS receives values from the ESP
controller for changing the specified slip and
permissible slip difference of the driven
axle(s). These changes take effect in the form
of an offset applied to the basic values defined
in the TCS.

Design
The specified propshaft speed and wheel-
speed differential data are calculated from 
the specified slip values and speeds for the
“coasting” wheels. The propshaft speed and
wheel-speed differential controlled variables
are derived from the driven wheel speeds.

Method of Operation
The TCS module calculates the desired brak-
ing torque for both driven wheels and the 
desired value for engine torque reduction to
be implemented by the engine-management
system.

Because the propshaft speed is affected 

by inertial forces originating from the
 drivetrain as a whole (engine, transmission,
 driven wheels, and the propshaft itself), a 
relatively large time constant is employed 
to  describe its corresponding leisurely rate 
of dynamic response. In contrast, the time
 constant for the wheel-speed differential is
relatively small, reflecting the fact that the
wheels’ own inertial forces are virtually the
sole determining factor for their dynamic
 response. Another relevant factor is that the
wheel-speed differential – unlike propshaft
speed – is not affected by the engine.

The torques prescribed for the propshaft
and wheel-speed differential are taken as the
basis for defining the actuators’ positioning
forces. The system achieves the specified dif-
ference in braking torque between the left and
right-side driven wheels by transmitting the
appropriate control signals to valves in the
hydraulic modulator.

Propshaft torques are regulated to the
 desired level using symmetrical braking as
well as engine intervention. With a gasoline-
engine, adjustments undertaken through the
throttle valve are relatively slow to take effect
(lag and the engine’s transition response). 
Retarding the ignition timing and, as a
 further option, selective suppression of
 injection pulses are employed for rapid en-
gine-based intervention, while symmetrical
braking can be applied for brief transitional
support of engine torque reduction.

Automatic brake functions

Overview

Automatic brake functions

The possibilities of today’s electronic brake
systems go far beyond the tasks for which
they were originally designed. Originally 
the antilock braking system (ABS) was 
only used to prevent the wheels of a vehicle
from locking up and therefore to ensure the
steerability of the vehicle even during emer-
gency braking. Today, the brake system also
controls the distribution of the braking-
force. The electronic stability program (ESP),
with its ability to build up brake pressure 
independently of the position of the brake
pedal, offers a whole series of possibilities 
for active brake intervention. The ESP is 
intended to assist the driver by applying the
brakes automatically and to therefore pro-
vide the driver with a higher level of comfort
and convenience. Some functions, however,
enhance the vehicle safety since automatic
brake application during an emergency 
results in shorter braking distances. 

Overview

The main function of the electronic brake
system is the Electronic Braking-force 
Distribution (EBD) function which replaces
the mechanical components for braking-force
distribution between the front and rear axles.
This function not only cuts costs, but also
makes the electronic distribution of the 
braking force extremely flexible.

Additional functions are gradually being

integrated into electronic brake systems. 
The following additional functions are
 currently available:
(cid:3) Hydraulic brake assist (HBA):

HBA detects emergency braking situations
and shortens the braking distance by 
building up the brake pressure up to the
wheel-lock limit.

(cid:3) Controlled deceleration for parking brake

(CDP):
CDP brakes the vehicle until it is stationary
when requested by the driver.

(cid:3) Hill hold control (HHC):

(cid:3) Brake disk wiping (BDW):

BDW removes splash water from the brake
disks by briefly applying the brakes. This
brake application is not noticed by the 
driver.

These functions work together with the 
Electronic Stability Program (ESP). Some 
of these functions may also be available 
with the Antilock Braking System (ABS) 
or the Traction Control System (TCS).

Most of the additional functions operate

with the sensor technology of the existing
electronic brake systems. Some functions,
however, require additional sensors.

HHC intervenes in the brake system when
pulling away on a hill and prevents the
 vehicle from rolling backwards.

(cid:3) Hill descent control (HDC):

HDC assists the driver when driving 
downhill on steep terrain by automatically
applying the brakes.

(cid:3) Controlled deceleration for driver assistance

systems (CDD):
CDD brakes the vehicle if required in 
combination with automatic vehicle- 
to-vehicle ranging.

(cid:3) Hydraulic fading compensation (HFC):

HFC intervenes if the maximum possible
vehicle deceleration is not achieved even
though the driver is forcefully pressing the
brake pedal, e. g. due to high brake disk
temperatures.

(cid:3) Hydraulic rear wheel boost (HRB):

HRB also increases the brake pressure in
the rear wheels up to the wheel-lock limit
during ABS brake application.

Electronic braking-force distribution
(EBD)
Requirements
Legal requirements demand that the braking
systems of road vehicles are designed in such
a way that they ensure a deceleration up to of
0.83g 1) and provide stable driving behavior
during all types of maneuvers so that the 
vehicle does not exhibit unstable handling
characteristics (i. e. a tendency to skid). 

Conventional braking-force distribution
On vehicles without ABS, this is achieved by a
fixed braking-force distribution between the
front and rear brakes or by the use of propor-
tioning valves for the rear brakes (Fig. 1). 
Curve 2 shows the pattern for a vehicle
with a fixed braking-force distribution which,
within the range 0...0.83g is below the ideal
braking-force distribution curve (1l) for an
unladen vehicle and fails to utilize the poten-
tial for higher rear-wheel braking forces. With
a fully laden vehicle, (curve 1b), the utiliza-
tion of potential is even lower. Curve 3 illus-
trates the characteristic obtained by using a
proportioning valve, whereby a significant
gain in rear-wheel braking force is obtained
in an unladen vehicle. With the vehicle fully
laden, however, the im-
provement is relatively
small.

This latter character-

istic can be improved
by the use of load-de-
pendent or decelera-
tion-dependent propor-
tioning valves, but at
the cost of complex me-
chanics and hydraulics.

Electronic distribution
Electronic Braking-force Distribution (EBD)
allows the distribution between front and 
rear brakes to be adjusted according to condi-
tions. Handling response is continuously
monitored and a greater proportion of the
overall braking force can be applied to the
rear brakes when conditions allow because
the proportioning valve is dispensed with or
else larger dimensioned rear wheel brakes are
fitted. This releases additional braking poten-
tial for the front wheels which can be utilized
on vehicles with a high forward weight bias 
in particular. 

Design
The vehicle is designed in such a way that
without a proportioning valve, the fixed 
braking-force distribution curve intersects
the ideal braking-force distribution curve
(curve 1) at a point P (Fig. 2) at a lower 
overall braking force, e.g. 0.5g. The use of the
existing ABS system’s hydraulics, sensors and
electronics, but with modified valves and
software, allows the braking force at the rear
wheels to be reduced at higher overall braking
levels.

Method of operation 
The ECU continuously calculates the slip 
difference between the front and rear wheels
in all driving situations. If the ratio of front 
to rear wheel slip exceeds a defined stable-
handling threshold when braking, the ABS
pressure inlet valve for the appropriate rear
wheel is closed. This prevents further increase
of brake pressure at that wheel.

If the driver then further increases the force

applied to the brake pedal, and therefore the
brake pressure, the degree of slip at the front
wheels also increases. The difference between
front and rear wheel slip  diminishes and the
pressure inlet valve is opened again so that the
pressure at the rear wheel rises once more. This
process may then be repeated a number of
times depending on the brake pedal force and
the maneuver being performed. The electronic
braking-force distribution curve then takes on
a staircase appearance (curve 3) which approx-
imates to the ideal braking-force distribution
curve.

For the Electronic Braking-force Distribution
(EBD) function, only the rear-brake valves of

2

the ABS system are activated, the return
pump motor in the hydraulic modulator unit
remains de-energized.  

Advantages

all payload conditions, in all cornering 
situations, on uphill or downhill gradients,

Additional functions

Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA)
The main task of the hydraulic brake assist 
is to detect an emergency braking situation
and as a result to automatically increase the
vehicle deceleration. The vehicle deceleration
is only limited by the intervention of ABS
control and is therefore close to the optimum
level possible within physical limits. A normal
driver is therefore able to achieve the short
braking distances that could previously only
be achieved by specially trained drivers. If the
driver reduces the desired level of braking,
the vehicle deceleration is reduced in accor-
dance with the force applied to the brake
pedal. The driver can therefore precisely
modulate the vehicle deceleration when the
emergency braking situation has passed.
The driver’s desired level of braking is
 determined by the force or pressure he/she
applies to the brake pedal. The pedal pressure
is derived from the measured master cylinder
pressure taking into account the current 
hydraulic control.

The driver can intervene in the brake applica-
tion at any time and can therefore directly in-
fluence the vehicle’s response. The HBA can
only increase the brake pressure. The primary
pressure applied by the driver is therefore the
minimum pressure used by the system. If a
system error occurs, the HBA is shutoff and
the driver is informed that an error has 
occurred.

Controlled Deceleration for Parking
Brake CDP
The Electromechanical Parking Brake (EPB)
is an automated parking brake system. It
 replaces the conventional hand brake lever 
or foot-operated parking brake lever with 
an electric motor. The disadvantage of the
parking brake is that it only affects the rear
axle and its braking force is limited in the
event of emergency braking. The CDP 
function increases braking deceleration and
simultaneously enables an ESP system con-
troller to be used to ensure vehicle stability.  

The CDP function is an additional function
to actively increase the brake pressure in vehi-
cles fitted with an hydraulic braking system
and ESP system. On the driver’s request, the
CDP function automatically decelerates the
vehicle until it is stationary. Once the  vehicle
has come to a standstill, the ESP  hydraulics
system briefly adopts all static parking brake
processes.

Hill Hold Control HHC
The Hill Hold Control (HHC) starting-off
assistant is a comfort and convenience func-
tion that prevents the vehicle from rolling
backwards when pulling away on hills and 
inclines. The gradient of the hill or slope 
is measured by a tilt sensor (longitudinal
 acceleration sensor). To operate, the starting-
off assistant requires the brake pressure 
available when the vehicle is stationary that
was built up when the driver pressed the foot
brake.

The brake pressure specified by the driver
when stopping the vehicle is maintained in
the brake system when the system detects that
the vehicle is stationary, even if the driver re-
leases the brake pedal. The brake pressure is
reduced after a pressure holding time of up to
a maximum of two seconds. During this time
the driver can press the accelerator pedal and
pull away. The brake pressure is reduced
when the system detects the driver’s intention
to pull away.

The system detects that the driver wishes to
pull away if the engine torque is sufficient for
the vehicle to move in the desired direction.
This state can be triggered by the driver press-
ing the accelerator pedal and/or clutch as well

Activation

  (if front of vehicle is facing uphill)
• Engage reverse gear
  (if rear of vehicle is facing uphill)

as by the transmission outputting an engine
torque (e. g. automatic/continuously variable
transmission). 

The brake pressure is not maintained in the
brake system if there is already sufficient en-
gine torque when the vehicle is stationary
(e.g. due to the accelerative force of the
 automatic transmission).

If the driver presses the accelerator pedal

during the vehicle-specific holding time, 
the holding time is extended until sufficient
engine torque is available for the vehicle to
pull away.

If the driver does not press the accelerator
or the brake pedal, the function is deactivated
at the latest after two seconds. The  vehicle
then starts rolling.

The HHC function is also designed as an
 additional function for the ESP system and 
it uses parts of this system. The function is
activated automatically.

Hill Descent Control HDC
The Hill Descent Control (HDC) is a comfort
and convenience function that assists the 
driver when driving down hill (on gradients
of up to 50%) by automatically applying the
brakes. Once this function is activated a 
predetermined, low desired-speed is intro-
duced and regulated without any necessary
intervention from the driver.

The driver must activate and deactivate the

HDC function by pressing the HDC push-
button.

If required the driver can vary the predeter-
mined speed by pressing the brake and accel-
erator pedal or using the control buttons of a
speed control system.

If the brake slip of the wheels is too high dur-
ing HDC control, the ABS system intervenes
automatically. If the wheels are on different
road surfaces, the braking torque of the slip-
ping wheels is automatically distributed to
the wheels with a higher coefficient of fric-
tion.

If engine braking torque is available it is
used automatically. Compared to the exclu-
sive use of engine braking torque in order to
maintain the vehicle speed, the HDC func-
tion has the advantages that if the wheels
leave the surface of the road (loss of engine
braking torque) the vehicle speed is main-
tained and sudden acceleration phases do not
occur.

Another advantage of the HDC function is
the variable distribution of the braking force
which is coupled to the automatic driving di-
rection recognition function. When reversing
the rear axle is braked more forcefully to 
ensure optimum steerability even if the front
axle is relieved of the load.

The level ground detection function inte-
grated in the HDC only permits brake appli-
cation by the HDC when driving downhill. 
If the vehicle is on the flat or driving uphill,
the HDC switches to a standby mode and 
is reactivated automatically as soon as the 
system detects that the vehicle is traveling
downhill.

To prevent the driver misusing this func-

tion, the HDC also switches to its standby
mode if the accelerator pedal is pressed
passed a certain threshold or if the vehicle 
exceeds a maximum control speed. The 
HDC function is deactivated if the vehicle 
accelerates beyond a preset cutoff-speed.

The status of the HDC function is indicated
by the HDC indicator lamp. The brake lamp
indicates when the HDC function applies the
brakes.

Controlled Deceleration for Driver
 Assistance Systems CDD
The basic CDD function is an additional
function for active brake application with the
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), i. e. for auto-
matic vehicle-to-vehicle ranging. The brakes
are applied automatically without the driver
pressing the brake pedal as soon as the dis-
tance to the vehicle in front falls below a pre-
determined distance. CDD is based on a hy-
draulic braking system and an ESP system.

The CDD function receives a request to
 decelerate the vehicle by a desired amount
(input). CDD then sends the actual amount
of deceleration (output) which is achieved 
by controlling the pressure using hydraulics.
The requested amount of deceleration is
specified by the cruise control system which 
is connected upstream.

Hydraulic Fading Compensation HFC
The Hydraulic Fading Compensation (HFC)
function offers the driver additional brake
servo assistance. The function is activated if
the maximum possible vehicle deceleration 
is not achieved even if the driver forcefully
presses the brake pedal to the point that
would normally cause the lockup pressure to
be reached (primary pressure over approx. 
80 bar). This is the case, for example at high
brake disk temperatures or if the brake pads
have a considerably reduced coefficient of
friction. 

When the HFC is activated, the wheel 
pressures are increased until all wheels have
reached the lockup pressure level and ABS
control is initiated. The brake application 
is therefore at the physical optimum. The
pressure in the wheel-brake cylinders can
then exceed the pressure in the master 
cylinder, also during ABS control.

If the driver reduces the desired level of brak-

ing to a value below a particular threshold
value, the vehicle deceleration is reduced in ac-
cordance with the force applied to the brake
pedal. The driver can therefore precisely modu-
late the vehicle deceleration when the braking
situation has passed. The HFC cuts off if the
primary pressure or vehicle speed falls below
the respective cutoff threshold.

Additional functions

Hydraulic Rear Wheel Boost HRB
The Hydraulic Rear wheel Boost (HRB) pro-
vides the driver with additional brake servo
assistance for the rear wheels if the front
wheels are controlled by the ABS system. 
This function was introduced because many
drivers do not increase the pedal force at 
the start of ABS control even though the 
situation would require this. When the HRB
function is active, the wheel pressures are
 increased at the rear wheels until they also
reach the lockup pressure and ABS control is
initiated. The brake application is therefore 
at the physical optimum. The pressure in 
the rear axle wheel-brake cylinders can then
exceed the pressure in the master cylinder,
also during ABS control. 

The HRB cuts off when the wheels at the
front axle are no longer under ABS control or
when the primary pressure falls below the
cutoff threshold.

Brake Disk Wiping BDW
The Brake Disk Wiping (BDW) function de-
tects rain or a wet road by evaluating wind-
shield wiper or rain sensor signals and then
actively increases the brake pressure in the
service brake. The brake pressure buildup is
used to remove splash water from the disk
brake to ensure minimum brake response
times when driving in wet conditions. The
pressure level when dry-braking is adjusted 
so that the vehicle deceleration cannot be
perceived by the driver.

Dry-braking is repeated at a defined inter-

val for as long as the system detects rain or 
a wet road. If required just the disks at the
front axle can be wiped.

The BDW function interrupts the wiping
procedure as soon as the driver applies the
brakes.

Directional stability

403

(cid:2)

Directional stability

Satisfactory handling is defined according to
whether a vehicle maintains a path that accu-
rately reflects the steering angle while at the
same time remaining stable. To meet this sta-
bility criterion, the vehicle must remain consis-
tently secure and sure-footed, without “plow-
ing” or breaking away.

Dynamic lateral response is a critical factor
in the overall equation. The response pattern
is defined based on the vehicle’s lateral mo-
tion (characterized by the side-slip angle) and
its tendency to rotate around its vertical axis
(yaw velocity) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 2 illustrates the dynamic lateral response
of a vehicle being driven with a fixed steering
angle (skid-pad circulation). Position 1 repre-
sents the instant when steering input is ap-
plied. Curve 2 is the vehicle’s subsequent
course on a high-grip road surface; this track
is an accurate reflection of the steering angle.
This is the case when the coefficient of friction
is sufficient to transfer the lateral acceleration
forces to the road surface. If the coefficient of
friction is lower e.g. due to a slippery road sur-

1

Vehicle travel directions

face, the side-slip angle becomes excessive
(curve 3). Although with a controlled yaw ve-
locity the vehicle will rotate just as far around
its vertical axis as in curve 2, the larger side-
slip angle is now a potential source of instabil-
ity. For this reason the electronic stability pro-
gram controls the yaw velocity and limits the
side-slip angle (cid:2) (curve 4).

Hydraulic modulator

Development history

Hydraulic modulator

The hydraulic modulator forms the hy-
draulic connection between the master cylin-
der and the wheel-brake cylinders and is
therefore the central component of elec-
tronic brake systems. It converts the control
commands of the electronic control unit and
uses solenoid valves to control the  pressures
in the wheel brakes. 

A distinction is made between systems that
modulate the brake pressure applied by the
driver (Antilock Braking System, (ABS)) and
systems that can build-up pressure automati-
cally (Traction Control System (TCS) and
Electronic Stability Program (ESP)). 
All systems are only available as dual-circuit
versions for legal reasons.

Development history

The transition from 3/3 to 2/2 solenoid valve
was a milestone in the development of ABS.
With 3/3 valves, which were used in genera-
tion 2, the control functions for building up,
maintaining and reducing pressure could be
carried out using just one valve. The valves
had three hydraulic connections to carry out
these functions. The disadvantages of this
valve design were extremely expensive electri-
cal control and great mechanical complexity.
Control with the 2/2 valves of the current
generations offers a less expensive solution.
The following section describes how these
valves work.

Generation 8, which was introduced onto

the market in 2001, is designed as a fully
modular system. The hydraulic system can
therefore be tailored to meet the require-
ments of the respective vehicle manufacturer
such as with regard to value added functions,
comfort and convenience, vehicle segment
(up to lightweight commercial vehicles), etc.
Generation 8 is immersion-proof which
means that the hydraulic modulator can
withstand brief immersion in water.

greater slip determines the controllable pres-
sure of the axle.

With a 4-channel ABS system (for dual 
or X-braking-force distribution), one inlet
and one outlet valve is used for each wheel 
resulting in a total of eight valves. This system
allows each wheel to be controlled individu-
ally.

Moreover, the system features one pump ele-
ment (return pump) and one low-pressure
reservoir for each brake circuit. Both pump 
elements are operated by a shared DC motor.

Mechanical system
A hydraulic modulator for ABS/TCS/ESP
consists of an aluminum block into which the
hydraulic layout is drilled (Fig. 2). This block
also houses the necessary hydraulic function
elements (Fig. 1) presented below. 

ABS hydraulic modulator
With a 3-channel ABS system, this block fea-
tures one inlet valve and one outlet valve for
each front wheel and one inlet valve and one
outlet valve for the rear axle – a total of six
valves. This system can only be used in vehi-
cles featuring a dual brake-circuit configura-
tion. The two wheels at the rear axle are not
controlled individually, rather both wheels
are controlled according to the select-low
principle. This means that the wheel with the

Hydraulic modulator

Design

TCS hydraulic modulator
Unlike an ABS unit, a TCS system with 
II-brake-circuit configuration also has a
switchover valve and an inlet valve at the 
rear axle (driven wheels) resulting in a total 
of 10 valves.

In TCS systems with X-brake-circuit con-

figuration an additional switchover valve 
and inlet valve are required for each circuit 
(a total of 12 valves).

ESP hydraulic modulator
ESP systems require 12 valves irrespective of
the brake-circuit configuration (Fig. 3). In
these systems, the two inlet valves, as used in
the TCS hydraulic modulator, are replaced 
by two high-pressure switching valves. The
difference between the two types of valves is
that the high-pressure switching valve can
switch against higher differential pressures 
(> 0.1 MPa). With ESP it may be necessary to
increase the brake pressure specified by the

driver in order to stabilize the vehicle. During
such a maneuver (partially-active maneuver),
the suction path of the pump must be opened
despite the high primary pressure.

An integrated pressure sensor is used exclu-

sively in ESP systems. The sensor detects the
brake pressure in the master cylinder i.e. the
driver command. This is also required for a
partially-active ESP control maneuver since it
is important to know the primary pressure
applied by the driver pressing the brake pedal.

Since TCS/ESP systems are required to
 generate pressure automatically, the return
pump is replaced by a self-priming pump 
in both these systems. An additional non-
 return valve with a specific closing pressure is
required to prevent the pump from drawing
unwanted media from the wheels.

ABS systems to be more than halved since
the first-generation ABS2 in 1978. As a result,
modern systems can now be accommodated
even in vehicles with the tightest space re-

the cost of ABS systems to the extent that it
has now become standard equipment on all
types of vehicle.

Hydraulic modulator

Pressure modulation

Pressure modulation

Modulation with ABS control
The pressure of an ABS/TCS/ESP system 
is modulated using solenoid valves. The out-
let valves and the inlet and high-pressure
switching valves (for TCS and ESP systems)
are switching valves that are closed at zero
current and can adopt two positions – closed
or open. 

In contrast, the inlet valves and switchover
valves are both open at zero current and are
used as control valves for the first time in
generation 8. This is advantageous not only
for instantaneous braking power and braking
comfort but also for noise emissions. Pres-
sures of up to 200 bar can be modulated 
using the standard valve set. Special systems
for even higher pressures and also for greater
throughput, usually required in the commer-
cial vehicle sector, can be designed based 
on further developments of the generation 
8 modular system. 

All valves are controlled using coils which
are controlled via the add-on control unit. 

Pressure modulation with ABS hydraulic
modulator
In the event of ABS brake application, the
driver first generates the brake pressure at the
wheel by pressing the brake pedal. This can be
done without switching the valves since the
inlet valve is open at zero current and the
outlet valve is closed at zero current (Fig. 1a).
The pressure maintenance state is generated

when the inlet valve is closed (Fig. 1b).

If a wheel locks up, the pressure from this

wheel is released by opening the relevant 
outlet valve (Fig. 1c). The brake fluid can also
escape from the wheel-brake cylinder to the
relevant low-pressure reservoir. 
This chamber performs the role of a buffer. 
It can receive the brake fluid quickly and
 efficiently. The return pump in the circuit,
which is driven by a shared motor via an
 eccentric element, reduces the pressure speci-
fied by the driver. The motor is actuated
based on demand i.e. the motor is actuated
according to the rotational speed. The ABS

system can of course control several wheels if
they lock up simultaneously.

switching valve that is closed at zero current.
These two valves are required for active/par-
tially-active brake intervention (Fig. 2). 

Pressure generation with ESP
The pressure generation chain consists of two
self-priming pumps and a motor. Plunger
pumps are used, as for ABS, but these pumps
can generate pressure without requiring the
primary pressure applied when the driver
presses the brake pedal. These pumps are 
driven by a DC motor based on demand. The
motor drives an eccentric bearing located on
the shaft of the motor.

TCS/ESP pumps can build up pressure inde-
pendently of the driver or increase the brak-
ing pressure already generated by the driver.
These systems are therefore able to initiate
brake application. To do this, the switchover
valve is closed and the inlet valve or high-
pressure switching valve is opened. Fluid 
can then be drawn from the brake fluid 
reservoir via the master cylinder and pressure
can be built up in the wheel-brake cylinders
(Fig. 2c). This is required not only for
TCS/ESP functions, but also for many addi-
tional convenience functions (value added
functions such as the brake assist (HBA)).

Demand-based control of the pump motor
reduces noise emission during pressure 
generation and regulation. The pumps can 
be equipped with damping elements to 
satisfy vehicle manufacturer’s strict low noise
emission requirements. 

Pressure modulation with ESP hydraulic
modulators
Pressure is modulated with ESP control  using
ESP hydraulics in the same way as described
for ABS. Unlike with ABS, however, the
wheel-brake cylinder and master cylinder are
also connected via a switchover valve that is
open at zero current and a high-pressure

Hydraulic modulator

Pressure modulation

Fully-active control
If the ESP controller detects an unstable
 vehicle state, the switchover valves are 
closed. This prevents the pumps from being
hydraulically short-circuited via the
switchover/high-pressure switching valve
which would prevent pressure generation.
The high-pressure switching valves are
 simultaneously opened. The self-priming
pump now pumps brake fluid to the relevant
wheel or wheels in order to build up pressure.
If pressure generation is only required in 
one wheel, (for yaw rate compensation), the
inlet valves of the other wheels are closed. 
To reduce the pressure, the outlet valves are
opened and the high-pressure switching
valves and switchover valves return to their
original position. The brake fluid flows from
the wheels to the reservoirs. The pumps then
empty the reservoirs. 

With ESP, there are basically three different
applications: 
(cid:3) Passive – as previously described for ABS

control.

(cid:3) Partially-active – when the pressure speci-
fied by the driver is insufficient to stabilize
the vehicle.

(cid:3) Fully-active – when pressure is generated to
stabilize the vehicle without the driver
pressing the brake pedal.

Both pressure generation cases above, in ad-
dition to ESP control, are used for a whole se-
ries of additional functions such as adaptive
cruise control and the brake assist.

Partially-active control
For partially-active control, the high-pressure
switching valve must be able to open the suc-
tion path of the pump against high pressures.
This is required since the driver has already
generated a high pressure, but this pressure is
insufficient to stabilize the vehicle.

The high-pressure switching valve is

 designed with two stages so that the valve can
open against the high pressure. The first stage
of the valve is opened via the magnetic force
of the energized coil; the second stage via the
hydraulic area difference.

If the ESP controller detects an unstable 
vehicle state, the switchover valves (open at
zero current) are closed and the high-pres-
sure switching valve (closed at zero current) 
is opened. The two pumps then generate
 additional pressure in order to stabilize the
vehicle.

Once the vehicle is stabilized, the outlet
valve is opened and the excess pressure in the
controlled wheel escapes to the reservoir. As
soon as the driver releases the brake pedal, the
fluid is pumped from the reservoir back to
the brake fluid reservoir.

Development of hydraulic modulators

Control of hydraulic modulators
An electronic control unit processes the infor-
mation received from the sensors and gener-
ates the control signals for the hydraulic mod-
ulator. The hydraulic modulator incorporates 
a series of solenoid valves that can open or
close the hydraulic circuits between the mas-
ter cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinders.

Hydraulic modulators with 3/3 solenoid valves
In 1978 version ABS2S was the first antilock
braking system to go into series production. 
In this ABS system the electronic control unit
switches the 3/3 solenoid valves of the hy-
draulic modulator to three different valve posi-
tions. There is a solenoid valve for each wheel-
brake cylinder (Fig. 1a).
– The first (zero-current) position connects
the master cylinder and the wheel-brake
cylinder; the wheel brake pressure can rise.

– The second position (excitation at half the
maximum current) separates the wheel
brake from the master cylinder and return
line so that the wheel brake pressure
 remains constant.

– The third position (excitation at the maxi-

mum current) separates the master cylinder
and simultaneously connects the wheel
brake and return line so that the wheel
brake pressure decreases. 

By applying these settings in the appropriate
sequences, the brake pressure can thus be

1

Comparison of ABS systems

 increased and reduced either continuously or
incrementally (and therefore gradually).

Hydraulic modulators with 2/2 solenoid valves
While version ABS2S operates with 3/3 sole-
noid valves, the successor systems ABS5 and
ABS8 feature 2/2 solenoid valves with two hy-
draulic connections and two valve positions.
The inlet valve between the master cylinder and
the wheel-brake cylinder controls pressure
build-up, while the outlet valve between the
wheel-brake cylinder and the return pump con-
trols pressure release. There is a solenoid valve
pair for each wheel-brake cylinder (Fig. 1b).
– In the “pressure build-up” position, the inlet
valve connects the master cylinder to the
wheel-brake cylinder so that the brake pres-
sure built up in the master cylinder can be
applied to the wheel-brake cylinder when
the brakes are applied.

– In the “pressure maintenance” position, the
inlet valve blocks the connection between
the master cylinder and wheel-brake cylin-
der during rapid wheel deceleration (risk 
of locking up) and thus prevents the brake
pressure from rising any higher. The outlet
valve is also closed.

– If the wheel deceleration continues to in-

crease, the inlet valve continues to block in
the “decrease pressure” position. In addition
the return pump pumps out the brake fluid
via the open outlet valve so that the brake
pressure in the wheel-brake cylinder drops.

Sensotronic brake control

Purpose and function

Sensotronic brake control (SBC)

Sensotronic brake control (SBC) is an
 electrohydraulic brake system that com-
bines the functions of a brake servo unit
and the ABS (antilock braking system)
equipment, including ESP (electronic
 stability program). The mechanical opera-
tion of the brake pedal is redundantly mea-
sured by the actuator unit and transmitted
to the control unit. There, control com-
mands are calculated according to specific
algorithms and passed to the hydraulic
modulator where they are converted into
pressure modulating operations for the
brakes. If the electronics fail, a hydraulic
fallback system is automatically available.

Purpose and function

By utilizing its “brake-by-wire” capabilities,
SBC can control the hydraulic pressure in
the wheel brake cylinders independently of
driver input. As a result, functions beyond
those performed by ABS (antilock braking
system), TCS (traction control system) and
ESP (electronic stability program) can be
implemented. One example is the conve-
nient method of brake application for ACC
(adaptive cruise control).

1

SBC components in the car

Basic functions
As with a conventional braking system,
 sensotronic brake control must be capable of 
(cid:3) reducing the speed of the vehicle, 
(cid:3) bringing the vehicle to a halt, and
(cid:3) keeping the vehicle stationary when it is

stopped.

As an active braking system, it also performs
the tasks of 
(cid:3) operating the brakes, 
(cid:3) amplifying the brake force, and 
(cid:3) modulating the brake force. 

SBC is an electronic control system with
 hydraulic actuators. Braking force distribu-
tion takes place electronically to each wheel
in response to driving conditions. A vacuum
source for the brake servo function is no
longer required. The self-diagnosis capabil-
ity enables an early warning function for
 detection of possible system faults.

SBC uses hydraulic standard wheel

brakes. Because of the fully electronic pres-
sure control, SBC can be easily networked
with vehicle handling systems. It thus meets
all the demands made of future braking
 systems.

Sensotronic brake control

Purpose and function

413

By using a high-pressure accumulator, SBC
is capable of extremely rapid dynamic pres-
sure increases and thus offers the potential
for achieving short braking distances and
excellent vehicle handling stability. Brake
pressure modulation and active braking are
silent and produce no brake pedal feedback.
Consequently, SBC also satisfies demands
for greater levels of comfort.

Braking characteristics can be adapted to
the driving conditions (e.g. sharper response
at high speeds or with more dynamic dri-
ving styles). “Duller” pedal characteristics
 allow the reduction of the braking effect,
which is necessitated by physics, to be
 signaled to the driver before fading due
to overheating occurs.

Additional SBC functions
The auxiliary functions provided by SBC
make a significant extra contribution to
safety and convenience.

Hill hold control
After hill hold control is activated by a sig-
nificant increase in brake pressure while the
 vehicle is stationary, the vehicle remains
braked without the need to keep the pedal
down. The hill hold control is automatically
released as soon as the driver has built up
sufficient engine torque by depressing the
accelerator. This allows the driver to start the
car on a hill, for example, without activating
the parking brake system. Likewise, in other
situations in which the vehicle would roll
out of position if not braked, the driver does
not need to keep his or her foot on the brake
at all times once hill hold control has been
 activated.

Enhanced brake assist function
If the driver abruptly releases the accelerator,
an automatically regulated brake pressure
build-up takes place that gently applies the
brake pads. If panic braking follows, this al-
lows the brake to “grab” more quickly and
thus allows a shorter total braking distance. 
If the system detects panic braking, the
brake pressure is briefly increased until the

optimum friction value is fully utilized. This
results in a significant reduction of total
braking distance for hesitant drivers. The
highly dynamic braking force build-up of
SBC exceeds that of conventional systems in
this regard.

Soft stop assist
SBC provides comfortable braking that stops
the car with no jerking by automatically
 reducing the pressure just before the car
comes to a complete stop. If more decelera-
tion is desired, this function is not activated
and SBC minimizes the braking distance. 

Traffic jam assist
When traffic jam assist is activated, SBC
builds up a higher drag torque, which means
that the driver does not have to constantly
alternate between the accelerator and brake.
The vehicle is automatically braked and, if
necessary, brought to a complete stop and
kept at a complete stop. This function can be
activated at speeds of 50 - 60 km/h.

Brake wiping
“Brake wiping” is an operation whereby the
film of water is regularly removed from the
brake disks in wet weather. It results in
shorter stopping distances in wet conditions.
You can take the information for activating
this function from the windshield wiper
 signal, for example.

Sensotronic brake control

Design, method of operation

Design

The sensotronic brake control system
 consists of the following components:
(cid:3) Actuator unit (Fig. 1, Item 6)
(cid:3) Vehicle dynamics sensors (1, 4 and 7)
(cid:3) Discrete (separate) ECU (3)
(cid:3) Hydraulic modulator with add-on

ECU (5).

Those components are interconnected by
electrical control leads and hydraulic pipes.
Fig. 1 shows where they are fitted in a car. 

Actuator unit
The actuator unit consists of: 
(cid:3) Master cylinder with expansion tank,
(cid:3) Pedal travel simulator and
(cid:3) Pedal travel sensor.

Pedal travel simulation
The pedal travel simulator makes it possible
to realize a suitable force-distance curve and
an appropriate damping of the brake pedal.
In that way, the driver obtains the same
“brake feel” with the sensotronic brake
 control system as with a very well designed
conventional braking system.

Sensors of the SBC systems
The SBC sensors consist of the vehicle
 dynamics sensors familiar from ESP and
the actual SBC sensors.

Vehicle dynamics sensors
The ESP sensors consist of four wheel speed
sensors, the yaw rate sensor, a steering angle
sensor and, where applicable, a lateral accel-
eration sensor. These sensors provide the
ECU with data relating to the speed and
movement status of the wheels and driving
states such as cornering. Control functions
such as ABS, TCS and ESP are executed in
the familiar manner.

If the vehicle is fitted with ACC (adaptive
cruise control), a radar system measures the
distance to the vehicle in front. From these
data, the SBC control unit calculates the

brake pressure to be applied, which is built
up without pedal feedback.

SBC sensors
Four pressure sensors measure the pressure
individually for each wheel circuit (Fig. 3).
A pressure sensor measures the storage pres-
sure of the high-pressure accumulator. The
driver’s braking request is calculated by the
pedal travel sensor attached to the  actuator
unit and a pressure sensor that  detects the
brake pressure applied by the  driver. 

The pedal travel sensor consists of two

 redundant, independent angle sensors.
 Together with the pressure sensor for the
 driver’s brake pressure, they allow a threefold
detection of the driver’s request, and the sys-
tem can continue to work without errors
even if one of these systems fails.

Method of operation

Normal operation
Fig. 3 illustrates the components of SBC in
the form of a block diagram. An electric 
motor drives a hydraulic pump. This charges
a high-pressure accumulator to a pressure
between approx. 90 and 130 bar, which is
monitored by the accumulator pressure sen-
sor. The four independent wheel pressure
modulators are supplied by this accumulator
and adjust the required pressure individually
for each wheel. The pressure modulators
themselves each consist of two valves with
proportional control characteristics and a
pressure sensor. 

In normal operation, the isolating valves

interrupt the connection to the actuator.
The system is in “brake-by-wire” mode. It
electronically detects the driver’s braking re-
quest and transmits it “by wire” to the wheel
pressure modulators. The interaction of the
engine, valves and pressure sensors is con-
trolled by the electronics, which are installed
in the add-on ECU in hybrid technology.
They have two microcontrollers that moni-
tor each other. The essential feature of these
electronics is their extensive self-diagnosis,

Sensotronic brake control

415

which monitors the plausibility of every sys-
tem state at all times. In this way, the driver
can be notified of any failures before critical
states occur. If components fail, the system
automatically provides the optimal remain-
ing partial function to the driver. An exten-
sive fault memory allows prompt diagnostics
and repair in the event of a fault.

An intelligent interface with CAN bus es-
tablishes the connection to the discrete ECU.
The following functions are integrated there:
(cid:3) ESP (electronic stability program), 
(cid:3) TCS (traction control system),
(cid:3) ABS (antilock braking system),
(cid:3) Driver brake request calculation and
(cid:3) SBC auxiliary functions (assist functions).

Braking in the event of system failure
For safety reasons, the SBC system is de-
signed so that in the event of any serious 
errors (such as failure of the power supply),
the system is switched to a state in which the
vehicle can be braked even without active
brake force support. When de-energized, the
isolating valves establish a direct connection
to the actuator (Fig. 3) and thus allow a direct
hydraulic connection from the actuator unit
to the wheel brake cylinders. 

To maintain optimum function even if
the system fails, the plunger pistons in the 
illustration serve as a medium separator be-
tween the active circuit of the SBC and the
conventional front axle brake circuit. These
prevent any gas that might escape from the
high-pressure accumulator from reaching
the brake circuit of the front wheels, which
would diminish the instantaneous braking
power in the event of a system failure.

Overview of common-rail systems

The demands placed on diesel-engine 
fuel-injection systems are continuously
 increasing. Higher pressures, faster switching
times, and a variable rate-of-discharge curve
modified to the engine operating state have
made the diesel engine economical, clean,
and powerful. As a result, diesel engines have
even entered the realm of  luxury-
performance sedans.

One of the advanced fuel-injection systems is
the common-rail (CR) fuel-injection system.
The main advantage of the common-rail sys-
tem is its ability to vary injection pressure
and timing over a broad scale. 
This was achieved by separating pressure gen-
eration (in the high-pressure pump) from the
fuel-injection system (injectors). The rail here
acts as a pressure accumulator.

Areas of application

The common-rail fuel-injection system 
for engines with diesel direct injection  
(Direct Injection, DI) is used in the following
vehicles:
(cid:3) Passenger cars ranging from high-economy
3-cylinder engines with displacements of
800 cc, power outputs of 30 kW (41 HP),
torques of 100 Nm, and a fuel consump-
tion of 3.5 l/100 km through to 8-cylinder
engines in luxury-performance sedans 
with displacements of approx. 4 l, power
outputs of 180 kW (245 HP), and torques
of 560 Nm.

(cid:3) Light-duty trucks with engines producing

up to 30 kW/cylinder, and

(cid:3) Heavy-duty trucks, railway locomotives, and
ships with engines producing up to approx.
200 kW/cylinder

Overview of common-rail systems

Areas of application, design

417

The common-rail system is a highly flexible
system for adapting fuel injection to the 
engine. This is achieved by:
(cid:3) High injection pressure up to approx. 
1,600 bar, in future up to 1,800 bar.

(cid:3) Injection pressure adapted to the operating

status (200...1,800 bar).
(cid:3) Variable start of injection.
(cid:3) Possibility of several pre-injection events
and secondary injection events (even
highly retarded secondary injection
events).

In this way, the common-rail system helps 
to raise specific power output, lower fuel con-
sumption, reduce noise emission, and
 decrease pollutant emission in diesel engines.
Today common rail has become the most

commonly used fuel-injection system for
modern, high-rev passenger-car direct-
 injection engines.

Design

The common-rail system consists of the
 following main component groups 
(Figs. 1 and 2):
(cid:3) The low-pressure stage, comprising the fuel-

supply system components.

(cid:3) The high-pressure system, comprising com-
ponents such as the high-pressure pump,
fuel rail, injectors, and high-pressure fuel
lines.

(cid:3) The electronic diesel control (EDC), consist-
ing of system modules, such as sensors, the
electronic control unit, and actuators.

The key components of the common-rail 
system are the injectors. They are fitted 
with a rapid-action valve (solenoid valve or 
piezo-triggered actuator) which opens and
closes the nozzle. This permits control of the
injection process for each cylinder.

Overview of common-rail systems

Design, operating concept

All the injectors are fed by a common fuel
rail, this being the origin of the term “com-
mon rail”.

One of the main features of the common-
rail system is that system pressure is variable
dependent on the engine operating point.
Pressure is adjusted by the pressure-control
valve or the metering unit (Fig. 3).

The modular design of the common-rail sys-
tem simplifies modification of the system to
different engines.

Operating concept

In the common-rail fuel-injection system, the
functions of pressure generation and fuel in-
jection are separate. The injection pressure is
generated independent of the  engine speed
and the injected fuel quantity. The electronic
diesel control (EDC) controls each of the
components.

Pressure generation
Pressure generation and fuel injection are
separated by means of an accumulator vol-
ume. Fuel under pressure is supplied to the
accumulator volume of the common rail
ready for injection. 

A continuously operating high-pressure

pump driven by the engine produces the
 desired injection pressure. Pressure in the fuel
rail is maintained irrespective of engine speed
or injected fuel quantity. Owing to the almost
uniform injection pattern, the high-pressure
pump design can be much smaller and its
drive-system torque can be lower than con-
ventional fuel-injection systems. This results
in a much lower load on the pump drive.

The high-pressure pump is a radial-piston
pump. On commercial vehicles, an in-line
fuel-injection pump is sometimes fitted.

Pressure control
The pressure control method applied is
largely dependent on the system. 

Control on the high-pressure side
On passenger-car systems, the required rail
pressure is controlled on the high-pressure
side by a pressure-control valve (Fig. 3a, 4).
Fuel not required for injection flows back 
to the low-pressure circuit via the  pressure-
control valve. This type of control loop allows
rail pressure to react rapidly to changes in 
operating point (e.g. in the event of load
changes).

Overview of common-rail systems

Operating concept

419

The injector opening times and system
 pressure determine the quantity of fuel
 delivered. At a constant pressure, the fuel
quantity delivered is proportional to the
switching time of the solenoid valve. This is,
therefore, independent of engine or pump
speed (time-based fuel injection).

Potential hydraulic power
Separating the functions of pressure genera-
tion and fuel injection opens up further de-
grees of freedom in the combustion process
compared with conventional fuel-injection
systems; the injection pressure is more or less
freely selectable within the program map. 
The maximum injection pressure at present 
is 1,600 bar; in future this will rise to 
1,800 bar. 

The common-rail system allows a further
reduction in exhaust-gas emissions by intro-
ducing pre-injection events or multiple injec-
tion events and also attenuating combustion
noise significantly. Multiple injection events
of up to five per injection cycle can be gener-
ated by triggering the highly rapid-action
switching valve several times. The nozzle-
needle closing action is hydraulically assisted
to ensure that the end of injection is rapid.

Control on the high-pressure side was
adopted on the first common-rail systems.
The pressure-control valve is mounted prefer-
ably on the fuel rail. In some applications,
however, it is mounted directly on the high-
pressure pump.

Fuel-delivery control on the suction side
Another way of controlling rail pressure is 
to control fuel delivery on the suction side
(Fig. 3b). The metering unit (10) flanged on
the high-pressure pump makes sure that the
pump delivers exactly the right quantity of
fuel to the fuel rail in order to maintain the
injection pressure required by the system. 
In a fault situation, the pressure-relief valve
(9) prevents rail pressure from exceeding a
 maximum. 

Fuel-delivery control on the suction side

reduces the quantity of fuel under high
 pressure and lowers the power input of the
pump. This has a positive impact on fuel con-
sumption. At the same time, the temperature
of the fuel flowing back to the fuel tank is re-
duced in contrast to the control method on
the high-pressure side. 

Two-actuator system
The two-actuator system (Fig. 3c) combines
pressure control on the suction side via the
metering unit and control on the high-pres-
sure side via the pressure-control valve, thus
marrying the advantages of high-pressure-
side control and suction-side fuel-delivery
control (see the section on “Common-rail
system for passenger cars”).

Fuel injection
The injectors spray fuel directly into the en-
gine’s combustion chambers. They are sup-
plied by short high-pressure fuel lines con-
nected to the fuel rail. The engine control
unit controls the switching valve integrated in
the injector to open and close the injector
nozzle.

Overview of common-rail systems

Operating concept

Control and regulation
Operating concept
The engine control unit detects the accelera-
tor-pedal position and the current operating
states of the engine and vehicle by means of
sensors (see the section on “Electronic diesel
control”). The data collected includes:
(cid:3) Crankshaft speed and angle
(cid:3) Fuel-rail pressure
(cid:3) Charge-air pressure
(cid:3) Intake air, coolant temperature, and fuel

temperature
(cid:3) Air-mass intake
(cid:3) Road speed, etc.

The electronic control unit evaluates the
 input signals. In sync with combustion, 
it calculates the triggering signals for the pres-
sure-control valve or the metering unit, the
injectors, and the other actuators (e.g. the
EGR valve, exhaust-gas turbocharger
 actuators, etc.).

The injector switching times, which need to
be short, are achievable using the optimized
high-pressure switching valves and a special
control system.

The angle/time system compares injection

timing, based on data from the crankshaft
and camshaft sensors, with the engine state
(time control). The electronic diesel control
(EDC) permits a precise metering of the in-
jected fuel quantity. In addition, EDC offers
the potential for additional functions that can
improve engine response and convenience.

Basic functions
The basic functions involve the precise con-
trol of diesel-fuel injection timing and fuel
quantity at the reference pressure. In this way,
they ensure that the diesel engine has low
consumption and smooth running character-
istics.

Correction functions for calculating 
fuel injection
A number of correction functions are avail-
able to compensate for tolerances between the
fuel-injection system and the engine (see the
section on “Electronic diesel control”):
(cid:3) Injector delivery compensation
(cid:3) Zero delivery calibration
(cid:3) Fuel-balancing control
(cid:3) Average delivery adaption

Additional functions
Additional open- and closed-loop control
functions perform the tasks of reducing ex-
haust-gas emissions and fuel consumption, 
or providing added safety and convenience.
Some examples are:
(cid:3) Control of exhaust-gas recirculation
(cid:3) Boost-pressure control 
(cid:3) Cruise control
(cid:3) Electronic immobilizer, etc. 

Integrating EDC in an overall vehicle system
opens up a number of new opportunities, 
e.g. data exchange with transmission control
or air-conditioning system.

A diagnosis interface permits analysis of
stored system data when the vehicle is 
serviced.

Control unit configuration
As the engine control unit normally has 
a maximum of only eight output stages 
for the injectors, engines with more than
eight cylinders are fitted with two engine 
control units. They are coupled within the
“master/slave” network via an internal, high-
speed CAN interface. As a result, there is also
a higher microcontroller processing capacity
available. Some functions are permanently 
allocated to a specific control unit (e.g. fuel-
balancing control). Others can be dynami-
cally allocated to one or other of the control
units as situations demand (e.g. to detect 
sensor signals).

Diesel boom in Europe

Diesel boom in Europe

Diesel engine applications 
At the start of automobile history, the spark-
 ignition engine (Otto cycle) was the drive unit
for road vehicles. The first time a diesel engine
was mounted on a truck was 1927. Passenger
cars had to wait until 1936.

The diesel engine made strong headway in

the truck sector due to its fuel economy and
long service life. By contrast, the diesel engine
in the car sector was long relegated to a
fringe existence. It was only with the introduc-
tion of supercharged direct-injection diesel
 engines – the principle of direct injection was
already used in the first truck diesel engines –
that the diesel engine changed its image.
Meanwhile, the percentage of diesel-engined
passenger cars among new registrations is
fast approaching 50% in Europe.

Features of the diesel engine 
What is the reason for the boom in diesel
 engines in Europe? 

Fuel economy
Firstly, fuel consumption compared to gasoline
engines is still lower – this is due to the greater
efficiency of the diesel engine. Secondly, 
diesel fuel is subject to lower taxes in most
 European countries. For people who travel a
lot, therefore, diesel is the more economical
 alternative despite the higher purchase price.

Driving pleasure
Almost all diesel engines on the market are
 supercharged. This produces a high cylinder
charge at low revs. The metered fuel quantity
can also be high, and this produces high en-
gine torque. The result is a torque curve that
permits driving at high torque and low revs. 

It is torque, and not engine performance, 
that is the decisive factor for engine power.
Compared to a gasoline engine without
 supercharging, a driver can experience more
“driving pleasure” with a diesel engine of
lower performance. The image of the “stinking
slowcoach” is simply no longer true for diesel-
engined cars of the latest generation.

Environmental compatibility
The clouds of smoke that diesel-engined cars
produced when driven at high loads are a
thing of the past. This was brought about by
improved fuel-injection systems and electronic
diesel control (EDC). These systems can me-
ter fuel quantity with high precision, adjusting
it to the engine operating point and environ-
mental conditions. This technology also meets
prevailing exhaust-gas emission standards.
Oxidation-type catalytic converters, that
 remove carbon monoxide (CO) and hydro -
carbons (HC) from exhaust gas, are standard
equipment on diesel engines. Future, more
stringent exhaust-gas emission standards, and
even U.S. legislation, will be met by other ex-
haust-gas treatment systems, such as particu-
late filters and NOx accumulator-type catalytic
converters.

Overview of common-rail systems

Common-rail system for passenger cars

Common-rail system for
 passenger cars

Fuel supply
In common-rail systems for passenger cars,
electric fuel pumps or gear pumps are used to
deliver fuel to the high-pressure pump. 

Systems with electric fuel pump
The electric fuel pump is either part of the in-
tank unit (in the fuel tank) or is fitted in the
fuel line (in-line). It intakes fuel via a pre-fil-
ter and delivers it to the high-pressure pump
at a pressure of 6 bar (Fig. 3). The maximum
delivery rate is 190 l/h. To ensure fast engine
starting, the pump switches on as soon as the
driver turns the ignition key. This builds up
the necessary pressure in the low-pressure
circuit when the engine starts.

The fuel filter (fine filter) is fitted in the

supply line to the high-pressure pump.

Systems with gear pump
The gear pump is flanged to the high-pres-
sure pump and is driven by its input shaft
(Figs. 1 and 2). In this way, the gear pump
starts delivery only after the engine has
started. Delivery rate is dependent on the 
engine speed and reaches rates up to 400 l/h
at pressures up to 7 bar.

A fuel pre-filter is fitted in the fuel tank.
The fine filter is located in the supply line to
the gear pump.

Combination systems 
There are also applications where the two
pump types are used. The electric fuel pump
improves starting response, in particular for
hot starts, since the delivery rate of the gear
pump is lower when the fuel is hot, and
therefore, thinner, and at low pump speeds.

High-pressure control
On first-generation common-rail systems,
rail pressure is controlled by the pressure-
control valve. The high-pressure pump 
(type CP1) generates the maximum delivery
quantity, irrespective of fuel demand. The
pressure-control valve returns excess fuel to
the fuel tank.

Second-generation common-rail systems
control rail pressure on the low-pressure side
by means of the metering unit (Figs. 1 and 2).
The high-pressure pump (types CP3 and
CP1H) need only deliver the fuel quantity
that the engine actually requires. This lowers
the energy demand of the high-pressure
pump and reduces fuel consumption.

Third-generation common-rail systems

feature piezo-inline injectors (Fig. 3).

If pressure is only adjustable on the low-pres-
sure side, it takes too long to lower the pres-
sure in the fuel rail when rapid negative load
changes occur. Adapting pressure to  dynamic
changes in load conditions is then too slow.
This is particularly the case with piezo-inline
injectors due to their very low internal leak-
age. For this reason, some common-rail sys-
tems are equipped with an additional pres-
sure-control valve (Fig. 3) besides the high-
pressure pump and metering unit. This
two-actuator system combines the advantages
of control on the low-pressure side with the
dynamic response of control on the high-
pressure side. 

Another advantage compared with control
on the low-pressure side only is that the high-
pressure side is also controllable when the 
engine is cold. The high-pressure pump then
delivers more fuel than is injected and pres-
sure is controlled by the pressure-control
valve. Compression heats the fuel, thus elimi-
nating the need for an additional fuel heater.

Overview of diesel fuel-injection systems

Areas of application
Diesel engines are characterized by high fuel
economy. Since the first volume-production
fuel-injection pump was introduced by Bosch
in 1927, fuel-injection systems have experi-
enced a process of continuous development.

Requirements
Ever stricter statutory regulations on noise and
exhaust-gas emissions and the desire for more
economical fuel consumption continually place
greater demands on the fuel-injection system
of a diesel engine.

Diesel engines are used in a wide variety of
design for many different purposes (Fig. 1 and
Table 1), for example
(cid:3) To drive mobile power generators 
(up to approx. 10 kW/cylinder)
(cid:3) As fast-running engines for cars 

and light-duty trucks 
(up to approx. 50 kW/cylinder)

(cid:3) As engines for construction-industry 

and agricultural machinery 
(up to approx. 50 kW/cylinder)

(cid:3) As engines for heavy trucks, 

omnibuses and tractor vehicles 
(up to approx. 80 kW/cylinder)
(cid:3) To drive fixed installations such 

as emergency power generators 
(up to approx. 160 kW/cylinder)
(cid:3) As engines for railway locomotives 
and ships (up to 1,000 kW/cylinder)

1

Applications for Bosch diesel fuel-injection systems

Basically, the fuel-injection system is required
to inject a precisely metered amount of fuel at
high pressure into the combustion chamber 
in such a way that it mixes effectively with the
air in the cylinder as demanded by the type 
of engine (direct or indirect-injection) and its
present operating status. The power output
and speed of a diesel engine is controlled by
means of the injected fuel quantity as it has no
air intake throttle.

Mechanical control of diesel fuel-injection
 systems is being increasingly replaced by
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) systems. 
All new diesel-injection systems for cars 
and commercial vehicles are electronically
controlled.

Fuel filtering
As opposed to passenger-car systems, the fuel
filter (fine filter) is fitted to the pressure side.
For this reason, an exterior fuel inlet is re-
quired, in particular when the gear pump is
flanged to the high-pressure pump.

Common-rail systems for light-duty trucks

Electric fuel pumps or gear pumps are used

for heavy-duty trucks, only gear pumps are
used to deliver fuel to the high-pressure
pump (see the subsection “Gear-type supply
pumps” in the section “Fuel supply in the
low-pressure stage”). The presupply pump is
normally flanged to the high-pressure pump

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Overview

High-pressure components of common-rail system

The high-pressure stage of the common-rail
system is divided into three sections: pres-
sure generation, pressure storage, and fuel
metering. The high-pressure pump assumes
the function of pressure generation. Pres-
sure storage takes place in the fuel rail to
which the rail-pressure sensor and the pres-
sure-control and pressure-relief valves are
fitted. The function of the injectors is cor-
rect timing and metering the quantity of

fuel injected. High-pressure fuel lines inter-
connect the three sections.

Overview

The main difference in the various genera-
tions of common-rail systems lie in the de-
sign of the high-pressure pump and the in-
jectors, and in the system functions required

and the camshaft position (phase detection). 
An optimum mixture formation is re-
quired to reduce exhaust-gas emissions and
comply with continuous demands to reduce
the noise of diesel engines. This calls for 
injectors with very small pre-injection quan-
tities and multiple injection events.

There are presently three different injector
types in serial production:

(cid:3) Injector with piezo actuator

Injector

On a common-rail diesel injection system,
the injectors are connected to the fuel rail by
short high-pressure fuel lines. The injectors
are sealed to the combustion chamber by a
copper gasket. The injectors are fitted into 
the cylinder head by means of taper locks.
Depending on the injection-nozzle design,
common-rail injectors are intended for
straight or inclined mounting in direct-
 injection diesel engines.

One of the system’s features is that it gener-
ates an injection pressure irrespective of
 engine speed or injected fuel quantity. The
start of injection and injected fuel quantity
are controlled by the electrically triggered 
injector. The injection time is controlled 
by the angle/time system of the Electronic
Diesel Control (EDC). This requires the use

Solenoid-valve injector
Design
The injector can be subdivided into a number
of function modules:
(cid:3) The hole-type nozzle (see the section on

“Injection nozzle”)

(cid:3) The hydraulic servo system
(cid:3) The solenoid valve

Fuel is conveyed by the high-pressure connec-
tion (Fig. 1a, 13) via a supply passage to the
injection nozzle and via an inlet restrictor
(14) to the valve-control chamber (6). The
valve-control chamber is connected to the
fuel return (1) via the outlet restrictor (12)
which can be opened by a solenoid valve.

Operating concept
The function of the injector can be subdi-
vided into four operating states when the 
engine and the high-pressure pump are
 operating:
(cid:3) Injector closed (with high pressure

 applied)

(cid:3) Injector opens (start of injection)
(cid:3) Injector fully open
(cid:3) Injector closes (end of injection)

The operating states are caused by the balance
of forces acting on the injector components.
When the engine is not running and the fuel
rail is not pressurized, the nozzle spring closes
the injector.

Injector closed (resting position)
In its resting position, the injector is not trig-
gered (Fig. 1a). The solenoid-valve spring
(11) presses the valve ball (5) onto the seat of
the outlet restrictor (12). Inside of the valve-
control chamber, the pressure rises to the
pressure in the fuel rail. The same pressure is
also applied to the chamber volume (9) of the
nozzle. The forces applied by the rail pressure
to the end faces of the control plunger (15),
and the force of the nozzle spring (7) retain
the nozzle needle closed against the opening
force applied to its pressure shoulders (8).

Injector opens (start of injection)
To begin with, the injector is in its resting po-
sition. The solenoid valve is triggered by the
“pickup current”. This makes the solenoid
valve open very rapidly (Fig. 1b). The re-
quired rapid switching times are achieved by
controlling solenoid-valve triggering in the
ECU at high voltages and currents.

The magnetic force of the now triggered
electromagnet exceeds the force of the valve
spring. The armature raises the valve ball
from the valve seat and opens the outlet
 restrictor. After a short time the increased
pickup current is reduced to a lower holding
current in the electromagnet. When the  outlet
restrictor opens, fuel flows from the valve-
control chamber to the cavity above and then
via the fuel-return line to the fuel tank. The
inlet restrictor (14) prevents a complete pres-
sure compensation. As a result, pressure in
the valve-control chamber drops. Pressure in
the valve-control chamber falls below the
pressure in the nozzle chamber, which is still
the same as the pressure in the fuel rail. The
reduction in pressure in the valve-control
chamber reduces the force acting on the con-
trol plunger and opens the nozzle needle. Fuel
injection commences.

Injector fully open
The rate of movement of the nozzle needle is
determined by the difference in the flow rates
through the inlet and outlet restrictors. The
control plunger reaches its upper stop and
dwells there on a cushion of fuel (hydraulic
stop). The cushion is created by the flow of
fuel between the inlet and outlet  restrictors.
The injector nozzle is then fully open. Fuel is
injected into the combustion chamber at a
pressure approaching that in the fuel rail.
The balance of forces in the injector is 
similar to that during the opening phase. 
At a given system pressure, the fuel quantity
injected is proportional to the length of time
that the solenoid valve is open. This is entirely
independent of the engine or pump speed
(time-based injection system).

434

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Injector closes (end of injection)
When the solenoid valve is no longer trig-
gered, the valve spring presses the armature
down and the valve ball closes the outlet re-
strictor (Fig. 1c). When the outlet restrictor
closes, pressure in the control chamber rises
again to that in the fuel rail via the inlet re-
strictor. The higher pressure exerts a greater
force on the control plunger. The force on 
the valve-control chamber and the nozzle-
spring force then exceed the force acting 
on the nozzle needle, and the nozzle needle
closes. The flow rate of the inlet restrictor de-
termines the closing speed of the nozzle nee-
dle. The fuel-injection cycle comes to an end
when the nozzle needle is resting against its
seat, thus closing off the injection orifices.

This indirect method is used to trigger the
nozzle needle by means of a hydraulic servo
system because the forces required to open the
nozzle needle rapidly cannot be generated 
directly by the solenoid valve. The  “control 
volume” required in addition to the injected
fuel quantity reaches the fuel-return line via
the restrictors in the control chamber. 

In addition to the control volume, there are
also leakage volumes through the nozzle-nee-
dle and valve-plunger guides. The control and
leakage volumes are returned to the fuel tank
via the fuel-return line and a collective line
that comprises an overflow valve, high-pres-
sure pump, and pressure-control valve.

Program-map variants
Program maps with fuel-quantity flat curve
With injectors, a distinction is made in the
program map between ballistic and non -
ballistic modes. The valve plunger/nozzle
needle unit reaches the hydraulic stop if the
triggering period in vehicle operation is of
sufficient length (Fig. 2a). The section until
the nozzle needle reaches its maximum stroke
is termed ballistic mode. The ballistic and
nonballistic sections in the fuel-quantity
map, where the injected fuel quantity is ap-
plied for the triggering period (Fig. 2b), is
separated by a kink in the program map. 

Another feature of the fuel-quantity map is
the flat curve that occurs with small triggering
periods. The flat curve is caused by the sole-
noid armature rebounding on opening. In this
section, the injected fuel quantity is indepen-
dent on the triggering period. This allows
small injected fuel quantities to be represented
as stable. Only after the armature has stopped
rebounding does the  injected fuel quantity
curve continue to rise linearly as the triggering
period becomes longer. 

Injection events with small injected fuel
quantities (short triggering periods) are used
as pre-injection in order to suppress noise.
Secondary injection events help to  enhance
soot oxidation in selected sections of the 
operating curve.

Program maps without fuel-quantity flat curve
The increasing stringency of emission-control
legislation has lead to the use of the two sys-
tem functions: injector delivery compensation
(IMA) and zero delivery calibration (NMK), as
well as to short intervals in injection between
pre-injection, main injection, and secondary
injection events. With injectors that have no
flat-curve section, IMA  allows a precise ad-
justment of the pre-injection fuel quantity
when new. NMK corrects fuel-quantity drifts
over time in the low-pressure section. The key
condition for deploying these two system
functions is a constant, linear rise in quantity,
i.e. there is no flat curve in the fuel-quantity
map (Fig. 2c). If the valve plunger/nozzle nee-
dle unit is operated in nominal mode without
lift-stop at the same time, this represents a
fully ballistic operating mode of the valve
plunger and there is no kink in the fuel-quan-
tity map. 

Injector variants
A distinction is made between two different
solenoid-valve concepts with solenoid-valve
injectors: 
(cid:3) Injectors with one-part armature 

(1-spring system)

(cid:3) Injectors with two-part armature 

(2-spring system)

High-pressure components of common-rail system

The short intervals between injection events
are ensured when the armature can return to
its resting position very rapidly on closing.
This is best achieved by a two-part armature
with an overstroke stop. During the closing
process, the armature plate moves down by
positive locking. The bottoming-out of the
armature plate is limited by an overstroke
stop. As a result, the armature reaches its
resting position faster. Armature rebound 

on closing can end faster by decoupling the
armature masses and adapting the setting
parameters. This helps to achieve shorter
 intervals between two injection events with
the two-part armature concept.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Holding-current phase
In order to reduce power loss in the ECU and
injector, the current is dropped to approx.
13 A in the holding-current phase. 
The energy which becomes available when
pickup current and holding current are
 reduced is routed to the booster-voltage
 capacitor. 

Switchoff
When the current is switched off in order 
to close the solenoid valve, the surplus energy
is also routed to the booster-voltage  capacitor.

Recharging the step-up chopper
Recharging takes place by means of a step-up
chopper integrated in the ECU. The energy
tapped during the opening phase is recharged
at the start of the pickup phase until the 
original voltage required to open the solenoid
valve is reached.

Triggering the solenoid-valve injector
In its resting position, the injector’s high-
pressure solenoid valve is not triggered and is
therefore closed. The injector injects when
the solenoid valve opens. 

Triggering the solenoid valve is divided into

five phases (Figs. 3 and 4).

Opening phase
Initially, in order to ensure tight tolerances
and high levels of reproducibility for the in-
jected fuel quantity, the current for opening
the solenoid valve features a steep, precisely
defined flank and increases rapidly up to
 approx. 20 A. This is achieved by means of a
booster voltage of up to 50 V. It is generated in
the control unit and stored in a capacitor
(booster-voltage capacitor). When this volt-
age is applied across the solenoid valve, the
current increases several times faster than it
does when only battery voltage is used.

Pickup-current phase
During the pickup-current phase, battery
voltage is applied to the solenoid valve and
assists in opening it quickly. Current control
limits pickup current to approx. 20 A.

Piezo-inline injector
Design and requirements
The design of the piezo-inline injector 
is divided into its main modules in the
schematic (see Fig. 5):
(cid:3) Actuator module (3) 
(cid:3) Hydraulic coupler or translator (4) 
(cid:3) Control or servo valve (5) 
(cid:3) Nozzle module (6)

The design of the injector took account of the
high overall rigidity required within the actu-
ator chain composed of actuator, hydraulic
coupler, and control valve. Another design
feature is the avoidance of mechanical forces

acting on the nozzle needle. Such forces 
occurred as a result of the push rod used 
on previous solenoid-valve injectors. On 
aggregate, this design effectively reduces the
moving masses and friction, thus enhancing
injector stability and drift compared to con-
ventional systems.

In addition, the fuel-injection system
 allows the implementation of very short in-
tervals (“hydraulic zero”) between injection
events. The number and configuration of
fuel-metering operations can represent up 
to five injection events per injection cycle 
in order to adapt the requirements to the
 engine operating points.

A direct response of the needle to actuator

operation is achieved by coupling the servo
valve (5) to the nozzle needle. The delay
 between the electric start of triggering and
hydraulic response of the nozzle needle is
about 150 microseconds. This meets the con-
tradictory requirements of high needle speeds
and extremely small reproducible  injected
fuel quantities.

As a result of this principle, the injector also

includes small direct leakage points from the
high-pressure section to the low-pressure cir-
cuit. The result is an increase in the hydraulic
efficiency of the overall system.

Operating concept
Function of the 3/2-way servo valve in the 
CR injector
The nozzle needle on piezo-inline injector 
is controlled indirectly by a servo valve. 
The required injected fuel quantity is then
controlled by the valve triggering period. 
In its non-triggered state, the actuator is 
in the starting position and the servo valve 
is closed (Fig. 6a), i.e. the high-pressure
 section is separated from the low-pressure
 section. 

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

439

The nozzle is kept closed by the rail pressure
exerted in the control chamber (3). When the
piezo actuator is triggered, the servo valve
opens and closes the bypass passage (Fig. 6b).
The flow-rate ratio between the outlet restric-
tor (2) and the inlet restrictor (4) lowers pres-
sure in the control chamber and the nozzle
(5) opens. The control volume flows via the
servo valve to the low-pressure circuit of the
overall system.

To start the closing process, the actuator 

is discharged and the servo valve releases 
the bypass passage. The control chamber is
then refilled by reversing the inlet and outlet
restrictors, and pressure in the control cham-
ber is raised. As soon as the required pressure
is attained, the nozzle needle starts to move
and the injection process ends. 

The valve design described above and 
the greater dynamic design of the actuator
system result in much shorter injection times
compared to injectors of conventional design,
i.e. push rod and 2/2-way valve.  Ultimately,
this has a positive impact on  exhaust-gas
emissions and engine performance. Due to
requirements regarding the engine in EU 4,
the injector program maps were optimized to
apply corrective functions (injector delivery
compensation (IMA) and zero delivery cali-

bration (NMK). The pre-injection quantity
can then be selected at will, and IMA can
minimize the quantity spread in the program
map using full ballistic mode (see Fig. 7).

Function of the hydraulic coupler
Another key component in the piezo-inline
injector is the hydraulic coupler (Fig. 8, 3)
that implements the following functions:
(cid:3) Translates and amplifies the actuator

stroke.

(cid:3) Compensates for any play between the

 actuator and the servo valve (e.g. caused by
thermal expansion).

(cid:3) Performs a failsafe function (automatic
safety cutoff of fuel injection if electrical
decontacting fails).

The actuator module and the hydraulic coupler
are immersed in the diesel fuel flow at a pres-
sure of about 10 bar. When the actuator is not
triggered, pressure in the hydraulic coupler is in
equilibrium with its surroundings. Changes in
length caused by temperature are compensated
by small leakage-fuel quantities via the guide
clearances of the two plungers. This maintains
the coupling of forces between  actuator and
switching valve at all times.

Function of the hydraulic coupler

To generate an injection event, a voltage
(110...150 V) is applied to the actuator 
until the equilibrium of forces between the
switch ing valve and the actuator is exceeded.
This increases the pressure in the coupler, and
a small leakage volume flows out of the cou-
pler via the piston guide clearances into the
low-pressure circuit of the injector. The pres-
sure drop caused in the coupler has no im-
pact on injector function for a triggering 
period lasting several milliseconds.

At the end of the injection process, the
quantity missing in the hydraulic coupler
needs refilling. This takes place in the reverse
direction via the guide clearances of the
plungers as a result of the pressure difference
between the hydraulic coupler and the low-
pressure circuit of the injector. The guide
clearances and the low-pressure level are
matched to fill up the hydraulic coupler fully
before the next injection cycle starts.

Triggering sequences of the piezo-inline injector for an injection event

Triggering the common-rail piezo 
in-line injector
The injector is triggered by an engine control
unit whose output stage was specially designed
for these injectors. A reference triggering volt-
age is predetermined as a function of the rail
pressure of the set operating point. The voltage
signal is pulsed (Fig. 9) until there is a mini-
mum deviation between the reference and the
control voltage. The voltage rise is converted
proportionally into a piezoelectric actuator
stroke. The actuator stroke produces a pressure
rise in the coupler by means of hydraulic
translation until the equilibrium of forces is
exceeded at the switching valve, and the valve
opens. As soon as the
switching valve reaches
its end position, pres-
sure in the control
chamber starts to 
drop via the needle,
and injection ends.

The piezoelectric effect

(cid:0)

The piezoelectric effect

In 1880 Pierre Curie and his brother Jacques
discovered a phenomenon that is still very lit-
tle known today, but is present in the everyday
lives of millions of people: the piezoelectric
 effect. For example, it keeps the pointers of 
a crystal clock operating in time.

Certain crystals (e.g. quartz and turmaline) are
piezoelectric: Electric charges are induced on
the crystal surface by exerting a compression
or elongation force along certain crystal axes.
This electrical polarization arises by shifting
positive and negative ions in the crystal rela-
tive to each other by exerting force (see Fig.,
b). The shifted centers of charge gravity within
the crystal compensate automatically, but an
electric field forms between the end faces of
the crystal. Compressing and elongating the
crystal create inverse field directions.

On the other hand, if an electrical voltage 
is applied to the end faces of the crystal, the
effect reverses (inverse piezoelectric effect):
The positive ions in the electric field migrate
toward the negative electrode, and negative
ions toward the positive electrode. The crystal
then contracts or expands depending on the
direction of the electric field strength (see
Fig., c). 

The following applies to piezoelectric field
strength Ep:
Ep = δ ∆x/x
∆x/x: relative compression or elongation
δ:

piezoelectric coefficient, numeric value
109 V/cm through 1011 V/cm

The change in length ∆x results from the
 following when a voltage U is applied: 
U / δ = ∆x (using quartz as an example:
 deformation of about 10–9 cm at U = 10 V)

The piezoelectric effect is not only used in
quartz clocks and piezo-inline injectors, it has
many other industrial applications, either as a
direct or inverse effect: 

Piezoelectric sensors are used for knock
control in gasoline engines. For example, they
detect high-frequency engine vibrations as a
feature of combustion knock. Converting me-
chanical vibration to electric voltage is also
used in the crystal audio pickup of a record
player or crystal microphones. The piezoelec-
tric igniter (e.g. in a firelighter) causes me-
chanical pressure to produce the voltage to
generate a spark.

On the other hand, if an alternating voltage

is applied to a piezoelectrical crystal, it vi-
brates mechanically at the same frequency 
as the alternating voltage. Oscillating crystals
are used as stabilizers in electrical oscillating
circuits or as piezoelectric acoustic sources 
to generate ultrasound. 

When used in clocks, the oscillating quartz

is excited by an alternating voltage whose
 frequency is the same as the quartz’s natural
frequency. This is how an extremely time-con-
stant resonant frequency is generated. In a
calibrated quartz, it deviates by only approx.
1/1,000 second per year.

Where does the word “electronics” come from?

443

(cid:0)

Where does the word “electronics” come from?

This term actually goes back to the ancient
Greeks. For them, the word “electron” meant
amber. Its force of attraction on woollen
threads or similar was known to Thales von
Milet over 2,500 years ago. 

Electrons, and therefore electronics as such,
are extremely fast due to their very small mass
and electric charge. The term “electronics”
comes directly from the word “electron”.

The mass of an electron has as little effect
on a gram of any given substance as a 5 gram
weight has on the total mass of our earth. 

The word “electronics” was born in the
20th century. There is no evidence available
as to when the word was used for the first
time. It could be Sir John Ambrose Fleming,
one of the inventors of the electron tube in
about 1902.

Even the first “Electronic Engineer” already
 existed in the 19th century. Fleming was listed
in the 1888 edition of “Who’s Who”, pub-
lished during the reign of Queen Victoria. The
official title was “Kelly’s Handbook of Titled,
Landed and Official Classes”. The Electronic
Engineer can be found under the title “Royal
Warrant Holders”, that is the list of persons
who had been awarded a Royal Warrant. 

What was this Electronic Engineer’s job?
He was responsible for the correct functioning
and cleanliness of the gas lamps at court. 
And why did he have such a splendid title?
Because he knew that “electrons” in ancient
Greece stood for glitter, shine, and sparkle.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

The pump plunger inside of the high-pres-
sure pump compresses the fuel. At three
 delivery strokes per revolution, the radial-
piston pump produces overlapping delivery
strokes (no interruption in delivery), low
drive peak torques, and an even load on the
pump drive. 

On passenger-car systems, torque reaches

16 Nm, i.e. only 1/9th of the drive torque
 required for a comparable distributor injec-
tion pump. As a result, the common-rail
 system places fewer demands on the pump-
drive system than conventional fuel-injection
systems. The power required to drive the
pump increases in proportion to the pressure
in the fuel rail and the rotational speed of the
pump (delivery quantity). 
On a 2-liter engine, the high-pressure pump
draws a power of 3.8 kW at nominal speed
and a pressure of 1,350 bar in the fuel rail 
(at a mechanical efficiency of approx. 90%).
The higher power requirements of common-
rail systems compared to conventional fuel-
injection systems is caused by leakage and
control volumes in the injector, and – on the
high-pressure pump CP1 – the pressure drop
to the required system pressure across the
pressure-control valve.

The high-pressure radial-piston pumps used
in passenger cars are lubricated by fuel. Com-
mercial-vehicle systems may have fuel- or 
oil-lubricated radial-piston pumps, as well as
oil-lubricated 2-plunger in-line fuel-injection
pumps. Oil-lubricated pumps are more ro-
bust against poor fuel quality.

High-pressure pumps are used in a number
of different designs in passenger cars and
commercial vehicles. There are versions of
pump generations that have different delivery
rates and delivery pressures (Table 1).

High-pressure pumps

Design and requirements
The high-pressure pump is the interface be-
tween the low-pressure and high-pressure
stages. Its function is to make sure there is al-
ways sufficient fuel under pressure available
in all engine operating conditions. At the
same time it must operate for the entire 
service life of the vehicle. This includes
 providing a fuel reserve that is required for
quick engine starting and rapid pressure rise
in the fuel rail.

The high-pressure pump generates a con-
stant system pressure for the high-pressure 
accumulator (fuel rail) independent of fuel 
injection. For this reason, fuel – compared to
conventional fuel-injection systems – is not
compressed during the injection process.

A 3-plunger radial-piston pump is used as the
high-pressure pump to generate pressure in
passenger-car systems. 2-plunger in-line fuel-
injection pumps are also used on commercial
vehicles. Preferably, the high-pressure pump
is fitted to the diesel engine at the same point
as a conventional distributor injection pump.
The pump is driven by the engine via cou-
pling, gearwheel, chain, or toothed belt.
Pump speed is therefore coupled to engine
speed via a fixed gear ratio.

behind the inlet. If the delivery pressure of
the presupply pump exceeds the opening
pressure (0.5 to 1.5 bar) of the safety valve,
the fuel is pressed through the restriction
bore of the safety valve into the lubrication
and cooling circuit of the high-pressure
pump. The drive shaft with its eccenter moves
the pump plunger up and down to mimic the
eccentric lift. Fuel passed through the high-
pressure pump’s inlet valve (4) into the ele-
ment chamber and the pump plunger moves
downward (inlet stroke). 

When the bottom-dead center of the pump

plunger is exceeded, the inlet valve closes, 
and the fuel in the element chamber can no
longer escape. It can then be pressurized be-
yond the delivery pressure of the presupply
pump. The rising pressure opens the outlet
valve (5) as soon as pressure reaches the level
in the fuel rail. The pressurized fuel then
passes to the high-pressure circuit.

Radial-piston pump (CP1)
Design 
The drive shaft in the housing of CP1 is
mounted in a central bearing (Fig. 1, 1). 
The pump elements (3) are arranged radially
with respect to the central bearing and offset
by 120°. The eccenter (2) fitted to the drive
shaft forces the pump plunger to move up
and down.

Force is transmitted between the eccentric
shaft and the delivery plunger by means of 
a drive roller, a sliding ring mounted on the
shaft eccenter, and a plunger base plate at-
tached to the plunger base plate.

Operating concept
Fuel delivery and compression
The presupply pump – an electric fuel pump
or a mechanically driven gear pump – deliv-
ers fuel via a filter and water separator to the
inlet of the high-pressure pump (6). The inlet
is located inside of the pump on passenger-
car systems with a gear pump flanged to the
high-pressure pump. A safety valve is fitted

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

Delivery rate
As the high-pressure pump is designed for
high delivery quantities, there is a surplus 
of pressurized fuel when the engine is idling
or running in part-load range. On first-
 generation systems with a CP1, excess fuel 
delivered is returned to the fuel tank by the
pressure-control valve on the fuel rail. As 
the compressed fuel expands, the energy
 imparted by compression is lost; overall
 efficiency drops. Compressing and then
 expanding the fuel also heats the fuel.

The pump plunger continues to deliver fuel
until it reaches its top-dead center position
(delivery stroke). The pressure then drops so
that the outlet valve closes. The remaining
fuel is depressurized and the pump plunger
moves downward.

When the pressure in the element chamber

exceeds the pre-delivery pressure, the inlet
valve reopens, and the process starts over.

Transmission ratio
The delivery quantity of a high-pressure
pump is proportional to its rotational speed.
In turn, the pump speed is dependent on 
the engine speed. The transmission ratio
 between the engine and the pump is deter-
mined in the process of adapting the fuel-
 injection system to the engine so as to limit
the volume of excess fuel delivered. At the
same time it makes sure that the engine’s fuel
demand at WOT is covered to the full extent.
Possible gear ratios are 1:2 or 2:3  relative to
the crankshaft.

Metering unit design

Radial-piston pump (CP1H)
Modifications
An improvement in energetic efficiency is
possible by controlling fuel delivery by the
high-pressure pump on the fuel-delivery side
(suction side). Fuel flowing into the pump 
element is metered by an infinitely variable
solenoid valve (metering unit, ZME). This
valve adapts the fuel quantity delivered to the
rail to system demand. This fuel-delivery con-
trol not only drops the  performance demand
of the high-pressure pump, it also reduces the
maximum fuel temperature. This system de-
signed for the CP1H was taken over by the
CP3.

Compared to the high-pressure pump CP1,
the CP1H is designed for higher pressures up
to 1,600 bar. This was achieved by reinforcing
the drive mechanism, modifying the valve
units, and introducing measures to increase
the strength of the pump housing.

The metering unit is mounted on the high-

pressure pump (Fig. 3, 13).

Design of the metering unit (ZME)
Fig. 4 shows the design of the metering unit.
The plunger operated by solenoid force frees
up a metering orifice depending on its posi-
tion.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

Radial-piston pump (CP3)
Modifications
The CP3 is a high-pressure pump with suc-
tion-side fuel-delivery control by means of a
metering unit (ZME). This control was first
used on the CP3 and was assumed later on
the CP1H. 

The principle design of the CP3 (Fig. 5) is
similar to the CP1 and the CP1H. The main
difference in features are:
(cid:3) Monobloc housing: This construction

 reduces the number of leak points in the
high-pressure section, and permits a higher
delivery rate.

(cid:3) Bucket tappets: Transverse forces arising
from the transverse movement of the
 eccenter drive roller are not removed di-
rectly by the pump plungers but by buckets
on the housing wall. The pump then has
greater stability under load and is  capable
of withstanding higher pressures. Poten-
tially, it can withstand pressures up to 
1,800 bar.

Variants
Pumps of the CP3 family are used in both
passenger cars and commercial vehicles. 
A number of different variants are used
 depending on the delivery rate required. The
size, and thus the delivery rate, increases from
the CP3.2 to the CP3.4. The oil-lubricated
CP3.4 is only used on heavy-duty trucks. On
light-duty trucks and vans, pumps primarily
designed for passenger cars may also be used.
A special feature of systems for medium-
duty and heavy-duty trucks is the fuel filter
located on the pressure side. It is situated 
between the gear pump and the high-pressure
pump, and permits a greater filter storage 
capacity before requiring a change. The high-
pressure pump requires an external connec-
tion for the fuel inlet in any case, even if the
gear pump is flanged onto the high-pressure
pump.

Lube oil is supplied either directly via the
mounting flange of the CP2 or a side-
mounted inlet.

The drive gear ratio is 1:2. The CP2 is there-
fore mountable together with conventional
in-line fuel-injection pumps. 

Operating concept
Fuel enters the pump element and the com-
pressed fuel is conveyed to the fuel rail via a
combined inlet/outlet valve on the CP2. 

In-line piston pump (CP2)
Design
The oil-lubricated, quantity-controlled high-
pressure pump (CP2) is only used on com-
mercial vehicles. This is a 2-plunger pump
with an in-line design, i.e. the two pump
plungers are arranged adjacently (Fig. 6). 

A gear pump with a high gear ratio is lo-
cated on the camshaft extension. Its function
is to draw fuel from the fuel tank and route it
to the fine filter. From there, the fuel passes
through another line to the metering unit lo-
cated on the upper section of the high-pres-
sure pump. The metering unit controls the
fuel quantity delivered for compression de-
pendent on actual demand in the same way as
other common-rail high-pressure pumps of
the recent generation.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Fuel rail (high-pressure accumulator)

Fuel rail (high-pressure
 accumulator)

Function
The function of the high-pressure accumula-
tor (fuel rail) is to maintain the fuel at high
pressure. In so doing, the accumulator vol-
ume has to dampen pressure fluctuations
caused by fuel pulses delivered by the pump
and the fuel-injection cycles. This ensures
that, when the injector opens, the injection
pressure remains constant. On the one hand,
the accumulator volume must be large
enough to meet this requirement. On the
other hand, it must be small enough to en-
sure a fast enough pressure rise on engine
start. Simulation calculations are conducted
during the design phase to optimize the per-
formance features.

Besides acting as a fuel accumulator, the
fuel rail also distributes fuel to the injectors.

Design
The tube-shaped fuel rail (Fig. 1, 1) can have
as many designs as there are engine mounting
variants. It has mountings for the rail-pres-
sure sensor (5) and a pressure-relief valve or
pressure-control valve (2).

Operating concept
The pressurized fuel delivered by the high-
pressure pump passes via a high-pressure fuel
line to the fuel-rail inlet (4). From there, it is
distributed to the individual injectors (hence
the term “common rail”).

The fuel pressure is measured by the rail-
pressure sensor and controlled to the required
value by the pressure-control valve. The pres-
sure-relief valve is used as an alternative to
the pressure-control valve – depending on
system requirements – and its function is to
limit fuel pressure in the fuel rail to the maxi-
mum permissible pressure. The highly com-
pressed fuel is routed from the fuel rail to the
injectors via high-pressure delivery lines.

The cavity inside the fuel rail is permanently
filled with pressurized fuel. The compressibil-
ity of the fuel under high pressure is utilized
to achieve an accumulator effect. When fuel 
is released from the fuel rail for injection, the
pressure in the high-pressure accumulator 
remains virtually constant, even when large
quantities of fuel are released.

High-pressure sensors

Application
In automotive applications, high-pressure
sensors are used for measuring the pressures
of fuels and brake fluids. 

Diesel rail-pressure sensor 
In the diesel engine, the rail-pressure sensor
measures the pressure in the fuel rail of the
common-rail accumulator-type injection sys-
tem. Maximum operating (nominal) pressure
pmax is 160 MPa (1,600 bar). Fuel pressure is
controlled by a closed control loop, and re-
mains practically constant independent of
load and engine speed. Any deviations from
the setpoint pressure are compensated for by
a pressure-control valve.

Gasoline rail-pressure sensor
As its name implies, this sensor measures the
pressure in the fuel rail of the DI Motronic
with gasoline direct injection. Pressure is a
function of load and engine speed and is
5...12 MPa (50...120 bar), and is used as an
actual (measured) value in the closed-loop
rail-pressure control. The rpm and load-
 dependent setpoint value is stored in a map
and is adjusted at the rail by a pressure 
control valve.

Brake-fluid pressure sensor
Installed in the hydraulic modulator of 
such driving-safety systems as ESP, this 
high- pressure sensor is used to measure 
the brake-fluid pressure which is usually
25 MPa (250 bar). Maximum pressure pmax
can climb to as much as 35 MPa (350 bar).
 Pressure measurement and monitoring is
triggered by the ECU which also evaluates 
the return signals.

Design and operating concept
The heart of the sensor is a steel diaphragm
onto which deformation resistors have been
vapor-deposited in the form of a bridge  
 cir cuit (Fig. 1, 3). The sensor’s pres  sure-
measuring range depends on diaphragm
thickness (thicker diaphragms for higher

pressures and thinner ones for lower pres-
sures). When the pressure is applied via the
pressure connection (4) to one of the dia -
phragm faces, the resistances of the bridge re-
sistors change due to diaphragm deformation
(approx. 20 μm at 1,500 bar). 

The 0...80 mV output voltage generated by
the bridge is conducted to an evaluation cir-
cuit which amplifies it to 0...5 V. This is used
as the input to the ECU which refers to a
stored characteristic curve in calculating the
pressure (Fig. 2).

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Pressure-control valve

Pressure-control valve activated 
When the pressure in the high-pressure cir-
cuit needs to be increased, the force of the
electromagnet is added to that of the spring.
The pressure-control valve is activated and
closes until a state of equilibrium is reached
between the high pressure and the combined
force of the electromagnet and the spring. 
At this point, it remains in partly open posi-
tion and maintains a constant pressure.
 Variations in the delivery quantity of the
high-pressure pump and the withdrawal 
of fuel from the fuel rail by the injectors are
compensated by varying the valve aperture.
The magnetic force of the electromagnet 
is proportional to the control current. The
control current is varied by pulse-width 
modulation. A pulse frequency of 1 kHz is
sufficiently high to prevent adverse armature
movement or pressure fluctuations in the 
fuel rail.

Designs 
The pressure-control valve DRV1 is used in
first-generation common-rail systems. Sec-
ond- and third-generation CR systems oper-
ate using the two-actuator concept. Here, the
rail pressure is adjusted by both a metering
unit as well as a pressure-control valve. In this

Pressure-control valve DRV1 (section)

Pressure-control valve

Function
The function of the pressure-control valve 
is to adjust and maintain the pressure in the
fuel rail as a factor of engine load, i.e.:
(cid:3) It opens when the rail pressure is too high.
Part of the fuel then returns from the fuel
rail via a common line to the fuel tank.
(cid:3) It closes when the rail pressure is too low,

thus sealing the high-pressure side from the
low-pressure side.

Design
The pressure-control valve (Fig. 1) has a
mounting flange which attaches it to the
high-pressure pump or the fuel rail. The
 armature (5) forces a valve ball (6) against the
valve seat in order to seal the high-pressure
stage from the low-pressure stage; this is
achieved by the combined action of a valve
spring (2) and an electromagnet (4) which
force the armature downwards.

Fuel flows around the whole of the arma-

ture for lubrication and cooling purposes.

Operating concept
The pressure-control valve has two closed
control loops:
(cid:3) A slower, closed electrical control loop for
setting a variable average pressure level in
the fuel rail.

(cid:3) A faster hydromechanical control loop for
balancing out high-frequency pressure
pulses.

Pressure-control valve not activated 
The high pressure present in the fuel rail or 
at the high-pressure pump outlet is applied 
to the pressure-control valve via the high-
pressure fuel supply. As the deengerized 
electromagnet exerts no force, the high-
pressure force is greater than the spring force.
The pressure-control valve opens to a greater
or lesser extent depending on the delivery
quantity. The spring is dimensioned to 
maintain a pressure of approx. 100 bar.

case, either the pressure-control valve DRV2
is used or the DRV3 variant for higher pres-
sures. This control strategy achieves lower
fuel heating and eliminates the need for a fuel
cooler.

The DRV2/3 (Fig. 2) differs from the DRV1
in the following features:
(cid:3) Hard seal to the high-pressure interface

(bite edge).

(cid:3) Optimized magnetic circuit (lower power

consumption).

Pressure-relief valve

Function
The pressure-relief valve has the same func-
tion as a pressure limiter. The latest version 
of the internal pressure-relief valve now has
an integrated limp-home function. The pres-
sure-relief valve limits pressure in the fuel 
rail by releasing a drain hole when pressure
exceeds a certain limit. The limp-home func-
tion ensures that a certain pressure is main-
tained in the fuel rail to permit the  vehicle to
continue running without any  restriction.

Design and operating concept
The pressure-relief valve (Fig. 3) is a mechan-
ical component. It consists of the  following
parts:
(cid:3) A housing with an external thread for

screwing to the fuel rail.

(cid:3) A connection to the fuel-return line 

to the fuel tank (3).
(cid:3) A movable plunger (2).
(cid:3) A plunger return spring (5).

At the end which is screwed to the fuel rail,
there is a hole in the valve housing which 
is sealed by the tapered end of the plunger
resting against the valve seat inside the valve
housing. At normal operating pressure, a
spring presses the plunger against the valve
seat so that the fuel rail remains sealed.  
Only if the pressure rises above the maximum
system pressure is the plunger forced back
against the action of the spring by the pres-
sure in the fuel rail so that the high-pressure
fuel can escape. The fuel is routed through
passages into a central bore of the plunger
and returned to the fuel tank via a common
line. As the valve opens, fuel can escape from
the fuel rail to produce a reduction in fuel-
rail pressure.

Electronic diesel control

System overview

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Electronic control of a diesel engine allows
fuel-injection parameters to be varied pre-
cisely for different conditions. This is the
only means by which a modern diesel engine
is able to satisfy the many demands placed
upon it. The EDC (Electronic Diesel Con-
trol) system is subdivided into three areas,
“Sensors and desired-value generators”,
“Control unit”, and “Actuators”.

System overview

Requirements
Present-day development in the field of
diesel technology is focused on lowering 
fuel consumption and exhaust-gas emissions
(NOx, CO, HC, particulate), while increasing
engine performance and torque. In recent
years this has led to an increase in the popu-
larity of the direct-injection (DI) diesel en-
gine, which uses much higher fuel-injection
pressures than indirect-injection (IDI) en-
gines with whirl or prechamber systems.
Due to the more efficient mixture formation
and the absence of flow-related losses be-
tween the whirl chamber/prechamber and
the main combustion chamber, the fuel
 consumption of direct-injection engines 
is 10 ... 20% lower than that achieved by
 indirect-injection designs.

In addition, diesel engine development has
been influenced by the high levels of com-
fort and convenience demanded in modern
cars. Noise levels, too, are subject to more
and more stringent requirements.

As a result, the performance demanded 
of fuel-injection and engine-management
systems has also increased, specifically with
regard to:
(cid:3) High fuel-injection pressures
(cid:3) Rate-of-discharge curve control
(cid:3) Pre-injection and, where applicable, 

secondary injection

(cid:3) Variation of injected fuel quantity, charge-
air pressure, and start of injection to suit
operating conditions

tity for starting

Electronic diesel control

System overview

455

Conventional mechanical governing of engine
speed uses a number of adjusting mechanisms
to adapt to different engine operating condi-
tions and ensures a high mixture formation
quality. Nevertheless, it is restricted to a sim-
ple engine-based control loop and there are a
number of important influencing variables
that it cannot take account of or cannot re-
spond quickly enough to.

As demands have increased, what was orig-
inally a straightforward system using electric
actuator shafts has developed into the pre-
sent-day EDC, a complex electronic control
system capable of processing large amounts
of data in real time. It can form part of an
overall electronic vehicle control system
(“drive-by-wire”). And a result of the increas-
ing integration of electronic components, the
control-system circuitry can be accommo-
dated in a very small space.

Operating concept
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) is capable of
meeting the requirements listed above as a re-
sult of microcontroller performance that has
risen considerably in the last few years. 

In contrast with diesel-engine vehicles with

conventional mechanically controlled fuel-
injection pumps, the driver of a vehicle
equipped with EDC has no direct control
over the injected fuel quantity via the acceler-
ator pedal and cable. The injected fuel quan-
tity is actually determined by a number of
different influencing variables. They include:
(cid:3) The vehicle response desired by the driver

(accelerator-pedal position)
(cid:3) The engine operating status
(cid:3) The engine temperature
(cid:3) Interventions by other systems (e.g. TCS)
(cid:3) The effect on exhaust-gas emission levels,

etc.

The control unit calculates the injected fuel
quantity on the basis of all these influencing
variables. Start of delivery can also be varied.
This demands a comprehensive monitoring
concept that detects inconsistencies and initi-
ates appropriate actions in accordance with
the effects (e.g. torque limitation or limp-

home mode in the idle-speed range). EDC,
therefore incorporates a number of control
loops.

Electronic diesel control allows data exchange
with other electronic systems, such as the
Traction Control System (TCS), Electronic
Transmission Control (ETC), or Electronic
Stability Program (ESP). As a result, the en-
gine management system can be integrated in
the vehicle’s overall control system network,
thereby enabling functions such as reduction
of engine torque when the automatic trans-
mission changes gear, regulation of engine
torque to compensate for wheel spin, dis-
abling of fuel injection by the engine immo-
bilizer, etc. 

The EDC system is fully integrated in the
vehicle’s diagnostic system. It meets all OBD 
(On-Board Diagnosis) and EOBD (European
OBD) requirements.

System modules
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) is divided
into three system modules (Fig. 1):

1. Sensors and setpoint generators detect
 operating conditions (e.g. engine speed) 
and setpoint values (e.g. switch position).
They convert physical variables into electrical
 signals.

2. The electronic control unit processes data
from the sensors and setpoint generators
based on specific open- and closed-loop con-
trol algorithms. It controls the actuators by
means of electrical output signals. In addi-
tion, the control unit acts as an interface to
other systems and to the vehicle diagnostic
system.

3. Actuators convert electrical output signals
from the control unit into mechanical para-
meters (e.g. the solenoid valve for the fuel-
injection system).

Electronic diesel control

Data processing

The required degree of accuracy together
with the diesel engine’s outstanding dynamic
response requires high-level computing
power. The output signals trigger output
stages that supply sufficient power for the 
actuators (e.g. high-pressure solenoid valves
for the fuel-injection system, exhaust-gas re-
circulation positioners, and boost-pressure
actuators). Apart from this, a number of
other auxiliary-function components
(e.g. glow relay and air-conditioning system)
are triggered.

Faulty signal characteristics are detected by
output-stage diagnostic functions for the
 solenoid valves. Furthermore, signals are
 exchanged with other systems in the vehicle
via the interfaces. The engine ECU monitors
the complete fuel-injection system as part of
a safety strategy.

Data processing

The main function of the electronic diesel
control (EDC) is to control the injected fuel
quantity and the injection timing. The com-
mon-rail fuel-injection system also controls
injection pressure. Furthermore, on all sys-
tems, the engine ECU controls a number 
of actuators. For all components to operate
efficiently, the EDC functions must be pre-
cisely matched to every vehicle and every
 engine. This is the only way to optimize com-
ponent interaction (Fig. 2).

The control unit evaluates the signals sent by
the sensors and limits them to the permitted
voltage level. Some input signals are also
checked for plausibility. Using these input
data together with stored program maps, the
microprocessor calculates injection timing
and its duration. This information is then
converted to a signal characteristic which 
is aligned to the engine’s piston strokes. 
This calculation program is termed the “ECU
software”.

Fuel-injection control

An overview of the various control functions
which are possible with the EDC control
units is given in Table 1. Fig. 1 opposite shows
the sequence of fuel-injection calculations
with all functions, a number of which are
special options. These can be activated in the
ECU by the workshop when retrofit equip-
ment is installed.

In order that the engine can run with optimal
combustion under all operating conditions,
the ECU calculates exactly the right injected
fuel quantity for all conditions. Here, a num-
ber of parameters must be taken into ac-
count. On a number of solenoid-valve-con-
trolled distributor pumps, the sol-enoid
valves for injected fuel quantity and start of
injection are triggered by a separate pump
ECU (PSG).

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Start quantity
For starting, the injected fuel quantity is cal-
culated as a function of coolant temperature
and cranking speed. Start-quantity signals 
are generated from the moment the starting
switch is turned (Fig. 1, switch in “Start” posi-
tion) until a given minimum engine speed is
reached. 

The driver cannot influence the start quan-

tity.

Drive mode
When the vehicle is being driven normally,
the injected fuel quantity is a function of the
accelerator-pedal setting (accelerator-pedal
sensor) and of the engine speed (Fig. 1,
switch in “Drive” position). Calculation
 depends upon maps which also take other 
influences into account (e. g. fuel and intake-
air temperature). This permits best-possible
alignment of the engine’s output to the 
driver’s wishes.

Idle-speed control
The function of idle speed control (LLR) is to
regulate a specific setpoint speed at idle when
the accelerator pedal is not operated. This can
vary depending on the engine’s particular op-
erating mode. For instance, with the engine
cold, the idle speed is usually set higher than
when it is hot. There are further instances
when the idle speed is held somewhat
higher. For instance, when the  vehicle’s electri-
cal-system voltage is too low, when the air-
conditioning system is switched on, or when
the vehicle is freewheeling. When the vehicle 
is driven in stop-and-go traffic, together with
stops at traffic lights, the engine runs a lot of
the time at idle. Considerations concerning
emissions and fuel consumption dictate,
therefore, that idle speed should be kept as
low as possible. This, of course, is a disadvan-
tage with respect to smooth-running and
pulling away.

When adjusting the stipulated idle speed, the
idle-speed control must cope with heavily
fluctuating requirements. The input power
needed by the engine-driven auxiliary equip-
ment varies considerably. 

At low electrical-system voltages, for in-

stance, the alternator consumes far more
power than it does when the voltages are
higher. In addition, the power demands from
the A/C compressor, the steering pump, and
the high-pressure generation for the diesel in-
jection system must all be taken into account.
Added to these external load moments is 
the engine’s internal friction torque which is
highly dependent on engine temperature, 
and must also be compensated for by the
idle-speed control.

In order to regulate the desired idle speed, 
the controller continues to adapt the injected
fuel quantity until the actual engine speed
corresponds to the desired idle speed. 

Maximum-rpm control
The maximum-rpm control ensures that 
the engine does not run at excessive speeds.
To avoid damage to the engine, the engine
manufacturer stipulates a permissible maxi-
mum speed which may only be exceeded for 
a very brief period.

Above the rated-power operating point, 
the maximum-speed governor reduces the 
injected fuel quantity continuously, until 
just above the maximum-speed point when
fuel-injection stops completely. In order 
to prevent engine surge, a ramp function 
is used to ensure that the drop-off in fuel
 injection is not too abrupt. This is all the
more difficult to implement, the closer the
nominal performance point and maximum
engine speed are to each other.

Intermediate-speed control
Intermediate-speed control (ZDR) is used on
commercial vehicles and light-duty trucks
with power take-offs, e.g. crane), or for special
vehicles (e.g. ambulances with a power gener-
ator). With the control in operation, the en-
gine is regulated to a load-independent inter-
mediate speed. 

With the vehicle stationary, the intermedi-
ate-speed control is activated via the cruise-
control operator unit. A fixed rotational
speed can be called up from the data store at
the push of a button. In addition, this opera-
tor unit can be used for preselecting specific
engine speeds. The intermediate-speed con-
trol is also applied on passenger cars with 
automated transmissions (e.g. Tiptronic) to
control the engine speed during gearshifts.

Vehicle-speed controller 
(cruise control)
Cruise control allows the vehicle to be driven
at a constant speed. It controls the vehicle
speed to the speed selected by the driver with-
out him/her needing to press the accelerator
pedal. The driver can set the required speed
either by operating a lever or by pressing but-
tons on the steering wheel. The injected fuel
quantity is either increased or  decreased until
the desired (set) speed is reached. 

On some cruise-control applications, the 
vehicle can be accelerated beyond the current
set speed by pressing the accelerator pedal. 
As soon as the accelerator pedal is  released,
cruise control regulates the speed back down
to the previously set speed.

If the driver depresses the clutch or brake
pedal while cruise control is activated, control
is terminated. On some applications, the con-
trol can be switched off by the accelerator
pedal.

If cruise control has been switched off, the
driver only needs to shift the lever to the
 restore position to reselect the last speed
 setting. 

The operator controls can also be used for a
step-by-step change of the selected speed.

Vehicle-speed limiter
Variable limitation
Vehicle-speed limitation (FGB, also called 
the limiter) limits the maximum speed to 
a set value, even if the driver continues to de-
press the accelerator pedal. On very quiet ve-
hicles, where the engine can hardly be heard,
this is a particular help for the driver who can
no longer exceed speed limits inadvertently.

The vehicle-speed limiter keeps the injected
fuel quantity down to a limit corresponding
to the selected maximum speed. It can be de-
activated by pressing the lever or depressing
the kickdown switch. In order to reselect the
last speed setting, the driver only needs to
press the lever to the restore position. 
The operator controls can also be used for 
a step-by-step change of the selected speed.

Fixed limitation
In a number of countries, fixed maximum
speeds are mandatory for certain classes of
vehicles (for instance, for heavy trucks). 
Vehicle manufacturers also limit the maxi-
mum speeds of their heavy vehicles by in-
stalling a fixed speed limit which cannot be
deactivated.

In the case of special vehicles, the driver 
can also select from a range of fixed, pro-
grammed speed limits (for instance, when
workers are standing on the platform of a
garbage truck).

464

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Active-surge damping
Sudden engine-torque changes excite the ve-
hicle’s drivetrain, which, as a result, goes into
bucking oscillation. These oscillations are
perceived by the vehicle’s occupants as un-
pleasant periodic changes in acceleration
(Fig. 2, a). The function of the active-surge
damper (ARD) is to reduce these changes in
acceleration (b). 
Two different methods are used:
(cid:3) In case of sudden changes in the torque re-
quired by the driver (through the accelera-
tor pedal), a precisely matched filter func-
tion reduces drivetrain excitation (1).
(cid:3) The speed signals are used to detect drive-
train oscillations which are then damped
by an active control. In order to counteract
the drivetrain oscillations (2), the  active
control reduces the injected fuel quantity
when rotational speed increases, and in-
creases it when speed drops. 

Smooth-running control (SRC)/
Control of injected-fuel-quantity
 compensation (MAR)
Presuming a constant injection duration, 
not all of the engine’s cylinders generate the
same torque. This can be due to differences 
in cylinder-head sealing, as well as differences
in cylinder friction, and hydraulic- injection
components. These differences in torque out-
put lead to rough engine running and an in-
crease in exhaust-gas emissions. 

Smooth-running control (LRR) or fuel-
 balancing control (MAR) have the function
of detecting these differences based on the 
resulting fluctuations in engine speed, and 
to compensate by adjusting the injected fuel
quantity in the cylinder affected. Here, the 
rotational speed at a given cylinder after in-
jection is compared to a mean speed. If the
particular cylinder’s speed is too low, the in-
jected fuel quantity is increased; if it is too
high, the fuel quantity is reduced (Fig. 3).

Fuel-injection control

465

Altitude compensation
Atmospheric pressure drops as altitude in-
creases so that the cylinder is charged with less
combustion air. This means that the injected
fuel quantity must be reduced accordingly,
otherwise excessive soot will be emitted. 
In order that the injected fuel quantity can 
be reduced at high altitudes, the atmospheric
pressure is measured by the ambient-pressure
sensor in the ECU. This reduces the injected
fuel quantity at higher elevations. Atmospheric
pressure also has an effect on boost-pressure
control and torque limitation.

Cylinder shutoff
If less torque is required at high engine
speeds, very little fuel needs to be injected. As
an alternative, cylinder shutoff can be  applied
to reduce torque. Here, half of the injectors
are switched off (commercial-vehicle UIS,
UPS, and CRS). The remaining injectors then
inject correspondingly more fuel which can
be metered with even higher precision.

When the injectors are switched on and off,

special software algorithms ensure smooth
transitions without noticeable torque
changes.

Smooth-running control is a convenience fea-
ture. Its primary object is to ensure that the
engine runs smoothly at near-idle. The in-
jected-fuel-quantity compensation function
is aimed at not only improving comfort at
idle, but also at reducing exhaust-gas emis-
sions in the medium-speed ranges by ensur-
ing identical injected fuel quantities for all
cylinders. 

On commercial vehicles, smooth-running
control is also known as the AZG (adaptive
cylinder equalization).

Injected-fuel-quantity limit
There are a number of reasons why the fuel
quantity actually required by the driver, or
that which is physically possible, should not
always be injected. The injection of such fuel
quantities could have the following effects:
(cid:3) Excessive exhaust-gas emissions
(cid:3) Excessive soot
(cid:3) Mechanical overloading due to high torque

or excessive engine speed 

(cid:3) Thermal overloading due to excessive tem-
peratures of the exhaust gas, coolant, oil, or
turbocharger

(cid:3) Thermal overloading of the solenoid valves

if they are triggered too long

To avoid these negative effects, a number 
of input variables (for instance, intake-air
quantity, engine speed, and coolant tempera-
ture) are used to generate this limitation fig-
ure. The result is that the maximum injected
fuel quantity is limited and with it the maxi-
mum torque.

Engine-brake function
When a truck’s engine brake is applied, the
injected fuel quantity is either reduced to
zero, or the idle fuel quantity is injected. For
this purpose, the ECU detects the position of
the engine-brake switch.

466

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Injector delivery compensation
New functions are added to common-rail
(CR) and UIS/UPS systems to enhance the
high precision of the fuel-injection system
further, and ensure them for the service life of
the vehicle.

With injector delivery compensation

(IMA), a mass of measuring data is detected
for each injector during the injector manu-
facturing process. The data is then affixed 
to the injector in the form of a data-matrix
code. With piezo-inline injectors, data on lift
response is included. This data is transferred
to the ECU during vehicle production. While
the engine is running, these values are used to
compensate for deviations in metering and
switching response.

Zero delivery calibration
The reliable mastery of small pre-injection
events for the service life of the vehicle is
 vitally important to achieve the required level
of comfort (through reduced noise) and ex-
haust-gas emission targets. There must be
some form of compensation for fuel-quantity
drifts in the injectors. For this  reason, a small
quantity of fuel is injected in one cylinder in
overrun conditions in  second- and third-
generation CR systems. 
The wheel-speed sensor detects the resulting
torque increase as a minor dynamic change 
in engine speed. This increase in torque,
which remains imperceptible to the driver, 
is clearly linked to the injected fuel quantity.
The process is then repeated for all cylinders
and at various operating points. A teach-in
algorithm detects minor changes in pre-
 injection quantity and corrects the injector
triggering period accordingly for all pre-
 injection events.

Average delivery adaption
The deviation of the actually injected fuel
quantity from the setpoint value is required
to adapt exhaust-gas recirculation and
charge-air pressure correctly. The average de-
livery adaption (MMA), therefore determines
the average value of the injected fuel quantity
for all cylinders from the signals received
from the lambda oxygen sensor and the air-
mass sensor. Correction values are then calcu-
lated from the setpoint and actual values (see
“Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-
car diesel engines”). 

The MMA teach-in function ensures a con-

stant level of favorable exhaust-gas emission
values in the lower part-load range for the
service life of the vehicle.

Pressure-wave correction
Injection events trigger pressure waves in the
line between the nozzle and the fuel rail in all
CR systems. These pressure pulses affect sys-
tematically the injected fuel quantity of later
injection events (pre-injection/main injec-
tion/secondary injection) within a combus-
tion cycle. The deviations of later  injection
events are dependent on the fuel quantity
previously injected, the time interval between
injection events, rail pressure, and fuel tem-
perature. The control unit can calculate a 
correction factor by including these parame-
ters in suitable compensation algorithms.
However, extremely high application re-
sources are required for this correction func-
tion. The benefit is the possibility of flexibly
adjusting the interval between pre-injection
and main injection, for example, in order to
optimize combustion.

Injector delivery compensation

Functional description 
Injector delivery compensation (IMA) is a soft-
ware function to make fuel quantity metering
more precise and increase injector efficiency
on the engine. The feature has the function of
correcting injected fuel quantity to the setpoint
value over the entire program map individually
for every injector in a CR system. This re-
duces system tolerances and exhaust-gas
emission spread. The compensation values
 required for IMA represent the difference from
the setpoint value of each factory test point,
and are inscribed on each injector in encoded
form. 

by means of a correction program map that
uses compensation values to calculate a cor-
rection quantity. At the end of the line of the
car assembly plant, the EDC compensation
values belonging to the injectors fitted and
their cylinder assignment are programmed in
the electronic control unit using EOL program-
ming. The compensation values are also re-
programmed when an injector is replaced at
the customer service workshop.

Necessity for this function
The technical resources required for a further
restriction of the manufacturing tolerances for
injectors rise exponentially and appear to be
 financially unprofitable. IMA is a viable solution
to increase efficiency, enhance the metering
precision of fuel quantity injected in the en-
gine, and reduce exhaust-gas emissions.

Measured values in testing
The end-of-line test measures every injector at
several points that are representative for the
spread of the particular injector type. Devia-
tions from setpoint values at these points
(compensation values) are calculated and
then inscribed on the injector head.

Electronic diesel control

Lambda closed-loop control

Lambda closed-loop control
for passenger-car diesel
 engines
Application
The lawmakers are continually increasing the
severity of legislation governing exhaust-gas
emission limits for cars powered by diesel 
engines. Apart from the measures taken to 
optimize the engine’s internal combustion, 
the open and closed-loop control of functions
related to exhaust-gas emissions are continu-
ing to gain in importance. Introduction of
lambda closed-loop control offers major 
potential for reducing emission-value spread
in diesel engines.

A broadband lambda oxygen sensor in the 
exhaust pipe (Fig. 1, 7) measures the residual
oxygen content in the exhaust gas. 
This is an indicator of the A/F ratio (excess-
air-factor lambda λ). The lambda oxygen-
sensor signal is adapted while the engine is
running. This ensures a high level of signal
accuracy throughout the sensor’s service life.
The lambda oxygen-sensor signal is used as
the basis for a number of lambda functions,
which will be described in more detail in the
following.

Lambda closed-loop control circuits are used
to regenerate NOX accumulator-type catalytic
converters.

Lambda closed-loop control

469

Lambda closed-loop control is designed for
all passenger-car fuel-injection systems with
engine control units dating dating from the
EDC16 generation.

Basic functions
Pressure compensation
The unprocessed lambda oxygen-sensor
 signal is dependent on the oxygen concentra-
tion in the exhaust gas and the exhaust-gas
pressure at the sensor installation point. The
influence of pressure on the sensor  signal
must, therefore, be compensated.

The pressure-compensation function incorpo-
rates two program maps, one for exhaust-gas
pressure, and one for pressure dependence of
the lambda oxygen-sensor output signal.
These two maps are used to correct the sensor
output signal with reference to the particular
operating point.

Adaption
In overrun mode (trailing throttle), lambda
oxygen-sensor adaption takes into account
the deviation of the measured oxygen con-
centration from the fresh-air oxygen concen-
tration (approx. 21%). As a result, the system
“learns” a correction value which is used at
every engine operating point to correct the
measured oxygen concentration. This leads 
to a precise, drift-compensated lambda out-
put signal for the service life of the lambda
oxygen sensor.

Lambda-based EGR control
Compared with air-mass-based exhaust-gas
recirculation, detecting oxygen concentration
in the exhaust gas allows tighter emission 
tolerance bands for an automotive manufac-
turer’s entire vehicle fleet. For  future limits,
an emission advantage of  approx. 10 to 20%
can be gained in this way for the exhaust-gas
test.

Lambda closed-loop control

Average delivery adaption
Average delivery adaption supplies a precise
injection quantity signal to form the setpoint
for the exhaust-gas-related closed  control
loop. Correction of exhaust-gas  recirculation
plays a major role in emissions here. Average
delivery adaption operates in the lower part-
load range and determines the average devia-
tion in the injected fuel quantity of all cylin-
ders.

Fig. 2 (previous page) shows the basic struc-
ture of average delivery adaption and its in-
fluence on the exhaust-gas-related closed
control loops.

The lambda oxygen-sensor signal and the air-
mass signal are used to calculate the  actually
injected fuel mass, which is then compared to
the desired injected fuel mass. Differences are
stored in an adaption map in defined “learn-
ing points”. This procedure ensures that,
when the operating point  requires an injected

fuel quantity correction, it can be imple-
mented without delay even during dynamic
changes of state.

These correction quantities are stored in 
the EEPROM of the ECU and are available
immediately the engine is started.

Basically speaking, there are two average-
 delivery adaption operating modes. They dif-
fer in the way they apply detected deviations
in injected fuel quantity:

Operating mode: Indirect Control
In Indirect Control mode (Fig. 2), a precise in-
jection quantity setpoint is used as the input
variable in various exhaust-gas-related refer-
ence program maps. The injected fuel quan-
tity is not corrected during the fuel-metering
process.

Operating mode: Direct Control
In Direct Control mode, the quantity devia-
tion is used in the metering process to correct
the injected fuel quantity so that the  actual
fuel quantity injected coincides more pre-
cisely with the reference injected fuel quan-
tity. In this case, this is (more or less) 
a closed quantity control loop.

Full-load smoke limitation
Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the control
structure for full-load smoke limitation using
a lambda oxygen sensor. The objective here 
is to determine the maximum fuel quantity
which may be injected without  exceeding a
given smoke-emission value.

The signals from the air-mass meter and 
the engine-speed sensor are applied together
with a smoke-limitation map to determine the
desired air/fuel ratio value λdesired. This, in
turn, is applied together with the air mass to
calculate the precontrol value for the maxi-
mum permissible injected fuel quantity.

This form of control is already in serial pro-
duction, and has a lambda closed-loop control
imposed on it. The lambda controller calcu-
lates a correction fuel quantity from the dif-
ference between the desired air/fuel ratio λde-
sired and the actual air/fuel ratio value 
λactual. The maximum full-load injected fuel
quantity is the total of the pilot-control quan-
tity and the correction quantity.

This control architecture permits a high level
of dynamic response due to pilot  control, and
improved precision due to the  superimposed
lambda control loop.

Detection of undesirable combustion
The lambda oxygen sensor signal helps to 
detect the occurrence of undesirable combus-
tion in overrun mode. It is detected if the
lambda oxygen-sensor signal drops below a
calculated threshold. In this case, the engine
can be switched off by closing a control flap
and the EGR valve. The detection of undesir-
able combustion represents an additional 
engine safeguard function.

Summary
A lambda-based exhaust-gas recirculation
system can substantially reduce emission-
value spread over a manufacturer’s vehicle
fleet due to production tolerances or aging
drift. This is achieved by using average 
delivery adaption.

Average delivery adaption supplies a precise
injection quantity signal to form the setpoint
for the exhaust-gas-related closed control
loop. The precision of these control loops is
increased as a result. Correction of exhaust-
gas recirculation plays the major role on emis-
sions here.

In addition, the application of lambda closed-
loop control permits the precise  metering of
the full-load smoke quantity and detection 
of undesirable combustion in overrun (trail-
ing throttle) mode.

Furthermore, the lambda oxygen sensor’s
high-precision signal can be used in a 
lambda closed control loop to regenerate
NOX catalytic converters.

Closed-loop and open-loop control

(cid:2)

Closed-loop and open-loop control

Application
The closed-loop and open-loop control appli-
cations are of vital importance for various 
on-board systems. 

The term (open-loop) control is used in
many cases, not only for the process of con-
trolling, but also for the entire system in which
control takes place (for this reason, the gen-
eral term “control unit” is used, although it
may perform a closed-loop control function).
Accordingly, arithmetic processes run in con-
trol units to calculate both closed-loop and
open-loop functions. 

Closed-loop control
Closed-loop control is a process in which a
parameter (controlled variable x) is detected
continuously, compared to another parameter
(reference variable w1), and adapted to the
 reference variable in an adjustment process
depending on the result of the comparison.
The resulting action takes place in a closed
circuit (closed control loop).

Closed-loop control has the function of
 adjusting the value of controlled variables to a
value specified by a reference variable, despite
any disturbance influences that may occur. 
The closed control loop (Fig. 1a) is a

closed-loop control circuit with a discrete ac-
tion. Controlled variable x acts within a loop
configuration in a form of negative feedback.
Contrary to open-loop control, closed-loop
control considers the impact of all disturbance

values (z1, z2) occurring within the control
loop. Examples of closed-loop systems in a
vehicle:
(cid:3) Lambda closed-loop control
(cid:3) Idle-speed control
(cid:3) ABS/TSC/ESP control
(cid:3) Air conditioning (interior temperature)

Open-loop control
Open-loop control is the process within a sys-
tem in which one or several parameters act as
input variables affecting other parameters due
to intrinsic laws governing the system. A fea-
ture of open-loop control is the open action
sequence across an individual transfer ele-
ment or the open control loop.

An open control loop (Fig. 1b) is an

arrangement of elements that interact on each
other in a loop structure. It may interact in any
possible way with other systems as an entity
within a higher-level system. The open control
loop can only counter the impact of a distur-
bance value measured by the control unit
(e.g. z1); other disturbance values (e.g. z2) 
may act unimpaired. Examples of open-loop
systems in a vehicle:

Torque-controlled 
EDC systems

The engine-management system is continu-
ally being integrated more closely into the
overall vehicle system. Through the CAN bus,
vehicle dynamics systems such as TCS, and
comfort and convenience systems such as
cruise control, have a direct influence on the
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC). Apart from
this, much of the information registered
and/or calculated in or by the engine man-
agement system must be passed on to other
ECUs through the CAN bus.

In order to be able to incorporate the EDC
even more efficiently in a functional alliance
with other ECUs, and implement other
changes rapidly and effectively, it was neces-
sary to make far-reaching changes to the
newest-generation controls. These changes 
resulted in the torque-controlled EDC which
was introduced with the EDC16.  The main
feature is the changeover of the module
 interfaces to the parameters, as commonly 
encountered in practice in the vehicle.

Engine parameters
Essentially, an IC engine’s output can be de-
fined using the three parameters: power P,
engine speed n, and torque M. 

For 2 diesel engines. Fig. 1 compares typical

curves of torque and power as a function of
engine speed. Basically speaking, the follow-
ing equation applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

In other words, it suffices to use the torque as
the reference (command) variable. Engine
power then results from the above equation.
Since power output cannot be measured di-
rectly, torque has turned out to be a suitable
reference (command) variable for engine
management.

Torque control
When accelerating, the driver uses the accel-
erator pedal (sensor) to directly demand a

given torque from the engine. At the same
time, but independent of the driver’s require-
ments, via the interfaces other vehicle systems
submit torque demands resulting from the
power requirements of the particular compo-
nent (e.g. air conditioner, alternator). Using
these torque-requirement inputs, the engine
management calculates the output torque to
be generated by the engine and controls the
fuel-injection and air-system actuators ac-
cordingly. This method has the following 
advantages:
(cid:3) No single system (for instance, boost pres-
sure, fuel injection, pre-glow) has a direct
effect on engine management. This enables
the engine management to also take into
account higher-level optimization criteria
(such as exhaust-gas emissions and fuel
consumption) when processing external 
requirements, and thus control the  engine
in the most efficient manner,

(cid:3) Many of the functions which do not di-
rectly concern the engine management 
can be designed to function identically 
for diesel and gasoline engines.

(cid:3) Extensions to the system can be imple-

mented quickly.

Electronic diesel control 

Torque-controlled EDC systems

Internal torque demands
At this stage, the idle-speed control and the
active surge damper intervene.

For instance, if demanded by the situation,

in order to prevent mechanical damage, or
excessive smoke due to the injection of too
much fuel, the torque limitation  reduces the
internal torque requirement. 
In contrast to the previous engine-manage-
ment systems, limitations are no longer only
applied to the injected fuel-quantity, but in-
stead, depending upon the required effects,
also to the particular physical quantity in-
volved.

The engine’s losses are also taken into

 account (e.g. friction, drive for the high-pres-
sure pump). The torque represents the en-
gine’s measurable effects to the outside. The
engine management, though, can only gener-
ate these effects in conjunction with the cor-
rect fuel injection together with the correct
injection point, and the necessary marginal
conditions as apply to the air-intake system
(e.g. boost pressure and EGR rate). The re-
quired injected fuel quantity is determined
using the current combustion efficiency. The
calculated fuel quantity is limited by a protec-
tive function (for instance, protection against
overheating), 
and if necessary can be varied by smooth-
running control (SRC). During engine start,
the injected fuel quantity is not determined
by external inputs such as those from the dri-
ver, but rather by the separate “start-quantity
control” function.

Actuator triggering
Finally, the desired values for the injected fuel
quantity are used to generate the triggering
data for the injection pump and/or the injec-
tors, and for defining the optimum operating
point for the intake-air system.

Engine-management sequence
Fig. 2 shows (schematically) the processing of
the setpoint inputs in the engine ECU. In or-
der to be able to fulfill their assignments effi-
ciently, the engine management’s control
functions all require a wide range of sensor
signals and information from other ECUs in
the vehicle.

Propulsion torque
The driver’s input (that is, the signal from 
the accelerator-pedal sensor) is interpreted 
by the engine management as the request 
for a propulsive torque. The inputs from the
cruise control and the vehicle speed limiter
are processed in exactly the same manner. 
Following this selection of the desired
propulsive torque, should the situation arise,
the vehicle-dynamics system (TCS, ESP) in-
creases the desired torque value when there is
the danger of wheel lockup and decreases it
when the wheels show a tendency to spin.

Further external torque demands
The drivetrain’s torque adaptation must be
taken into account (drivetrain transmission
ratio). This is defined for the most part by the
ratio of the particular gear, or by the torque-
converter efficiency in the case of automatic
transmissions. On vehicles with an automatic-
gearbox, the transmission control stipulates
the torque requirement during the actual gear
shift. Apart from reducing the load on the
transmission, reduced torque at this point re-
sults in a comfortable, smooth gear shift. In
addition, the torque required by other engine-
powered units (for instance, air-conditioner
compressor, alternator, servo pump) is deter-
mined. This torque requirement is calculated
either by the units themselves or by the engine
management.

Calculation is based on unit power and ro-

tational speed, and the engine management
adds up the various torque requirements. The
vehicle’s drivability remains  unchanged de-
spite varying requirements from the auxiliary
units and changes in the engine’s operating
state.

Fuel-consumption signal 
The engine ECU (Fig. 1, 3) determines fuel
consumption and sends this signal via CAN
to the instrument cluster or a separate on-
board computer (6), where the driver is in-
formed of current fuel consumption and/or
the range that can be covered with the re-
maining fuel in the tank. Older systems 
used pulse-width modulation (PWM) for 
the fuel-consumption signal.

Starter control
The starter motor (8) can be triggered from
the engine ECU. This ensures that the driver
cannot operate the starter motor with the 
engine already running. The starter motor
only turns long enough to allow the engine 
to reach a self-sustaining speed reliably. 
This function leads to a lighter, and thus
lower-priced, starter motor.

Glow control unit
The glow control unit (GZS, 5) receives infor-
mation from the engine ECU to control glow
start and duration. It then triggers the glow
plugs accordingly and monitors the glow
process, and reports back to the engine ECU
on any faults (diagnostic function). The pre-
glow indicator lamp is usually  triggered from
the engine ECU.

Electronic immobilizer
To prevent unauthorized starting and drive-
off, the engine cannot be started before a spe-
cial immobilizer (7) ECU removes the block
from the engine ECU. 

The driver can signal the immobilizer ECU

that he/she is authorized to use the  vehicle,
either by remote control or by means of the
glow-plug and starter switch (“Ignition” key).
The immobilizer ECU then removes the
block on the engine ECU to  allow engine 
start and normal operation.

External torque intervention
In the case of external torque intervention,
the injected fuel quantity is influenced by an-
other (external) ECU (for instance, for trans-
mission-shift control, or TCS). This informs
the engine ECU whether the engine torque is
to be changed, and if so, by how much (this
defines the injected fuel quantity).

Alternator control
By means of a standard serial interface, the
EDC can control and monitor the alternator
(9) remotely. The regulator voltage can be
controlled, just the same as the complete
 alternator assembly can be switched off. In
case of low battery power, for instance, the al-
ternator’s charging curve can be improved by
increasing the idle speed. It is also possible to
perform simple alternator diagnosis through
this interface.

Air conditioner
In order to maintain comfortable tempera-
tures inside the vehicle when the ambient
temperature is high, the air conditioner (A/C)
cools down cabin air with the help of an 
A/C compressor (10). Depending on the 
engine and operating conditions, the A/C
compressor may draw as much as 30% of the
engine’s output power.

Immediately the driver hits the accelerator
pedal (in other words he/she wishes maxi-
mum torque), the compressor can be
switched off briefly by the engine ECU 
to concentrate all of the engine’s power to 
the wheels. Since the compressor is only
switched off very briefly, this has no notice-
able effect on interior temperature.

Serial data transmission
(CAN)

Modern-day vehicles are equipped with a
constantly increasing number of electronic
systems. Along with their need for extensive
exchange of data and information in order 
to operate efficiently, the data volumes and
speeds are also increasing at a rapid rate.

Although CAN (Controller Area Network) 
is a linear bus system (Fig. 1) specifically
 designed for automotive applications, it has
already been introduced in other sectors 
(for instance, in building automation).

Data is relayed in serial form, that is, one

after another on a common bus line. All 
CAN stations have access to this bus, and 
via a CAN interface in the ECUs, they can 
receive and transmit data over the CAN bus
line. Since a considerable amount of data can
be exchanged and repeatedly accessed on a
single bus line, this network results in far
fewer lines required. On conventional sys-
tems, data exchange takes place point to point
over individually assigned data lines.

Active steering

Purpose, design

Active steering

The development of vehicle steering sys-
tems is characterized by the consistent
 introduction of hydraulic servo assist and
the replacement of ball-and-nut-type steer-
ing in the car by the easier and more inex-
pensive rack-and-pinion steering. Recently,
electromechanical power steering has been
displacing hydraulic power steering in small
and lightweight cars. By law, however, pure
“steer-by-wire” technology is not yet per-
mitted in motor vehicles. European Union
safety regulations still require a mechanical
connection between the steering wheel and
the wheels of the vehicle.

All of these developments have the goal of
making vehicle handling as easy as possible
and to limit steering forces to a logical
amount. The best possible feedback about
the contact of the tires to the road is to be
ensured. This has a decisive impact on the
driver’s ability to manage his or her task in
the control loop between driver, vehicle and
environment.

Purpose

The newly developed active steering can
 affect the steering forces and the steering
 angle set by the driver. It fulfills the wish for
a direct steering ratio to improve handling at
low speeds. It also meets requirements for
ensuring comfort, drivability and straight-
running stability at high speeds. Active steer-
ing is an initial step towards a “steer-by-
wire” function. Although it does not let the
car drive itself, it provides correction func-
tions and added comfort and convenience.

Design

The primary difference between active steer-
ing and a “steer-by-wire” system is the fact
that the steering train, and thus the driver’s
mechanical control of the steered front
wheels, is maintained during active steering.

Active steering

Purpose, design

479

Mechanical system
The steering train consists, as usual, of the
steering wheel, steering column, steering
gear and tie rods. The special feature of the
new active steering is a differential gearbox
(Fig. 2). For this purpose, a planetary gear
(6) is integrated with two input shafts and
one output shaft in the steering gear. One
input shaft is connected to the steering
wheel, and the other drives an electric motor
(4) via a worm gear pair (3) as a reduction
stage. The connected ECU processes the
necessary sensor signals, controls the electric
motor and monitors the entire steering
 system. 

The electric motor and differential gearbox
allow steering intervention at the front axle
to take place independently of the driver. 
At low speeds, the effective steering angle 
at the wheels is greater than the angle set
on the steering wheel, as the system adds a
part that is proportional to the steering 
angle. At high speeds, it subtracts a corre-
sponding amount so that the wheel angle is

smaller than that set by the driver (Fig. 1).
When the electric motor is inactive, the
steering wheel controls the vehicle’s wheels
directly, as with conventional steering
 systems.

Hydraulic system
The principle of differential steering usually
requires a hydraulic servo assist to limit the
forces applied by hand to a logical amount.
This is accomplished using an “open center”
steering valve specially adapted to the high
performance requirements. The vector su-
perimposition of the positioning rates of the
drivers and engine can, in certain cases,
cause significantly higher rack-and-pinion
speeds than those of conventional steering
systems. The geometric flow of the vane-
type power steering pump with flow rate
controller is designed for the theoretical
maximum positioning rate. Regulation at
the output side provides a highly dynamic
and quiet energy supply for the active
 steering system.

Active steering

Method of operation

Method of operation

Activation concept
The actuator adjustment at the front axle,
which takes place independently of the dri-
ver, requires a complex activation concept
that is implemented in an ECU with two
processors that communicate with each
other. One processor is responsible for acti-
vating the servomotor, the other for calcu-
lating the correct control angle. Both proces-
sors monitor each other to ensure that they
are functioning properly. The movement
status of the steering gear is detected using
one angle sensor each on the steering pinion
and servomotor. The steering wheel angle
signal is also used as the setpoint specifica-
tion from the driver. Sensors for yaw veloc-
ity, lateral acceleration and wheel speed,
which are already in place for the driving
stability systems (ESP), provide additional
input signals for the active steering. 

The ECU is networked to the system using

powertrain CAN and the new chassis CAN
at the required high data rate (see Fig. 3).
Approximately 100 times a second, the nec-
essary data are collected using sensors and
evaluated by the ECU. The ECU then de-
cides whether, and by what amount, the
steering angle needs to be changed. At low
speeds, it adds an amount proportional to
the steering angle; at high speeds, it sub-

tracts a corresponding amount. Therefore,
from the driver’s point of view, the impres-
sion given is of a steering ratio that is vari-
able over the driving speed. The steering 
effort remains largely constant over a wide
speed range. Except at extremely low speeds,
a significantly greater steering angle than
180° is required.

Driving stabilization 
To calculate the stabilizing steering interven-
tion, the vehicle movement variables of yaw
angular acceleration and lateral acceleration
are returned and compared in the stabiliza-
tion controller with the setpoint specified by
the driver, which is made up of the steering
wheel angle and driving speed (Fig. 4).

Setpoint value
The setpoint for the control angle to be set,
which is calculated in the ECU of the active
steering, can be separated into a part with
open-loop control and a part with closed-
loop control. The open-loop control part,
known simply as the variable steering ratio,
by definition is calculated from the reference
variable only, the driver’s steering angle.
 Additional information from the closed-
loop control system known as the “vehicle”
provides the basis for the closed-loop part.
The partial setpoints meet at a convergence
point. They modify the response of the vehi-

cle closed-loop con-
trol system to the dri-
ver’s steering input.
These steering inter-
ventions are usually
continuous and thus
do not disturb the
driver.

 comparable to familiar, manageable distur-
bances such as those caused by crosswinds
or rail grooves in the road.

Active steering requires no additional con-
trol elements because all of its subfunctions
are activated automatically when the engine
is started. If the internal combustion engine
is not working (while the vehicle is being
towed), the active steering, like conventional
power steering, is disabled. Such situations
are indicated by a lamp in the instrument
cluster.

Benefits of active steering
for the driver
(cid:3) Driving errors are corrected or compen-
sated for in such a way that the driver is
not surprised by the vehicle’s reaction.
(cid:3) The steering ratio, which depends on the
driving situation, makes it easier to ma-
neuver the car at very low speeds, as fewer
complete turns of the steering wheel are
required with the same amount of effort. 
(cid:3) Greater convenience and comfort at high
speeds, as the driver no longer needs to
fear losing control of the car by acciden-
tally applying too much steering force.
(cid:3) The steering lead is another comfort and
convenience feature. It allows more agile
activation in response to the steering
command.

Cooperation with driving stability systems
Compared to conventional driving stability
systems based on wheel slip control, driving
stabilization via steering intervention at the
front axle has different characteristics:
(cid:3) The steering intervention is considerably
less noticeable to the driver than the
clearly audible braking intervention.
(cid:3) The steering intervention is faster than a
radial braking intervention, which re-
quires a certain pressure build-up time.

(cid:3) The braking intervention provides
 superior stabilization performance
than the steering.

By combining active steering (steering inter-
vention) and wheel slip control (braking in-
tervention), optimum driving stabilization is
attained. 

Safety concept

If the servomotor has to be switched off due
to a fault, this path is mechanically blocked.
The planetary gear then rolls off internally
while the worm gear is blocked, and the ve-
hicle remains steerable with no restrictions
and at a constant gear ratio. Thus active
steering is possible even if the mechanical
connection fails. This is a great advantage
over pure “steer-by-wire” systems. In active
steering, all relevant input signals are safe-
guarded by redundant sensors or measure-
ments. Two different processors calculate the
setpoint signal in the ECU. Although the
conversion of the setpoint signal in the
electromechanical converter takes place in
one channel only, no unwanted actuation in
the region relevant to vehicle dynamics is
possible due to the selection of a BLDC
 motor. 

The safety concept is expanded by adding an
adapted shutoff concept. Function shutoffs
range from temporary or long-term dis-
abling of the driving stabilization to limited
vehicle operation with substitute values all
the way to complete shutoff of the entire
system. The state transitions here are

Power windows

Drive and adjustment systems

Power windows

Application
Power windows have mechanisms that are
driven by electric motors. There are two
types of systems in use (Fig. 1). The available
installation space assumes a prominent place
among the criteria applied in determining
which system to install.
(cid:3) Rod linkage regulator mechanism: The

drive motor pinion engages with a quad-
rant gear, which is connected to a rod
linkage. The use of this type of window
regulator mechanism is decreasing.

(cid:3) Flexible cable mechanism: The drive motor
turns a cable reel, which operates a flexi-
ble cable mechanism.

Power window motors
Space limitations inside the door make
 narrow drive units imperative (flat motors,
Fig. 2). The reduction gearing is a self-in-
hibiting worm gear design. This prevents the
window from opening inadvertently of its
own accord or being opened by force.

Dampers integrated in the gearing mecha-

nism provide good damping characteristics
at the end positions.

Power window control
The window is controlled manually by
means of a rocker switch. For greater conve-
nience, power windows can be linked to a
central or decentralized closing system
which, when the vehicle is locked, closes the
windows automatically or sets them to a
predefined partially open position for venti-
lation purposes.

When the windows are closed, a force
limitation device comes into effect. The
 device serves to prevent human limbs
from being caught by the closing window.
In Germany, paragraph  30 of the StVZO
(Road Traffic Licensing Regulations) stipu-
lates that the force limitation device must
be effective when the window is moving
upwards within a range of 200 to 4 mm
from the upper edge of the window
 aperture.

The power window drive units include inte-

speed during operation. If a reduction in
speed is detected, the motor’s direction of ro-
tation is immediately reversed. The window

spring rate of 10 N/mm. The unit automati-
cally overrides the force limitation function

position and permitting complete closure of
the window. The window position is moni-
tored over its entire range of movement.

Electronic control (Fig. 3) may be concen-
trated in a central control unit, or the con-
trol elements may be dispersed among the
individual power window motors in order to
reduce the complexity of the wiring. Future
decentralized electronics will be networked
via bus interfaces (LIN bus/CAN bus). The
advantages offered are fault diagnosis for the
electronics and further reduction of the
amount of wiring.

the use of special control systems that
may be electronic or electromechanical in
design. 

Open-loop control
With electromechanical control (Fig. 4),
 mechanical interlocks on limit switches a)
and b) ensure that the roof can either slide
or tilt open from the closed position, de-
pending on the polarity applied to Terminals
1 and 2. Once the sunroof has been tilted or
opened, a polarity changeover will initiate
the lowering or closing process. An elec-
tronic control unit featuring integral force
limitation allows the sliding/tilting sunroof
to be incorporated in a central locking sys-
tem. The electronic control system includes
a microcomputer responsible for evaluating
incoming signals and monitoring sliding
sunroof position. The closed and end posi-
tions for the sliding action of the sunroof
are monitored with the aid of microswitches
or Hall-effect sensors. Possible auxiliary
functions include: 
(cid:3) Preset position control
(cid:3) Closing via rain sensor
(cid:3) Motor speed control
(cid:3) Electronic motor protection

cables or other torsion and pressure-resis-
tant control cables. The drive motor is usu-
ally installed in the roof or at the rear of 
the vehicle (e.g. in the trunk). Permanently
energized worm drive motors with outputs
of approximately 30 W are used as the drive
motors. They are protected against thermal
overload by a thermostatic switch (phasing
out) or (most frequently) by a software 
thermal protection switch.

Provision must also be made for ensuring
that the roof can be closed using simple on-
board tools (such as a crank) if the electrical
system fails.

Drive and adjustment systems

Seat and steering column adjustment

Seat and steering column
adjustment

Application
Electric power seats (Fig. 1) are still primar-
ily installed in passenger cars in the mid-
price and high-price ranges. The primary
function of these systems is to enhance com-
fort, but multiple adjustment options com-
bined with space restrictions and difficult
access to the controls limit the practicality of
manually operated mechanisms. Up to seven
motors control the following functions:
(cid:3) Seat cushion height adjustment, front/rear
(cid:3) Fore/aft seat adjustment
(cid:3) Seat cushion depth adjustment
(cid:3) Backrest tilt adjustment
(cid:3) Lumbar support adjustment, height/

(cid:3) Shoulder support tilt angle (top third of

curvature

backrest)

(cid:3) Head restraint height adjustment

Adjustment systems
A common seat bottom frame includes four
motors, which drive the height adjustment
gearing or the combined fore/aft and height
adjustment gearing. The unit for adjusting the
seat height is not included on simpler seat de-
signs. Another concept features three identical
motor-and-gear assemblies with four height
and two fore/aft adjustment gear sets. The
motor-and-gear assemblies drive the gear sets
via flexible shafts. This is a highly universal
system and can be installed on any seat design.
Modern seats (especially for sportscars)
do not merely fasten the lap belt to the seat
frame, they also attach the shoulder strap,
including its height adjustment, inertia reel
and seat belt pretensioner mechanism, to the
backrest. This type of seat design ensures
optimized seat belt positioning for a wide
range of different occupant sizes at all avail-
able seat positions, and makes an important
contribution to occupant safety. The seat
frame must be reinforced for this type of 
design, while both the gear set components
and their connections to the frame must be
strengthened.

The optional programmable electric seat ad-
justment (“memory seat”) can recall several
preset seat positions. Potentiometers or Hall-
effect sensors provide seat position feedback.
On two-door vehicles, a feature designed to
slide the front seat to its extreme forward
 position can be incorporated to help rear
passengers enter the vehicle.

Electrically adjustable steering columns
are also on the increase as another means of
enhancing driver comfort. The adjustment
mechanism, consisting of a single electric
motor and self-inhibiting gear set for each
adjustment plane, forms an integral part of
the steering column. The gear set for fore/aft
adjustment must be capable of absorbing all
impact forces (crash forces) that might be
applied to the steering column. The adjust-
ment can be triggered in either of two ways,
by the manual position switch or by the pro-
grammable seat adjustment. The column
can also be tilted upward when the ignition
is switched off to help the driver enter or
exit the vehicle.

Electronic heater control, electrically controlled air conditioning system

Heating, ventilation and air conditioning 

The vehicle’s heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems have the following
tasks:
(cid:3) Providing a pleasant climate for all

 occupants of the car at different outside
temperatures (Fig. 1).

(cid:3) Ensuring good visibility through all

 windows and the windshield.

(cid:3) Creating an environment calculated to
minimize driver stress and fatigue.
(cid:3) More recent units use filters to remove

particulate matter (pollen, dust) and even
odors from the air.

Electronic heater control

Function
In many countries, the performance of the
heater unit is governed by legal require-
ments, with emphasis on the defroster’s
 ability to maintain clear windows and wind-
shields (such as EEC Directive 78/317 within
the European Union, and MVSS 103 in the
USA).

Method of operation
Variations in outside air temperature and
vehicle speed cause fluctuations in the tem-
perature of the passenger compartment.
Without a control system, the heater con-
trols must be constantly readjusted by hand

in order to maintain an agreeable tempera-
ture. Electronic heater control dispenses
with this requirement by automatically
maintaining the interior temperature of the
vehicle at the desired level.

With heater units featuring water-side
control, sensors monitor the temperatures of
the vehicle’s interior and of the emerging air.
The control unit processes this information
and compares it with the preselected temper-
ature. Meanwhile, a solenoid valve installed
in the cooling circuit opens and closes at a
given frequency in response to the signals
which it receives from the control unit. Ad-
justments in open/close ratio in the cycle pe-
riods regulate the flow rate from the closed
position up to the maximum.

An adjustment flap, actuated by an elec-
tric gearmotor, is the usual means of provid-
ing infinitely variable temperature control in
air-side systems (pneumatic linear adjusters
are also occasionally used). Sophisticated
systems allowing separate adjustment for the
left and right sides of the vehicle are also
available.

Electronically controlled 
air conditioning system

Function
The heater unit alone is not capable of
 providing a comfortable environment at
all times. When outside temperatures
exceed 20°C, the required inside tempera-
tures can be attained only by cooling the air
using compressor refrigeration systems and
the refrigerant R 134 (Fig. 2, next page). The
moisture contained in the cooled air is also
extracted as condensate, thus reducing the
air’s humidity to the desired level.

Automatic climate control is particularly
useful for vehicles in which both air condi-
tioner and heater are installed, because the
constant monitoring and adjustment re-
quired to maintain a temperate climate pre-
sents the occupants with a complicated task.
This rule applies to bus drivers in particular,
as they can only feel the temperature at the
front of the vehicle.

Heating, ventilation and air conditioning

Electronically controlled air conditioning system

The task of automatic climate control sys-
tems incorporating a preselection feature is
to automatically maintain the correct tem-
perature, air flow, and air distribution in the
passenger compartment. These parameters
are mutually interdependent, and changes to
one will affect the others.

Method of operation
The compressor, powered by the motor
(Fig. 2, Item 1) compresses and heats the
gaseous coolant. It then cools in the con-
denser (3) and becomes a liquid. The gener-
ated heat dissipates into the environment.
An expansion valve (14) injects the cooled
refrigerant into the evaporator (11), where it
evaporates, and the fresh air inflow removes
the required evaporation heat. The moisture
is taken out of the cooled air as condensed
water, dehumidifying the air.

At the center of the system is a tempera-
ture control circuit for interior temperature.
The setpoint temperature (as described in
“Electronic heater control”) determined by
the control unit is achieved by means of

2

Refrigerant circuit of an air conditioning system

 water-side or air-side adjustments (Fig. 3).
The fresh air (a) taken in by the fan (Item 1)
is, depending on the temperature, either
cooled by the evaporator (2) or heated by
the heater core (4) and then, depending on
the flap position, guided into the desired 
areas of the interior (b, c, f).

By means of various temperature sensors

(3, 5, 7) the ECU (8) collects all important
influencing and disturbance values and the
temperature selected by the occupants on
the setpoint controller (6) and uses all of
this information to continuously calculate
the setpoint value. This setpoint value is
compared to the actual temperature, and the
calculated difference generates reference
variables in the ECU for regulating the heat-
ing (4, 11), cooling (2, 10) and air flow (1).
Another function controls the position of
the air distribution flaps (b, c, d, e, f) de-
pending on the program the occupants have
selected. Meanwhile, all control circuits con-
tinue to respond to manual inputs.

Infinitely variable or stepped blower con-
trol is used to adjust the air flow to the speci-

fied level. Generally, the control system does
not process the actual value in this operation. 

This type of arrangement is inadequate for
dealing with increases in flow rate caused by
aerodynamic pressure at high driving
speeds. Here, a special control function can
compensate by responding to increasing ve-
hicle speeds, initially by reducing the blower
speed to zero, and then, if the flow continues
to rise, by using a restriction flap to throttle
the flow of incoming air. Air distribution to
the three levels – defroster (b), upper com-
partment (c), and footwell (f) – is controlled
manually, with preselection, or with a fully
automatic program. Most popular are units
featuring program control buttons, in which
each button provides a specific air distribu-
tion pattern for the three levels. 

The defroster mode (“DEF” setting) is a spe-
cial case. In order to clear the windows as
rapidly as possible, the temperature control
must revert to maximum heat and maxi-
mum blower speed, while the air flow is di-
rected through the upper defroster outlets.
On systems with program switches and fully
automatic units, this operating mode is se-
lected with a single button; at temperatures
above 0°C, the refrigeration unit is also acti-
vated to extract humidity from the air. To
prevent unheated air from causing drafts,
the blower is switched off electronically after
cold starts in winter, except when “DEF” and
the cooling function are in operation.

The variations described above are used in
both passenger cars and trucks. Buses re-
quire more complicated layouts. The passen-

be divided into several
control zones, in which

Vehicle security systems

Acoustic signaling devices

Vehicle security systems

Acoustic signaling devices

Application
The internationally applicable ECE Regula-
tion No. 28 specifies that acoustic signals
produced by motor vehicles must maintain a
uniform sound quality with no perceptible
frequency fluctuations during operation.
Operation is permitted only as a hazard
warning function. In countries where this
regulation does not apply, the acoustic sig-
naling device is a wearing part subject to
heavy use. The use of sirens, signal bells and
the like is not permitted, nor is playing
melodies by triggering sound generators in a
given sequence. Signaling devices must be
installed facing forward in the vehicle and
must produce the signal at a sufficient loud-
ness level at a distance of 2 m. They are sub-
jected to temperatures ranging from –40°C
to +90°C and must be designed to be resis-
tant to moisture, salt spray as well as me-
chanical shock and vibration. Elastic cou-
plings must be used to decouple electric
horns and fanfare horns from the vehicle
body, as the horn would otherwise induce
sympathetic oscillations in the adjacent
bodywork. The resulting feedback would di-
minish both loudness level and tone quality.
Both electric and electropneumatic horns
and fanfare horns are sensitive to series re-
sistors in their control circuits. When horns
are installed in pairs, they should be trig-
gered by relays. The warning produced by
the impact horn is more conspicuous; there-
fore, it is the better choice for vehicles that
are frequently used for long-distance over-
land truck traffic instead of fanfare horns.
Alternatively, the fanfare horn is superior for
city driving, as pedestrians often find the
standard horn excessively loud and unpleas-
ant. Both sets of requirements can be ful-
filled by installing the two horn types to-
gether in a single system with a selector
switch for city or overland traffic. Standard
and fanfare horns both operate at standard-
ized frequencies. High and low tones can be
combined to produce a harmonious dual-
tone sound.

Horns
The mass of the armature together with the
flexible diaphragm forms an oscillating sys-
tem within the standard horn. When voltage
is applied to the solenoid coil controlled by a
contact breaker, the armature impacts against
the magnetic core at the horn’s basic fre-
quency. A fixed tone disk, directly attached to
the armature, responds to these intense peri-
odic impacts by radiating harmonic waves.
Legal regulations stipulate that the maximum
sound energy must lie within a band of 
1.8-3.55 kHz. This frequency explains the
horn’s relatively piercing sound. This sound,
which is essentially emitted along the horn’s
axis and outwards to the front, can be heard
above the background noise in traffic, even
over longer distances. The horn’s size is one 
of the factors which determine the basic fre-
quency and loudness level.

In addition to larger diameters, supertone
horns have a higher electrical power input.
Their warning signals can therefore still be
heard under extreme conditions (e.g. truck
driver’s cab).

Fanfare horns
The electropneumatic fanfare horn employs
the same basic actuating system as its stan-
dard counterpart. The main difference is
that the armature is allowed to vibrate freely
in front of the coil with no impact occur-
ring. The oscillating diaphragm induces vi-
bration of an air column within a tube. The
resonant frequency of the diaphragm and
the air column are tuned to each other and
determine the signal pitch. The tube is in the
shape of a funnel, with a wide opening to
enhance the efficiency of sound propaga-
tion. The funnel tube is generally coiled to
minimize the unit’s size.

The presence of upper harmonics in the
lower range of the frequency spectrum pro-
vides the fanfare horn with a rich, melodi-
ous sound. The tone is less penetrating than
that of a standard horn due to the more
consistent distribution of sound energy over
a wide spectrum.

multiple functions, i.e. they are also used
for the power window drive units and door
mirror adjustment. Electromechanical and
pneumatic central locking systems are actu-
ated via electrical contact switches in the ac-
tuators or locking cylinders in the driver’s
door, passenger’s door, trunk lid, and oper-
ating switches in the vehicle interior.
 Infrared and radio remote control systems
enhance operating convenience.

In newer comfort and convenience sys-
tems, the central locking system is locked on
starting off (vehicle speed signal) to prevent
the vehicle from being opened from the out-
side. The system is unlocked in the event of
an accident (crash sensor).

A distinction is made between opening,
closing and locking. In connection with the
opening and closing functions, manual op-
eration from the inside (e.g. occupants) is
possible at any time. When the system is

Central locking system

Application
The central locking and unlocking of the
 vehicle doors, trunk and fuel filler flap are
an integral part of the convenience system in
motor vehicles. Electric or pneumatic actua-
tors operate the mechanisms in the individ-
ual locking devices.

Locking systems
In pneumatic systems, a central electric
dual-pressure pump (vacuum/gauge pres-
sure) and dimensionally stable lines leading
to the diaphragms of the individual actua-
tors provide the opening and closing move-
ment of the locking system.

The electromechanical central locking sys-

tem (Fig. 1) features an electric servomotor
to drive the locking function at each point in
the system. This electric motor with a reduc-
tion gear drive unit actuates a mechanical
connection (rod, lever) responsible for the
locking device (Fig. 2). 

Open-loop control
All central locking systems feature a control
unit for signal processing. The control unit
is integrated in the housing in pneumatic
dual-pressure pump systems. In electro-
mechanical systems, it is located centrally, or
to minimize wiring, decentrally in the door
modules in connection with multiplex sys-
tems. The lines associated with decentral or
distributed door multiplex systems have

Vehicle security systems

Central locking systems, locking systems

locked, the locking mechanism is blocked as
theft deterrence and can only be operated
with the vehicle key from the outside or with
the remote control.

Locking systems

Application
The function of locking systems is to ensure
and maintain access authorization at all
times. Although lock mechanisms in motor
vehicles are subject to substantial wear and
tear as a result of prolonged cold, wet and
dirty conditions over several years, their
main design feature must be to reliably
 protect the vehicle and its occupants while
ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

Structure
The structure of a locking system is made up
of the following components (Fig. 1):
(cid:3) Locking bars on the body pillars
(cid:3) Side doors, door lock mechanisms, and
the associated mechanical and electrical
parts

(cid:3) Electrical components that make up the
access authorization facility and radio
 remote control (frequently assigned to
locking systems).

Depending on their location in the vehicle, 
a further distinction is made between the
following assemblies (with differing scope 
of functions):
(cid:3) Side door assembly
(cid:3) Trunk assembly
(cid:3) Hood assembly

The most important component of the
 locking system is the door lock mechanism
(Fig. 2). Its primary functions include:
(cid:3) Transmitting the structural forces be-
tween the door and the vehicle body
(cid:3) Reliably opening and closing the locking

(cid:3) Evaluating the mechanical or electrical

(cid:3) Storing the logic statuses (mechanical

mechanism

computer).

Method of operation
Accordingly, the lock mechanism is made 
up of assemblies that perform the following
functions:

The locking mechanism is responsible for

transmitting forces to initiate the opening
and closing functions. It consists of a catch,
pawl and latch.

The corresponding door lock striker is
mounted on the body pillar. During the
closing procedure, the door lock striker en-
gages in the latch. This centers the door,
while the catch holds it in the closed posi-
tion (main catch). In turn, the pawl then
positively locks the catch in position. 

This lock status is initially canceled to ini-

tiate the opening procedure. For this pur-
pose, the actuating forces applied at the in-
ner or outer door handles are transmitted to
the pawl. The pawl now releases the catch to
allow the door to be opened. The door lock
striker is fixed in position while the catch
swivels into the open position.

Mechanical locking system
Logic statuses of the lock mechanism
The logic unit of the lock mechanism per-
mits the mechanical decoupling or isolation

of the outer door handle, the inner opener
and the locking element. For instance, with
the door locked, the outer door handle can
be freely pulled with no response, and it is
consequently not possible to open the door
from the outside.

In addition, the inner opener (opening
from inside) and the locking element (un-
locking from inside) are inoperative in con-
nection with a theft deterrence system.

The rear door locks cannot be opened
from the inside when the childproof lock is
engaged. However, the occupants are able to
unlock the door from the inside to allow a
person providing assistance to open the
door from the outside. (Note the difference
compared to the theft deterrence system!)

trates the basic functions of one rear door
variant.

Locking systems

Design features
The lock mechanism is located in the wet
area inside the door. The adverse effects of
water and dust, the considerable impact load
that occurs when the door is slammed, and
the theft deterrence requirements necessitate
a sturdy, tough design. 

Currently, the typical locking parts and lever
mechanisms (Fig. 3) are made of steel mate-
rials (precision punched parts, springs, riv-
eted connections). Plastic components are
being used to an ever greater extent. How-
ever, they must fulfill their function even af-
ter a side impact or in the event of a vehicle
fire. Corrosion, friction and wear dictate
that the metal components undergo a com-
prehensive surface treatment process (vibra-
tory grinding, galvanizing, coating).

The parts of the locking mechanism are
sheathed in plastic materials to provide
 effective sound deadening in order to satisfy
requirements to minimize closing noise.
Higher-grade lock mechanisms normally
feature extensive sound deadening measures
incorporated in the lever mechanisms and
actuators.

In the past, operation of automotive locks
was purely mechanical. Central locking was

3

Locking mechanism (schematic)

then introduced in the form of flange-
mounted locking actuators (electrically and
pneumatically operated control elements).
These actuators are now integrated in the

housing of more recent lock mechanisms.
Miniature motors carry out the electrical
commands from the access authorization
 facility in the form of mechanical actuating
movements. The locking status is stored
 mechanically in the lever mechanisms.

The output from the high-speed drive
units is converted in worm gear, multistage
spur gear or planetary gear mechanisms
(plastic materials). Spindle drive systems
are also used.

Sensors in the lock mechanism permit
the electrical evaluation of the lock status.
Hall effect sensors and microswitches have
proven particularly suitable for this pur-
pose.

Open-by-wire
The widespread use of electrical systems in
motor vehicle applications initially gave rise
to the central locking system, which was
soon followed by the theft deterrence system
and radio remote control. The childproof
lock is now switched electrically. Some door
closing and locking systems employ motors
to actuate the catch or the door lock striker
(servo closing). 

The obvious next step, therefore, is to use an
electric motor for the opening function, i. e.
to swivel the pawl (“open-by-wire”, Fig. 4).
Consequently, development of the “x-by-

wire” function for lock mechanisms has
been consistently pursued.

The main advantage of the “open-by-wire”
function is its interaction with access autho-
rization, particularly in connection with 
the use of “passive entry” systems, as they 
require either extremely fast unlocking 
actuators or “overtake” solutions.

Based on the “overtake principle”, the ac-
tuator begins the opening procedure in the
locking mechanism before the lock logic has
been completely released. This function is

intended to avoid waiting times for the user.
Corresponding design measures reliably rule
out the possibility of being locked in.

Electrical locking system
Demands for quality and reliability as well
as the pressures of rising costs render it nec-
essary in the future to minimize the number
of mechanical parts in the locking system
and replace them by electrical components.
The end point of the development is the
electrical locking system (Fig. 5).

The lock then consists of only the locking
mechanism, opening actuator and the asso-
ciated electronics. The door handles and
other operating elements are equipped with
sensors. Electrical wires replace the mechan-
ical connections to the lock.

The advantages of an electrical locking
 system are considerable:
(cid:3) Reduced size and weight of the lock
(cid:3) Symmetrical design
(cid:3) Only one lock variant per vehicle (variant
encoding at the end of the assembly line)
(cid:3) Door handles no longer move (or can be

dispensed with completely)

Auxiliary functions such as interior lighting,
status indicators and a whole range of other
functions will then be easy to implement in
electrical locking systems, as the lock is
equipped with electronics that can perform
these functions.

Communication with the locks, access
 authorization and power supply all take
place via the data bus interfaces. Prognoses
using fault tree analysis indicate that the
electrical locking system is just as reliable as
conventional systems. Economically feasible
systems can be expected with the introduc-
tion of the 42-V vehicle electrical system at
the latest (active redundant power supply).

Biometric systems

Biometric systems

Function
“Biometric systems” have the task of deter-
mining or confirming the identity of per-
sons on the basis of “biometric” features.
Currently, approximately ten biometric
methods are known, including fingerprint
identification, face recognition, iris recogni-
tion and voice recognition. 

Biometric systems in motor vehicles
Fingerprint identification is becoming estab-
lished in automotive applications, as crimi-
nology has developed a fundamental under-
standing of the techniques of fingerprint
distinction. 

As fingerprint identification will in the
 future replace passwords on computers, in
time management and access control sys-
tems, and on mobile phones as well, the
 development of sensors and algorithms has
already become widespread. Due to the con-
fined space available on board a motor vehi-
cle, there is also limited space for installing
the sensor.

Biometric features
Biometric features are features that are
uniquely characteristic to a particular person.
They may either be physiological features
(such as the pattern of a fingerprint) or be-
havioral characteristics (such as the way a
person walks or writes his/her signature). The
advantage of biometric systems is, firstly, for
the greater convenience of the user. Since bio-
metric features are part of a person’s individ-
uality, they are carried by the person at all
times and cannot be forgotten or lost. There is
no need to carry a key or a transponder card.
Secondly, they offer the advantage of an at-
tainable enhancement in security. Since bio-
metric features are intrinsic and unique to a
particular individual, they can neither be 
deliberately given to others nor stolen in the
traditional sense of the word. Therefore, a
high level of reliance can be placed on
whether the vehicle really is being driven 
by a known  driver. 

Enrollment
In order to be able to recognize a user, a bio-
metric system must first of all learn the fin-
gerprint pattern of that person. This process
is known as “enrollment”. It involves the user
placing his/her finger on a fingerprint sensor
that generates a grayscale image (typical size:
64,000 to 96,000 pixels at a resolution of
8 bits/pixel, Fig. 1). 

Using signal-processing algorithms, a

processor calculates the characteristics
 features within that image, e.g. branches
or nodal points in the line pattern. The bio-
metric system then stores these features –
though not as an actual fingerprint pattern –
in a permanent database, typically in an
EEPROM memory (capacity requirement:
250 to 600 bytes per fingerprint).

When the biometric system checks a per-
son’s fingerprint pattern the next time, it
again identifies the characteristic features of
the fingerprint and then searches the data-
base for a matching set of features. If it finds
a match, the person is recognized as an
 authorized user.

Examples of application
Many vehicles already have programmable
seat adjustment functions. The control panel
typically has three numbered memory but-
tons, which can be assigned to three differ-
ent drivers, and a teach-in button. The
 drivers of the vehicle will have to select a
memory button for each driver and then
 remember which button contains their own
settings. The number of drivers that can use
the system is limited by the number of
memory buttons.

The use of a biometric system significantly
enhances the level of personalized conve-
nience. In this system, a fingerprint sensor
replaces the memory buttons for the pro-
grammable seat adjustment system (Fig. 2).
Instead of pressing a memory button to re-
call his/her personal settings, the driver
places a finger on the sensor. Since biometric
features are intrinsic to a particular individ-

Vehicle security systems

Biometric systems

495

ual, the biometric system can always identify
a particular driver reliably and apply the
correct personal settings. 

If a previously unknown driver places
his/her finger on the sensor to store his/her
personal settings, the biometric system auto-
matically performs an enrollment sequence
and then memorizes the current settings.
Once a driver is known to the biometric
 system, only the current settings are stored. 

The advantage for the user lies in the sim-

plified human-machine interface. Users no
longer have to agree on the allocation of
memory buttons, nor do they have to re-
member which button is theirs. In addition,
the maximum number of users is not lim-
ited to the number of memory buttons
available. Ultimately, the number of users is
limited by the biometric system’s memory
capacity for user identities and personal
 settings.

Personalization can be extended beyond

seat adjustment, mirror adjustment and
steering column adjustment functions.
 Theoretically, all configurable vehicle sys-
tems can be connected to the biometric per-
sonalization system. It could be conceivable
to personalize air conditioning and auto-
matic transmission settings (sports/econ-
omy). For the radio, a set of personal fa-
vorite stations and preferred volume and
tone settings could be selected, while there
could be list of favorite destinations for the
navigation system. Similarly, if the vehicle
has configurable displays, a driver’s personal
preferences for the display elements could be
recalled. 

In the case of self-teaching assistance sys-
tems which adapt to the driver’s driving pat-
terns, the “last known settings” regarding
driver characteristics could be retrieved by
the personalization system before starting
off.

Biometric systems can also be used even
before starting the engine as a means of im-
plementing a vehicle immobilizer and for
 vehicle access. Vehicles equipped with this
technology could then be driven entirely
without the use of keys. With regard to the

use as a vehicle immobilizer, it has not yet
been definitively demonstrated that the same
degree of security is attainable as with the
present transponder-based immobilizers. 

For vehicle access applications, the sensors
for identifying the fingerprint pattern would
have to be integrated in the vehicle’s outer
skin. The technical challenge is then to de-
sign a sufficiently resilient sensor system that
is adequately protected against external con-
ditions so that effective usability is guaran-
teed at all times – including in winter.

496     Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC ranges

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
and interference suppression

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
consists of two elements. One is under-
stood as the ability of a device to con-
tinue providing reliable service when ex-
posed to electromagnetism from external 
sources. The second aspect focuses on 
electromagnetic fields generated by the 
same device; these should remain mini-
mal in order to avoid creating interfer-
ence that would impinge upon the qual-
ity of radio reception, etc. in the vicinity.

Today’s vehicle contains a multitude of 
systems whose functions are implemented 
by electrical or electronic components. 
These same functions, if present at all, 
used to be carried out fully or predomi-
nantly mechanically. With the exception  
of two-way transceivers used in special-
purpose applications, a car’s radio was 
once the only device in which signal 
 reception was of any importance. 

In contrast, today’s vehicles feature a 
host of devices that rely on the reception 
of electromagnetic radio waves. Mobile 
phones, navigation systems, theft-deter-
rent systems with radio remote control, 
and integrated fax and PC units are now 
being installed and used in vehicles.  
This trend has led to a commensurate 
 increase in the importance of suppressing 
interference and ensuring reception in  
the vehicle of the operationally vital radio 
waves.

EMC ranges

Transmitter and receiver
All vehicle systems must remain impervi-
ous to electromagnetic radiation emitted 
from such external sources as extremely 
powerful radio transmitters. In other 
words, there must be no threat to the 
 motor vehicle’s operational integrity,  
and malfunctions representing a potential 
source of driver irritation are unaccept-
able. Another consideration is that station-
ary receivers should remain unaffected by 
passing traffic. Both considerations are 
governed by national and international 
codes (EU Directives, German StVZO).

Electrical and electronic components
Motor vehicles contain an extensive array 
of electrical and electronic components 
 including servo and fan motors, solenoid 
valves, electronic sensors and control 
units with microprocessors. These devices 
must rely on a single vehicle electrical 
 system for their power supply. It is thus 
 vital to avoid mutual interference and 
feedback phenomena generated by one  
or several systems so that these do not 
cause malfunction.

On-board electronic systems
Mobile communications equipment –  
such as the radio – also exists within an in-
terlinked environment including all of the 
vehicle’s electronic systems. Every device 
is powered via the same vehicle electrical 
system, and its reception antennas are lo-
cated in the immediate vicinity of potential 
radio-interference sources. These consid-
erations make it imperative that strict lim-
its are imposed on the levels of interfer-
ence emitted by on-board electronic sys-
tems. Compliance with official regulations 
is essential, and it is important to maintain 
interference-free reception in the vehicle 
even when conditions are well below opti-
mal.

Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between different systems in the vehicle     497

EMC between different 
 systems in the vehicle

Shared vehicle electrical system
All of the motor vehicle’s electrical systems 
rely on a single shared vehicle electrical 
system. Because the electric lines leading  
to the individual systems are frequently 
combined within a single wiring harness, 
feedback pulses can easily travel from one 
system to the I/O ports of its neighbor  
(Fig. 1).

This transfer of interference can be in 
the form of signal pulses (abrupt, steep 
jumps in current and voltage) generated 
during the switching on and off of various 
electrical components such as electric 
 motors, solenoid valves and actuators.  
Yet another source is the ignition system’s 
high-tension circuit. Similar to other inter-
ference signals (for instance the ripple  
on the power supply), these signal pulses  
can propagate through the wiring harness. 
These interference pulses then proceed  

to the I/O ports of adjacent systems either 
directly, through shared conductors such 
as the power supply (galvanic coupling),  
or indirectly, through capacitive and in-
ductive coupling stemming from electro-
magnetic emissions.

Galvanic coupling
Currents for two different electric circuits 
(such as a solenoid valve’s trigger loop and 
the electric circuit for assessing sensor 
data) flowing through a single conductive 
path (common ground through the vehicle 
chassis, etc.) will both generate a voltage 
owing to the consistent resistance in the 
shared conductor (Fig. 2a, next page). 
 Continuing with this sample scenario, the 
voltage produced by radio-interference 
source u1 has the effect of a supplementary 
signal voltage in signal circuit 2, and could 
lead to erroneous interpretation of the 
sensor signal. One remedy is to use sepa-
rate return lines for each electric circuit 
(Fig. 2b, next page).

Capacitive coupling
Capacitive coupling allows variable-peri-
odicity signals such as pulse voltages and 
sinusoidal alternating voltages to produce 
interference and crosstalk in adjacent 
electric circuits, even without the exis-
tence of a direct physical link (Fig. 3).  
The potential level of capacitive (interfer-
ence) voltage is proportional to such fac-
tors as the closeness of the neighboring 
conductor paths and the rise rate of the 
pulse-shaped voltage shifts (or the fre-
quency of the alternating voltage). The 
first step is to separate the conductive 
paths while at the same time extending  
the ramp periods during which signals  
rise and fall (or to limit the frequency of 
the alternating voltages to the absolute 
minimum required for the function).

Inductive coupling
Currents recurring with variable periodicity 
in one conductor can induce voltage pulses 
in adjoining circuits. These voltage pulses 
then generate current in the secondary cir-
cuit (Fig. 4). This is the inductive principle 
exploited in transformer design. One prime 
factor defining susceptibility to overcou-
pling is the signal’s rise and fall time (or al-
ternating voltage frequency), reflecting the 
situation encountered with capacitive cou-
pling. Also significant is the effective mutual 
inductance, as determined by such factors  
as the size of the wires and their relative 
routing. Strategies for avoiding inductive 
coupling include minimizing the dimensions 
of circuit wires, keeping critical circuits as 
far apart as possible from each other, and 
the avoidance of parallel conductive paths. 
The tendency toward inductive interference 
is especially pronounced in circuits carrying 
low-frequency signals (e.g. coupling into 
loudspeaker wiring).

Pulsation in the vehicle electrical system
One strategy for dealing with interference 
pulses in the vehicle electrical system 
 entails limiting the amplitude of the inter-
ference emanating from the radio-inter-
ference sources. On the other hand, the 
susceptible devices (affected electronic 
components) are designed for insensitivity 
to pulses of specific shapes and ampli-
tudes. The initial step was to list and clas-
sify the pulses encountered within vehicu-
lar electrical systems (Table 1). Special-
purpose pulse generators can be used  
to generate the test patterns defined in 
 Table 1 as a basis for assessing resistance 
to these interference waves in susceptible 
devices. Both the test pulses and the test 
technology are codified in standards  
(DIN 40 839, Section 1; ISO 7637, Section 1) 
including definitions of the measurement 
technology for evaluating emissions of 
pulse-pattern interference. Classifications 
based on pulse amplitude levels facilitate 
effective definition of radio-interference 
sources and the susceptible devices (inter-
ference receptors) within each vehicle.  
It would thus be possible to specify Class II 
for all of the radio-interference sources 

1 Mutual interference within power supply

within a vehicle while designing all the 
susceptible devices (e.g. control units)  
to comply with and exceed – by a certain 
safety margin – Class III. If suppressing 
 interference at the source proves to be 
cheaper or to involve less technical com-
plexity than reducing sensitivity at the re-
ceptors, the logical response might be to 
shift the definitions to Classes I/II. If the 
scenario is inverted, with the shielding  
of potential susceptible devices as the 
cheaper and simpler solution, then a  
move to Classes III/IV is warranted.

Because numerous wires are combined 
within a single wiring harness, each indi-
vidual conductor is potentially susceptible 
to inductive and capacitive interference. 
Although reduced in intensity, the resulting 
voltage pulses in adjacent supply lines can 
then appear as spurious signals at the in-
put ports and control outputs in neighbor-
ing systems. The test technology for simu-
lating crosstalk interference within wiring 
harnesses (as defined in DIN 40 839, 
 Section 3 and ISO 7637, Section 3) uses  
a standardized substitute wiring layout 
(capacitive clip) with a defined wiring 
 capacitance. Test pulses are fed into this

signal and control lines. The effects of  
low-frequency oscillations within vehicu-
lar electrical systems can be simulated by 
producing the desired signals with a signal 
generator and projecting these into the 
wiring harness through a current clamp. 
This process reflects the procedure de-
scribed above by serving as the basis for 
the correct balance between the amplitude 
of radiated interference pulses and the re-
sistance to interference of the potentially

the vehicle electrical system. These signals 
can stem from periodic switching opera-
tions, as found in high-intensity ignition 
systems, at the commutators in DC motors 
and from the CPU clock signals that are

nals can induce in mobile communications 
receiver equipment may impair reception 
or even render it impossible.

Spectrum
Pulsation within on-board electrical sys-
tems is usually based on  the analysis of 
current and voltage progressions as func-
tion of time (Fig. 5a). Amplitudes at specific 
frequencies are generally viewed as the 
prime criterion for evaluating interference 
signals affecting radio reception (Fig. 5b). 
Under standard conditions, the interfer-
ence signals encountered in the automotive 
environment are rarely isolated sinusoidal 
waves with single amplitudes recurring at 
consistent frequencies. Much more com-
mon are superimpositions consisting of 
 numerous oscillation components with  
a variety of amplitudes and frequencies. 
The “spectrum” for an interference signal 
is a portrayal of amplitude versus fre-
quency designed to facilitate evaluation of 
inter ference potential in individual wave-
bands (Figs. 6a and 6b). Table 4 (refer to 
section "Interference-suppression catego-
ries") lists the most significant wavebands 
for automotive applications. 

Interference test technology divides 
 interference signals into wide-band and 
narrow-band interference: a spectrum with 
a continuous, progressive curve (Fig. 6a) is 
indicative of wide-band interference, and 
identifies the corresponding radio-inter-
ference source as a wide-band interferer.  
A contrasting pattern composed of isolated 
spikes forming a so-called line spectrum 
 indicates narrow-band interference stem-
ming from narrow-band emitters (Fig. 6b). 
Initially, the classifications in either cat-
egory are arbitrary: among the factors that 
determine whether interference is emanat-
ing from a “wide-band” or “narrow-band” 
radio-interference source are the recep-
tion properties of the potentially suscepti-
ble devices as reflected in the characteris-
tics of the test equipment employed to 
monitor the emissions. 

In the case of radio interference this 
equipment is in the form of a selective 
laboratory receiver or spectral analysis 
unit. Similar to a radio tuner therefore, the 
tester thus measures the signal amplitude 
only within a specific narrow frequency 
band (receiver bandwidth). The test pro-
gresses through the entire relevant fre-
quency range using a procedure analogous 
to the station search function in standard 
radios: while maintaining the initial band-
width, the laboratory receiver proceeds 
through a range of frequen cies, either at 
graduated intervals or in a continuous 
progression. 

Interference signals recurring at fre-
quencies lower than the test bandwidth 
produce the continuous signal pattern 
 indicative of wide-band interference.  
If the frequency is higher than the test 
bandwidth, the test monitor will also pick 
up gaps in the spectrum, and the result  
will be the line spectrum that indicates 
narrow-band interference. 

Electric motors are a typical source of 

wide-band interference. Commutation 
 frequencies in electric motors are located 
around just a few 100 Hz, with the exact 
 figure depending on the motor’s number  
of poles and its speed. At a test bandwidth 
of 120 kHz (bandwidth corresponding to an 
FM radio tuner receiver bandwidth) this 
produces a continuous spectrum. At the 
same test bandwidth, a 2 MHz cycle fre-
quency (of the kind that might be encoun-
tered in a microprocessor-equipped con-
trol unit) will generate a completely differ-
ent spectrum, this time with the spiked line 
spectrum typical of narrow-band interfer-
ence (interference signal recurs at fre-
quency greater than test bandwidth).

While all electric motors – fans, wind-
shield wipers, servo units and fuel-supply 
pump, etc. – join the alternator as typical 
emitters of wide-band interference, yet an-
other potential emitter is the high-tension 
ignition circuit. In addition, low-frequency 
clock signals stemming from devices such 
as switching elements can produce wide-

502     Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between different systems in the vehicle

band interference. The list of narrow-band 
interference emitters includes the micro-
processors in control units as well as all 
other devices using high-frequency con-
trol signals.

Interference signals picked up by radio 
 receivers may also be of the so-called con-
ducted interference type, that is they may 
propagate through wiring and conductors 
(such as the radio’s power supply) or they 
can enter the receiver’s I/O ports via in-
ductive and capacitive radiation in the wir-
ing harness. However, interference usually 
enters through the antenna, either through 
coupling in the antenna cable, or because 
the antenna picks up the electromagnetic 
fields generated by radio-interference 
sources. One particularly effective trans-
mission antenna is the wiring harness. 
Other factors influencing the amplitude  
of the interference signals picked-up by 
the receiver are the vehicle-body structure 
and the type and location of the antenna.

laboratory setups and standardized test 
setups in shielded chambers. Interference 
is monitored with a laboratory receiver. 
Line lengths and other geometric dimen-
sions are specified. The power supply 
must be provided by a precisely defined 
vehicle electrical system. Voltage sources 
are also precisely defined, with laboratory 
specimens being powered from simulated 
vehicle electrical systems (Fig. 7).

Interference-suppression categories
Similar to pulsation in the vehicle electri-
cal system, narrow- and wide-band inter-
ference factors are classified by interfer-
ence-suppression category in order to 
 facilitate selection and design for specific 
applications. Within this classification 
 system, demands on sporadically active 
radio-interference sources are less strin-
gent than the requirements placed on 
components in continuous operation,  
such as the alternator. The permissible 
CISPR 25 (DIN/VDE 0879-2) radio interfer-
ence levels are listed in Table 2. Table 3 in-
dicates the permissible interference-field 
strengths for radiation measurements with 
antennas.

Narrow-band interference of the kind 
 generated by CPU clock signals in control 
units poses an especially acute problem 
for radio reception. These interference 
signals are always present (the control 

units are usually switched on along with 
the ignition). Also of significance is the fact 
that the radio receiver cannot distinguish 
these spurious signals from useful signals, 
making reception of weak transmissions 
impossible. This situation is reflected in 
the definition of interference-suppression 
categories. In a given interference-sup-
pression category, narrow-band interfer-
ences are assigned lower permissible in-
terference levels than wide-band interfer-
ences.

Because individual vehicle configuration 
also has a substantial effect on the quality 
of broadcast reception, the interference-
suppression data derived from laboratory 
testing must be confirmed in a practical 
automotive environment. The test involves 
measuring antenna voltage at the end of 
the antenna cable to which the radio re-
ceiver will subsequently be connected. 

CISPR 25 also prescribes limits for radio 

interference voltage as determined using 
this procedure (Table 4). It contains volt-
age levels defined to reflect the unfavor-
able reception conditions as encountered 
in motor vehicles, where the strengths of 
useful signals not only fail to exceed just  
a few mV, but also suffer from substantial 
fluctuation owing to vehicle motion and 
the multiple reception paths generated  
by signal reflections.

504     Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between the vehicle and its surroundings

Interference from electrostatic charges
ESD, or electrostatic discharge, can dam-
age or even destroy electronic compo-
nents. The voltages produced in the event 
of this discharging can be anywhere up to 
several volts, which in turn also generate 
very high, pulsed currents. For this reason, 
suitable measures are required to prevent 
the destructive effect or, better still, the 
discharges themselves. Electronic compo-
nents that come into contact with vehicle 
passengers are particularly endangered. 

ISO TR 10605 defines test procedures for 
examining the effects of electrostatic dis-
charge and the immunity to interference 
that components exhibit both in the labo-
ratory and when installed in the vehicle. 
The test is conducted with a suitable ESD 
test-pulse generator, usually in the shape 
of a pistol. The generator produces the 
high-voltage pulses that are then coupled 
into the test specimen.

EMC between the vehicle 
and its surroundings

Since early 1996, an official regulation  
has placed mandatory limits on radiation 
by the vehicle of interference affecting 
 stationary radio reception, while at the 
same time defining suppression require-
ments during exposure to external electro-
magnetic fields. This ordinance (European 
 Directive 95/54/EC) superseded an earlier 
directive of more limited scope, which 
only limited interference emissions while 
defining the homologation certification 
procedure governing EMC in motor vehi-
cles.

Emitted interference
Electromagnetic emissions radiated by mo-
tor vehicles must remain within the limits 
for narrow and wide-band signals (Fig. 1)  
to ensure that they do not interfere with 
 radio and television broadcasts or private 
transmissions. These limits are specified in 
the Directive 95/54/EC cited above as well 
as in VDE 0879, Section 1 and the CISPR 12 
standard. These regulations contain de-
tailed descriptions of the test procedure, 
which employs antennas set up at defined 
distances from the vehicle (10 meters,  
3 meters). 

The specifics of the test procedure are 

described in the regulations quoted. 

In practice, it is the ignition system that is 
usually responsible for the greatest amount 
of interference radiation. However, since a 
comprehensive range of measures have 
been taken to ensure good radio reception 
in the vehicle, the emitted interference is 
limited to such an extent that compliance 
with the legal limit values is usually com-
fortably achieved.

emissions source, radiation penetrates 
through gaps and apertures in the vehicle

body and interferes with on-board electri-
cal systems. The intensity of this effect (in-
cident radiation) varies according to com-
ponent locations, body configuration and 
the wiring harness.

Vehicle measurements
At one time the procedure for verifying that 
various electronic systems would continue 
to provide satisfactory performance under 
exposure to high-intensity fields involved 
driving the motor vehicle to a number of 
 different broadcast transmitter locations. 
Now, special test chambers are available  
for this purpose. 

These chambers must be surrounded 
(shielded) with a metallic casing to prevent 
the electromagnetic field generated during 
testing from radiating to the outside. In ad-
dition, the chambers must be equipped with 
absorption materials to inhibit formation 
of standing waves (nodes and antinodes), 
which would lead to major variations in 
field strength between the various measur-
ing points. 

The anechoic chamber is used for investi-
gating the overall performance of vehicle 
electrical systems under real-world oper-
ating conditions. The Bosch anechoic 
chamber (Fig. 2) is equipped with devices 
capable of generating high-frequency 
fields within a frequency range extending 
from 10 kHz to 18 GHz, with a maximum  
field strength of Emax = 200 V/m. Since 
these field strengths represent a health 
hazard, the test vehicle is operated via 
 remote control from within a shielded 
 control room, while testing is monitored 
by video cameras. The chamber is screened 
with metallic sheeting, and non-conduc-
tive materials (wood and plastic) line the 
interior, as metallic substances could 
 foster spurious readings. To prevent reflec-
tions and inhibit the formation of standing 
waves, walls and ceiling are covered by pyr-
amid-shaped absorption elements made of 
graphite-filled polyurethane foam. 

Vehicle testing proceeds on a chassis 
dynamometer (rolling road) capable of 
 accommodating simulated speeds of up to

200 km/h. A fan is also present to direct up 
to 40,000 m3/h (corresponding to a wind 
speed of 80 km/h) of air over the vehicle.
Among the advantages that distinguish 
indoor testing from the old open-air tests 
near transmitters is that the former method 
allows latitude for considerable variations 
in both frequency and field strength. This 
facilitates evaluation of vehicular resis-
tance to incident radiation under a wide 
range of conditions, and not at just a few 
available points. The ability to gradually 
increase field strengths right up to each 
electronic device’s operational limits fur-
nishes information on safety margins. 

Specifics defining the test procedures 
used in determining radiation resistance  
in the overall vehicle are described in  
DIN 40 839, Section 4. ISO 11452, Sec- 
tions 1 – 4 contain similar descriptions as 
elements within a more extensive compila-
tion of special-purpose test procedures.

Laboratory measurements
Although the data garnered from assess-
ments of incident radiation on the vehicle 
as a whole are invaluable, the disadvan-
tage of this type of testing is that it can 
only be performed at an advanced stage  
in the vehicle and electronic system design 
process. Only very limited latitude is avail-
able for responding to indications of inad-
equate resistance to incident radiation un-
covered at this stage. 

This explains the necessity to determine 
at an early stage how an electronic system 
will operate during subsequent use in its 
automotive environment: prompt informa-
tion allows effective recourse to remedial 
action when needed. Various test proce-
dures have emerged for obtaining the re-
quired information.

In the first of the three tests described 

below, interference waves propagating 
through a conductor are coupled into the 
wiring harness of the system under inves-
tigation. As the suitability of these test ar-
rangements for evaluating the frequency 
range beyond > 400 MHz is restricted,  

a different procedure is used for this 
range. The alternate procedure relies on 
antennas to project electromagnetic fields 
into standardized bench setups.

The specifics of the methods outlined 
below are defined in DIN 40 839, Section 4, 
and ISO 11 452, Sections 1 – 7 (which also 
contains additional process descriptions 
detailing less widespread methods).

All these methods furnish a precise pic-

ture of a system’s resistance to incident 
 radiation. This can then be used to imple-
ment improvements while the develop-
ment phase is still in progress. Thanks to 
this inestimable advantage it is now im-
possible to imagine development projects 
without these laboratory measurements  
as flanking measures.

It must be taken into consideration that 
the design of the electrical system in itself 
is not the only important factor. Because 
installation conditions in the vehicle and 
the routing of the wiring harness can also 
exercise a decisive influence on ultimate 
levels of interference resistance, all earlier 
results still need to be confirmed on a pro-
duction vehicle in the anechoic chamber.

Stripline method (Figs. 3 and 4)
The designation, “stripline”, refers to a 
conductor in the form of a strip. This con-
ductor has a length of 4.1 m and a width of 
0.74 m. It is arranged with a clearance of 
0.15 m above the conductive sheet (coun-
ter-electrode). A high-frequency alterna-
tor serves as the source of a transverse 
magnetic wave generated between the 
stripline and the counter-electrode, con-
tinuing until it reaches the terminal resis-
tor. The stripline dimensions have been 
 selected to minimize the likelihood of re-
flections occurring during wave propaga-
tion, thus ensuring constant field-strength 
amplitudes relative to frequency. 

A typical system setup might include a 
control unit, wiring harness and peri- 
pheral devices (sensors and actuators).  
These are set up at a height half way be-

Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between the vehicle and its surroundings     507

tween the base plate and the stripline,  
with the wiring harness in alignment with 
the waves’ direction of propagation. 

The field strength between the planes at  
a given frequency is then increased until 
the system malfunctions or until a maxi-
mum specified level is reached. If the in-
crements are small enough, repeating this 
process at progressively altered frequen-
cies will produce a detailed diagram por-
traying resistance to incident radiation as 
a function of frequency (Fig. 4).

Bulk current injection method (Fig. 5)
Bulk current injection (BCI) is an immunity 
test commonly used in the automotive  
and aircraft industry. As with the stripline 
method, the system being tested is ar-
ranged above a conductive sheet (counter-
electrode). A current clamp attached to the 
wiring harness injects transformer current 
into its individual wires. The vectorial sum 
of these currents corresponds to the total 
current radiated by the clamp. While test-
ing using the stripline method proceeds 
through a range of increasing field 
strengths, BCI relies on progressively 
higher current flows as it continues until 
the system malfunctions or until current 
reaches the specified terminal value.

TEM cell (Fig. 6)
As with the stripline method, a transverse 
electromagnetic field (TEM) is generated 
here between a strip conductor and a 
counter-electrode. The TEM counter-elec-
trode, however, is an enclosed housing 
 instead of a metal plate. This leads to an-
other distinguishing feature: TEM test 
benches do not need to be set up within 
specially shielded chambers.

A further difference lies in the fact that 
only the test specimen per se (for example: 
a control unit) is subject to electromag-
netic exposure. The peripheral equipment 
is located outside the TEM cell and is con-

 wiring harness arranged at right angles  
to the direction of propagation of the 
 electromagnetic waves. 

The measurement procedure is consis-

tent with that of the stripline method. 
Here, too, the field strength is increased 
until the system malfunctions or until a 
maximum specified level is reached.

Incident radiation via antenna
Once again similarities with the stripline 
method are encountered, as the test speci-
men, including control unit, wiring har-
ness and peripherals, is set up on a base 
plate. The wiring harness is laid out at  
a defined distance from this base plate.  
An antenna located at a specified distance 
from this assembly generates an electro-
magnetic field for projection into the en-
tire test setup. Again, field strength is 
raised until the system malfunctions or 
 until field strength reaches the maximum 
value specified for testing. 

Guarantee of immunity and 
interference suppression

As early as the planning and conception 
phases, EMC requirements for immunity  
to and suppression of radio interference 
have to be considered as part of every 
 development project focusing on any elec-
tronic system or component. The finished 
products must incorporate EMC measures 
as an integral design element.

EMC in the electronic control unit (ECU)
The first EMC requirement reflected in  
any ECU is to select microprocessor cycle 
frequencies that are as low as possible 
while simultaneously making every effort 
to keep the signal transit curves as flat as 
possible. EMC characteristics join stan-
dard operational aspects as an essential 
criterion governing the selection of com-
ponents (integrated circuits). Whereas the 
components’ resistance to interference 
must be maximal, its interference emis-
sions should be minimal. On printed-
 circuit boards designed for optimal EMC  
performance, all components with pro-
nounced sensitivity to interference, and  
all of those with the potential to cause it,

are decoupled from the connected wiring 
harness. This is done by locating the com-
ponents as far as possible from the plug 
connections.

Suppression components, usually ca-
pacitors designed for high-frequency ap-
plications, place the required restrictions 
on potentially disruptive interference. 
These interference-suppression capacitors 
are located either directly within the inte-
grated circuits or in the plug-connector 
area. The suppression elements in the 
plug-connector area combine with hous-
ings featuring optimal conductive proper-
ties (shielded casing) to prevent high-fre-
quency radiation in the immediate vicinity 
from reaching the inside of the ECU. This 
ensures that signals produced outside the 
unit do not cause interference inside the 
unit. On the other side of the coin, high-
frequency signals produced inside the unit 
do not cause undesirable interference in 
the surrounding environment. 

Electric motors and other  
electromechanical components 
Standard practice in the design of electric 
motors reflects the procedures used for 
ECUs and sensors by incorporating inter-
ference suppression in the design process 
right from the initial development stages. 
A sample problem is the interference pro-
duced by the brush arcing during current 
reversal in motors with commutator 
 control. This can severely disrupt radio 
 reception. Suitable suppression elements 
(capacitors and throttles) limit the inter-
ference. Motors are designed with optimal 
operation of these interference suppres-
sors in mind.

The voltage pulses produced during 
switching operations in electromagnetic 
actuators are kept to an acceptable level 
by suitable elements, such as quench 
 re sistors, in the circuit.

High-voltage ignition
The ignition system’s high-voltage circuit 
represents a potential source of substan-
tial interference to radio reception.  
One standard solution is to use spark plugs 
and cable sockets with noise-suppression 
resistors. While the resistor element is 
usually located at the end of the ignition 
cables, in modern (multiple-coil) systems 
it can be integrated within the dedicated 
ignition coils plugged directly onto the 
spark plugs for the individual cylinders.  
In using resistors, the object is to find a 
balance between the demand for ignition 
energy and the required level of interfer-
ence suppression. 

Retrofit interference suppression
As made clear in the above sections,  
EMC design considerations must be care-
fully aligned and balanced against opera-
tional requirements. Subsequent remedial 
measures superimposed on the original 
design at a later date usually entail sub-
stantial effort, and should be avoided in 
production vehicles. 

Should the interference-suppression 
measures incorporated in electrical com-
ponents prove inadequate for dealing with 
the conditions encountered in specific ap-
plications (in special-purpose emergency 
vehicles, etc.), supplementary action can 
be implemented to deal with the problem. 
Options include installation of filters as 
well as supplementary shielding for com-
ponents and wiring.

These options should be exercised with 

great care, as field modifications to elec-
tronic components can lead to operational 
malfunctions.

Fault diagnostics

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Monitoring during 
vehicle  operation
(on-board  diagnosis)
Overview
ECU-integrated diagnostics belong to the ba-
sic scope of electronic engine-management
systems. Besides a self-test of the  control unit,
input and output signals, and control-unit 
intercommunication are monitored.

On-board diagnosis of an electronic system

is the capability of a control unit to interpret
and perform self-monitoring using “software
intelligence”, i.e. detect, store, and diagnosti-
cally interpret errors and faults. On-board 
diagnosis runs without the use of any addi-
tional equipment.

Monitoring algorithms check input and
output signals during vehicle operation, and
check the entire system and all its functions
for malfunctions and disturbances. Any er-
rors or faults detected are stored in the con-
trol-unit fault memory. Stored fault informa-
tion can be read out via a serial interface.

Fault diagnostics

The rise in the sheer amount of electronics 
in the automobile, the use of software to con-
trol the vehicle, and the increased complexity
of modern fuel-injection systems place 
high demands on the diagnostic concept,
monitoring during vehicle operation
(on-board diagnosis), and workshop diag-
nostics (Fig. 1). The workshop diagnostics 
is based on a guided troubleshooting proce-
dure that links the many possibilities of on-
board and offboard test procedures and test
equipment. As emission-control legislation
becomes more and more stringent and con-
tinuous monitoring is now called for, law-
makers have now acknowledged on-board 
diagnosis as an aid to monitoring exhaust-
gas emissions, and have produced manufac-
turer-independent standardization. This
 additional system is termed the on-board
 diagnostic system.

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

511

Input-signal monitoring
Sensors, plug connectors, and connecting
lines (signal path) to the control unit (Fig. 2)
are monitored by evaluating the input signal.
This monitoring strategy is capable of detect-
ing sensor errors, short-circuits in the bat-
tery-power circuit UBatt and vehicle-ground
circuit, and line breaks. The following 
methods are applied:
(cid:3) Monitoring sensor supply voltage (if 

applicable).

(cid:3) Monitoring detected values for permissible

value ranges (e.g. 0.5....4.5 V).

(cid:3) If additional information is available, a
plausibility check is conducted using the
detected value (e.g. comparison of crank-
shaft speed and camshaft speed).

(cid:3) Critical sensors (e.g. pedal-travel sensor)
are fitted in redundant configuration,
which means that their signals can be
 directly compared with each other.

Output-signal monitoring
Actuators triggered by a control unit via out-
put stages (Fig. 2) are monitored. The moni-
toring functions detects line breaks and
short-circuits in addition to actuator faults.
The following methods are applied:
(cid:3) Monitoring an output signal by the output
stage. The electric circuit is monitored for
short-circuits to battery voltage UBatt, to 
vehicle ground, and for open circuit.
(cid:3) Impacts on the system by the actuator 
are detected directly or indirectly by a 
function or plausibility monitor. System
actuators, e.g. exhaust-gas recirculation
valves, throttle valves, or swirl flaps, are
monitored indirectly via closed-control
loops (e.g. continuous control variance),
and also partly by means of position sen-
sors (e.g. position of turbine geometry in
the exhaust-gas turbocharger).

Fault diagnostics

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Error handling
Error detection
A signal path is categorized at finally defective
if an error occurs over a definite period of
time. Until the defect is categorized, the sys-
tem uses the last valid value detected. When
the defect is categorized, a standby function is
triggered (e.g. engine-temperature substitute
value T = 90°C).

Most errors can be rectified or detected 
as intact during vehicle operation, provided
the signal path remains intact for a definite
period of time.

Fault storage
Each fault is stored as a fault code in the 
non-volatile area of the data memory. 
The fault code also describes the fault type
(e.g. short-circuit, line break, plausibility,
value range exceeded). Each fault-code input
is accompanied by additional information,
e.g. the operating and environmental con -
ditions (freeze frame) at the time of fault
 occurrence (e.g. engine speed, engine temper-
ature). 

Limp-home function
If a fault is detected, limp-home strategies can
be triggered in addition to substitute values
(e.g. engine output power or speed limited).
These strategies help to: 
(cid:3) Maintain driving safety
(cid:3) Avoid consequential damage
(cid:3) Minimize exhaust-gas emissions

Monitoring internal ECU functions
Monitoring functions are implemented in
control-unit hardware (e.g. “intelligent” out-
put-stage modules) and software to ensure
that the control unit functions correctly at all
times. The monitoring functions check each
of the control-unit components (e.g. micro-
controller, flash EPROM, RAM). 
Many tests are conducted immediately after
startup. Other monitoring functions are
 performed during normal operation and re-
peated at regular intervals in order to detect
component failure during operation. Test
runs that require intensive CPU capacity, or
that cannot be performed during vehicle op-
eration for other reasons, are conducted in af-
ter-run more when the engine is switched off.
This method ensures that the other functions
are not interfered with. In the common-rail
system for diesel engines, functions such as
the injector switchoff paths are tested during
engine runup or  after-run. With a spark-igni-
tion engine, functions such as the flash
EPROM are tested in engine after-run.

Monitoring ECU communication
As a rule, communication with other ECUs
takes place over the CAN bus (Controller
Area Network). The CAN protocol contains
control mechanisms to detect malfunctions.
As a result, transmission errors are even de-
tectable at CAN-module level. A number of
other checks are also performed in the ECU.
Since the majority of CAN messages are sent
at regular intervals by the individual control
units, the failure of a CAN controller in a
control unit is detectable by testing at regular
intervals. In addition, when redundant infor-
mation is available in the ECU, the received
signals are checked in the same way as all in-
put signals.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

513

On-board diagnosis system 
for passenger cars and 
light-duty trucks
The engine system and its components must
be constantly monitored in order to comply
with exhaust-gas emission limits specified by
law in everyday driving situations. For this
reason, regulations have come into force to
monitor exhaust-gas systems and compo-
nents, e.g. in California. This has standard-
ized and expanded manufacturer-specific on-
board diagnosis with respect to the monitor-
ing of emission-related components and sys-
tems.

Legislation
OBD I (CARB)
1988 marked the coming into force of OBD I
in California, that is, the first stage of CARB
legislation (California Air Resources Board).
The first OBD stage makes the following re-
quirements:
(cid:3) Monitoring emission-related electrical

components (short-circuits, line breaks)
and storage of faults in the control-unit
fault memory.

(cid:3) A Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) that

alerts the driver to the malfunction.
(cid:3) The defective component must be dis-

played by means of on-board equipment
(e.g. blink code using a diagnosis lamp).

OBD II (CARB)
The second stage of the diagnosis legislation
(OBD II) came into force in California in
1994. OBD II became mandatory for diesel-
engine cars with effect from 1996. In addition
to the scope of OBD I, system functionality
was now monitored (e.g. plausibility check of
sensor signals).

OBD II stipulates that all emission-related
systems and components must be monitored
if they cause an increase in toxic exhaust-gas
emissions in the event of a malfunction (by
exceeding the OBD limits). Moreover, all
components must be monitored if they are

used to monitor emission-related compo-
nents or if they can affect the diagnosis re-
sults.

Normally, the diagnostic functions for all
components and systems under surveillance
must run at least once during the exhaust-gas
test cycle (e.g. FTP 75). A further stipulation
is that all diagnostic functions must run with
sufficient frequency during daily driving
mode. For many monitoring functions, the
law defines a monitoring frequency (In 
Use Monitor Performance Ratio) in daily 
operation starting model year 2005.

Since the introduction of OBD II, the law
has been revised in several stages (updates).
The last update came into force in model year
2004. Further updates have been announced.

OBD (EPA)
Since 1994 the laws of the EPA (Environmen-
tal Protection Agency) have been in force in
the remaining U.S. states. The scope of these
diagnostics comply for the most part with 
the CARB legislation (OBD II). 

The OBD regulations for CARB and 
EPA apply to all passenger cars with up to
12 seats and to light-duty trucks weighing up
to 14,000 lbs (6.35 t).

EOBD (EU)
The OBD attuned to European conditions is
termed EOBD and is based on the EPA-OBD. 
EOBD has been valid for all passenger cars
and light-duty trucks equipped with gasoline
engines and weighing up to 3.5 t with up to 
9 seats since January 2000. Since January 2003
the EOBD also applies to passenger cars and
light-duty trucks with diesel engines.

Other countries
A number of other countries have already
adopted or are planning to adopt EU or
US-OBD legislation.

514

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Requirements of the OBD system
The ECU must use suitable measures to mon-
itor all on-board systems and components
whose malfunction may cause a deterioration
in exhaust-gas test specifications stipulated by
law. The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
must alert the driver to a malfunction if the
malfunction could cause an overshoot in
OBD emission limits.

Emission limits
The U.S. OBD II (CARB and EPA) prescribes
thresholds that are defined relative to emis-
sion limits. Accordingly, there are  different
permissible OBD emission limits for the vari-
ous exhaust-gas categories that are applied
during vehicle certification (e.g. TIER, LEV,
ULEV). Absolute limits apply in Europe
(Table 1).

Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
alerts the driver that a component has mal-
functioned. When a malfunction is detected,
CARB and EPA stipulate that the MIL must
light up no later than after two driving cycles
of its occurrence. Within the scope of EOBD,
the MIL must light up no later than in the
third driving cycle with a detected malfunc-
tion. 

If the malfunction disappears (e.g. loose
contact), the malfunction remains entered in
the fault memory for 40 trips (warmup cy-
cles). The MIL goes out after three fault-free
driving cycles.

Communication with scan tool
OBD legislation prescribes standardization of
the fault-memory information and access to
the information (connector, communication
interface) compliant with ISO 15 031 and the
corresponding SAE standards (Society of Au-
tomotive Engineers). This permits the read-
out of the fault memory using standardized,
commercially available testers (scan tools, see
Fig. 1).

Depending on their scope of application,
various communication protocols are used
throughout the world: The most important
are:
(cid:3) ISO 9141-2 for European passenger cars.
(cid:3) SAE J 1850 for U.S. passenger cars.
(cid:3) ISO 14 230-4 (KWP 2000) for European
passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
(cid:3) SAE J 1708 for U.S. commercial vehicles.

These serial interfaces operate at a bit rate
(baud rate) of 5 to 10 k baud. They are de-
signed as a single-wire interface with a com-
mon wire for both transmission and recep-
tion, or as a two-wire interface with a sepa-
rate data line (K-line) and initiate line
(L-line). Several electronic control units (such
as Motronic, ESP, or EDC, and transmission-
shift control, etc.) can be combined on one
diagnosis connector.

Communication between the tester and

ECU is set up in three phases:
(cid:3) Initiate the ECU.
(cid:3) Detect and generate baud rate.
(cid:3) Read key bytes which identify the transmis-

sion protocol.

Evaluation is performed subsequently. 
The following functions are possible: 
(cid:3) Identify the ECU 
(cid:3) Read the fault memory 
(cid:3) Erase the fault memory 
(cid:3) Read the actual values 

In future, the CAN bus (ISO 15 765-4) will be
used increasingly to handle communication
between ECUs and the tester. Starting 2008
diagnostics will only be permitted over this
interface in the U.S.A.

To make it easier to read out the ECU fault-
memory information, a standardized diagno-
sis socket will be fitted at an easily  accessible
place in every car (easy to reach from the 
driver’s seat). The socket is used to connect
the scan tool (Fig. 2). 

Reading the fault information
Any workshop can use the scan tool to read
out emission-relevant fault information from
the ECU (Fig. 3). In this way, workshops not
franchized to a particular manufacturer are
also able to carry out repairs. Manufacturers
are obliged to make the  required tools and 
information available (on the internet) in 
return for a reasonable payment, to allow
this.

Vehicle recall
If vehicles fail to comply with OBD require-
ments by law, the authorities may demand the
vehicle manufacturer to start a recall at his
own cost.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Temporary disabling of diagnostic functions
Diagnostic capabilities may only be disabled
under certain conditions in order to prevent
false diagnosis. Examples include:
(cid:3) Height too large.
(cid:3) Low ambient temperature at engine

switchon. 

(cid:3) Low battery voltage.

Readiness code
When the fault memory is checked, it is im-
portant to know that the diagnostic capabili-
ties ran at least once. This can be checked by
reading out the readiness code over the diag-
nostic interface. After erasing the fault mem-
ory in service, the readiness codes must be 
reset after checking the functions.

Diagnostic System Management (DSM)
The diagnostic capabilities for all compo-
nents and systems checked must normally
run in driving mode, but at least once during
the exhaust-gas test cycle (e.g. FTP 75,
NEDC). Diagnostic System Management
(DSM) can change the sequence for running
the diagnostic capabilities dynamically,
 depending on driving conditions.

The DSM comprises the following three

components (Fig. 4):

Diagnosis Fault Path Management (DFPM)
The primary role of DFPM is to store fault
states that are detected in the system. In addi-
tion to faults, it also stores other information,
such as environmental conditions (freeze
frame).

Functional requirements
Overview
Just as for on-board diagnosis, all ECU input
and output signals, as well as the components
themselves, must be monitored. 

Legislation demands the monitoring of

electrical functions (short-circuit, line
breaks), a plausibility check for sensors, 
and a function monitoring for actuators.

The pollutant concentration expected as
the result of a component failure (empirical
values), and the monitoring mode partly
 required by law determine the type of
 diagnostics. A simple functional test
(black/white test) only checks system or com-
ponent operability (e.g. swirl flap opens and
closes). The extensive functional test provides
more detailed information about system op-
erability. As a result, the limits of adaption
must be monitored when monitoring adap-
tive fuel-injection functions (e.g. zero deliv-
ery calibration for a diesel engine, lambda
adaption for a gasoline engine). 

Diagnostic complexity has constantly
 increased as emission-control legislation 
has evolved. 

Switchon conditions
Diagnostic capabilities only run if the
switchon conditions are satisfied. 
This  includes, for instance: 
(cid:3) Torque thresholds
(cid:3) Engine-temperature thresholds
(cid:3) Engine-speed thresholds or limits

Inhibit conditions
Diagnostic capabilities and engine functions
cannot always operate simultaneously. 
There are inhibit conditions that prohibit 
the performance of certain functions. In the
diesel system, the Hot-Film Air-Mass Meter
(HFM) can only be monitored satisfactorily
when the exhaust-gas recirculation valve is
closed. For instance, tank ventilation (evapo-
rative-emissions control system) in a gasoline
system cannot function when catalytic-con-
verter diagnosis is in operation.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

517

Diagnostic Function SCHEDuler (DSCHED)
DSCHED is responsible for coordinating
 assigned engine capabilities (MF) and diag-
nostic capabilities (DF). It obtains informa-
tion from DVAL and DFPM to carry this out.
In addition, it reports functions that  require
release by DSCHED to perform their readi-
ness, after which the  current  system state is
checked.

Diagnosis VALidator (DVAL)
The DVAL (only installed in gasoline systems
to date) uses current fault-memory  entries
and additionally stored information to decide
for each detected fault whether it is the actual
cause, or a consequence of the fault. As a re-
sult, validation provides stored information
to the diagnostic tester for use in reading out
the fault memory.

In this way, diagnostic capabilities can 
be released in any sequence. All released
 diagnoses and their results are evaluated sub-
sequently.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Catalytic converter diagnosis
In the diesel system, carbon monoxide (CO)
and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) are oxi-
dized in the oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter. Work is ongoing on diagnostic capa-
bilities for monitoring the operation of oxi-
dation-type catalytic converters relating to
temperature and differential pressure. One
approach focuses on active secondary injec-
tion (intrusive operation). Here, heat is gen-
erated in the oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter by an exothermic HC reaction. The
temperature is measured and compared with
calculated model values. These are used to 
derive the functionality of the  catalytic con-
verter.

Equally, work is ongoing on monitoring
functions for the storage and regeneration ca-
pabilities of NOx accumulator-type catalytic
converters that will also be installed in the
diesel system in future. The monitoring func-
tions run based on loading and regeneration
models, and the measured regeneration dura-
tion. This requires the use of lambda or NOx
sensors.

Combustion-miss detection
Incorrect fuel injection or loss of compres-
sion result in impaired combustion, and thus
to changes in emission values. The misfire de-
tector evaluates the time expired (segment
time) from one combustion cycle to the next
for each cylinder. This time is derived from
the speed-sensor signal. A segment time that
is longer than for the other cylinders indicates
a misfire or loss of compression.

In the diesel system, diagnosis of combus-

tion misses is only required and performed
when the engine is at idle speed.

Fuel system diagnosis
In the common-rail system, a fuel-system di-
agnosis includes the electrical monitoring of
injectors and rail-pressure control (high-pres-
sure control). In the Unit Injector System, it
also includes monitoring of the injector
switching time. Special functions of the fuel-
injection system that increase injected-fuel-
quantity precision are also monitored. 

Examples of this include zero-fuel-quantity
calibration, quantity-mean-value adaptation,
and the AS MOD observer function (air-sys-
tem model observer). The two last functions
use information from the lambda oxygen sen-
sor as input signals. From the models, they
calculate fluctuations between setpoint and
actual quantities.

Lambda-oxygen-sensor diagnosis
Modern diesel systems are fitted with broad-
band oxygen sensors. They require a different
diagnostic procedure than two-stage sensors
since their settings may deviate from λ = 1.
They are monitored electrically (short-circuit,
line interruption) and for plausibility. The
heater element of the sensor heater is tested
electrically and for permanent governor 
deviation.

Exhaust-gas recirculation system diagnosis
In the exhaust-gas recirculation system, the
EGR valve and – if fitted – the exhaust-gas
cooler are monitored. 

The exhaust-gas recirculation valve is mon-

itored for its electrical and functional oper-
ability. Functional monitoring is performed
by air-mass regulators and position con-
trollers. They check for permanent control
variances.

If the exhaust-gas recirculation system 
has a cooler fitted, its function must also be
monitored, i.e. an additional temperature
measurement takes place downstream of the
cooler. The temperature measured is com-
pared with a setpoint value calculated from 
a model. If a fault occurs, it is detected by
measuring the deviation between setpoint
and actual values.

Crankcase ventilation diagnosis
Faults in crankcase ventilation are detected by
the air-mass sensor, depending on the system.
The legislation requires no monitoring if the
crankcase ventilation has a “rugged” design.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

519

Engine cooling system diagnosis 
The cooling system comprises a thermostat
and a coolant-termperature sensor. If the
thermostat is defective, for instance, the en-
gine temperature can only rise slowly and,
consequently, the exhaust emission rates may
increase. The diagnostic function for the ther-
mostat uses the coolant-termperature sensor
to check that a nominal temperature has been
reached. A temperature model is also used for
monitoring.

The coolant-termperature sensor is moni-
tored to ensure that a minimum temperature
has been reached in addition to monitoring
for electrical faults by means of a  dynamic
plausibility function. Dynamic plausibility is
performed as the engine cools down. These
functions can monitor the sensor for “stick-
ing” in both low and high temperature
ranges. 

Air-conditioner diagnosis
The engine can be operated at a different 
operating point in order to cover the air-
conditioner’s electrical load requirements.
The required diagnosis must therefore
 monitor all electronic components in the 
air conditioner that may cause an increase 
in emissions if they malfunction.

Particulate-filter diagnosis
The particulate filter is currently monitored
for filter breakage, removal, or blockage. 
A differential-pressure sensor is used to 
measure differential pressure (exhaust-gas
backpressure downstream and upstream 
of the filter) at a specific volumetric flow. 
The measured value can be used to decide
whether the filter is defective.

Comprehensive components
On-board diagnosis legislation requires that
all sensors (e.g. air-mass meter, wheel-speed
sensors, temperature sensors) and actuators
(e.g. throttle valve, high-pressure pump, glow
plugs) must be monitored if they either have
an impact on emissions, or are used to moni-
tor other components or systems (and conse-
quently, may block other diagnoses).

Sensors monitor the following faults (Fig. 5):
(cid:3) Electrical faults, i.e. short-circuits and line

breaks (signal-range check).

(cid:3) Range faults (out-of-range check), i.e. un-
dercutting or exceeding voltage limits de-
fined by the physical measurement range of
a sensor.

(cid:3) Plausibility faults (rationality check); these
are faults that are inherent in the compo-
nents themselves (e.g. drift), or which may
be caused by shunts, for instance. Monitor-
ing is carried out by a plausibility check on
the sensor signals, either by using a model,
or directly using other sensors.

Actuators must be monitored for electrical
faults and – if technically possible – also for
function. Functional monitoring means that,
when a control command (setpoint value) is
given, it is monitored by observing or mea-
suring (e.g. by a position sensor) the system
reaction (actual value) in a suitable way by
using information from the system. 

Besides all output stages, the following

 actuators are monitored:
(cid:3) throttle valve 
(cid:3) exhaust-gas recirculation valve
(cid:3) variable turbine geometry of the 

exhaust-gas turbocharger

(cid:3) swirl flap
(cid:3) glow plugs

On-board diagnosis system

In Europe and the U.S.A., there exist draft
laws that have not yet been adopted; they are
based closely on legislation for passenger cars.

Legislation
In the EU, there are plans to introduce new
type approvals in October 2005 (coinciding
with Euro 4 emission-control legislation).
With effect from October 2006 an OBD sys-
tem will become obligatory for every com-
mercial vehicle. In the U.S.A., the draft of the
Californian CARB provides for the introduc-
tion of an OBD system for Model Year (MY)
2007. It is probable that EPA (U.S. Federal)
will also follow with a draft in 2004 for subse-
quent introduction in MY 2007. Besides that,
there are initiatives to promote worldwide
harmonization (World Wide Harmonized
(WWH) OBD). However, this is not expected
until 2012. Japan is planning to introduce an
OBD system in 2005. 

EOBD for trucks and buses > 3.5 t
European OBD legislation provides for 
a two-stage introduction. Stage 1 (2005)
 requires monitoring:
(cid:3) of the fuel-injection system for closed 
electrical circuit and total failure.

(cid:3) of emission-related engine components 
or systems for compliance with OBD 
emission limits (Table 1).

(cid:3) of the exhaust-gas treatment system for
major functional faults (e.g. damaged
 catalytic converter, urea deficit in the
SCR system).

Stage 2 (2008) requires:
(cid:3) Monitoring of the exhaust-gas treatment

system for emission limits. 

(cid:3) The OBD emission limits must be adapted
to the prevailing state of the art (availabil-
ity of exhaust-gas sensors).

Protocols for scan-tool communication 
over CAN have been approved using either
ISO 15 765 or SAE J1939. 

CARB OBD for HD trucks > 14,000 lb.
(6.35 t)
The present draft law is very close to passen-
ger-car legislation in its function require-
ments, and also provides for a two-stage
 introduction:
(cid:3) MY 2007: Monitoring for functional faults.
(cid:3) MY 2010: Monitoring for OBD emission

limits (Table 1).

The main changes compared with present
passenger-car legislation are as follows:
(cid:3) Erasing the OBD fault memory by scan

tool is no longer possible. This is only pos-
sible by self-healing (e.g. after repair).
(cid:3) SAE J1939 has also been approved as an al-
ternative to CAN diagnostic communica-
tion to ISO 15 765 (as for passenger cars).

“Once you have driven an automobile, you
will soon realize that there is something
unbelievably tiresome about horses (. . .).
But you do require a conscientious me-
chanic for the automobile (. . .)”.

Robert Bosch wrote these words to his
friend Paul Reusch in 1906. In those days, it
was indeed the case that breakdowns could
be repaired on the road or at home by an em-
ployed chauffeur or mechanic. However, with
the growing number of motorists driving their
own cars after the First World War, the need
for workshops offering repair services in-

creased rapidly. In the 1920s Robert Bosch
started to systematically create a nationwide
customer-service organization. In 1926 all the
repair centers were uniformly named “Bosch
Service” and the name was registered as a
trademark.

Today’s Bosch Service agencies retain the
same name. They are equipped with the latest
electronic equipment in order to meet the de-
mands of 21st-century automotive technology
and the quality expectations of the customers.
