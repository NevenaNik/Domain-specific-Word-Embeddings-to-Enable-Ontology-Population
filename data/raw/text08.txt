Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle

The amount of electronics in the vehicle 
has risen dramatically in recent years 
and is set to increase yet further in the 
future. Technical developments in semi-
conductor technology support ever more 
complex functions with the increasing 
integration density. The functionality of 
electronic systems in motor vehicles has 
now surpassed even the capabilities of 
the Apollo 11 space module that orbited 
the Moon in 1969.

Overview

Development of electronic systems
Not least in contributing to the success of 
the vehicle has been the continuous string 
of innovations which have found their way 
into vehicles. Even as far back as the 1970s, 
the aim was to make use of new technolo-
gies to help in the development of safe, 
clean and economical cars. The pursuit of 
economic efficiency and cleanliness was 
closely linked to other customer benefits

such as driving pleasure. This was charac-
terized by the European diesel boom, upon 
which Bosch had such a considerable influ-
ence. At the same time, the development of 
the gasoline engine with gasoline direct in-
jection, which would reduce fuel consump-
tion by comparison with intake-manifold in-
jection, experienced further advancements.
An improvement in driving safety was 

achieved with electronic brake-control 
systems. In 1978, the antilock brake 
 system (ABS) was introduced and under-
went continual development to such an 
 extent that it is now fitted as standard on 
every vehicle in Europe. It was along this 
same line of development that the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP), in which 
ABS is integrated, would debut in 1995.

The latest developments also take com-

fort into account. These include the hill 
hold control (HHC) function, for example, 
which makes it easier to pull away on up-
hill gradients. This function is integrated 
in ESP.

Many kinds of new functions appear in 
conjunction with driver-assistance sys-
tems. Their scope extends far beyond to-
day’s standard features such as Parkpilot 
or electronic navigation systems. The aim 
is to produce the “sensitive vehicle” that 
uses sensors and electronics to detect and 
interpret its surroundings. Tapping into 
ultrasound, radar and video sensor tech-
nologies has led to solutions that play an 
important role in assisting the driver, e.g. 
through improved night vision or distance 
control.

Value creation structure for the future
The latest studies show that the produc-
tion costs of an average car will increase 
only slightly by 2010 despite further inno-
vations. No significant value growth for 
 existing systems is expected in the me-
chanics/hydraulics domain despite the 
 expected volume growth. One reason  
here being the electrification of functions 
that have conventionally been realized me-
chanically or hydraulically. Brake control 
systems are an impressive example of this 
change. While the conventional brake sys-
tem was characterized more or less com-
pletely by mechanical components, the  
introduction of the ABS brake-control  
system was accompanied by a greater 
 proportion of electronic components in

the form of sensor technology and an 
 electronic control unit. With the more re-
cent developments of ESP, the additional 
functions, such as HHC, are almost exclu-
sively realized by electronics.

Even though significant economies  
of scale are seen with the established 
 solutions, the value of the electrics and 
electronics will increase overall (Fig. 1).  
By 2010, this will amount to a good third of 
the production costs of an average vehicle. 
This assumption is based not least on the 
fact that the majority of future functions 
will also be regulated by electrics and elec-
tronics.

The increase in electrics and electronics 

is associated with a growth in software. 
Even today, software development costs 
are no longer negligible by comparison 
with hardware costs. Software authoring is 
faced with two challenges arising from the 
resulting increase in complexity of a vehi-
cle’s overall system: coping with the vol-
ume and a clearly structured architecture. 
The Autosar initiative (Automotive Open 
Systems Architecture), in which various 
motor vehicle manufacturers and suppli-
ers participate, is working towards a stan-
dardization of electronics architecture 
with the aim of reducing complexity 
through increased reusability and inter-
changeability of software modules.

12  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Overview

Task of an electronic system
Open-loop and closed-loop control
The nerve center of an electronic system is 
the control unit. Figure 3 shows the system 
blocks of a Motronic engine-management 
system. All the open-loop and closed-loop 
algorithms of the electronic system run in-
side the control unit. The heart of the con-
trol unit is a microcontroller with the pro-
gram memory (flash EPROM) in which is 
stored the program code for all functions 
that the control unit is designed to execute.
The input variables for the sequence 
control are derived from the signals from 
sensors and setpoint generators. They in-
fluence the calculations in the algorithms, 
and thus the triggering signals for the ac-
tuators. These convert into mechanical 
variables the electrical signals that are out-
put by the microcontroller and amplified 
in the output stage modules. This could be 
mechanical energy generated by a servo-
motor (power-window unit), for example, 
or thermal energy generated by a 
sheathed-element glow plug. 

3 Function modules of an electronic system

Communication
Many systems have a mutual influence on 
each other. For example, it may sometimes 
be necessary to not only have the elec-
tronic stability program carry out a brak-
ing intervention in the event wheel spin 
but also to request that the engine-man-
agement system reduce torque and thus 
counteract wheel spin. Similarly, the con-
trol unit for the automatic transmission 
outputs a request to the engine-manage-
ment system to reduce torque during a 
gearshift and thereby promote a soft gear 
change. To this end, the systems are net-
worked with each other, i.e. they are able 
to communicate with each other on data 
buses (e.g. CAN, LIN).  

In a premium-class vehicle, there may  
be up to 80 control units performing their 
 duties. The examples below are intended 
to give you an insight into the operating 
principle of these systems.

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Motronic engine-management system  |  13

Motronic engine-manage-
ment system

“Motronic” is the name of an engine-man-
agement system that facilitates open- and 
closed-loop control of gasoline engines 
within a single control unit. 

There are Motronic variants for engines 

with intake-manifold injection (ME Mo-
tronic) and for gasoline direct injection  
(DI Motronic). Another variant is the Bifuel 
Motronic, which also controls the engine 
for operation with natural gas.

System description
Functions 
The primary task of the Motronic engine-
management system is: 
 ▶ To adjust the torque desired and input 

by the driver depressing the accelerator 
pedal

 ▶ To operate the engine in such a way as  

to comply with the requirements of ever 
more stringent emission-control legisla-
tion

 ▶ To ensure the lowest possible fuel con-

sumption but at the same time

 ▶ To guarantee high levels of driving com-

fort and driving pleasure

Components
Motronic comprises all the components 
which control and regulate the gasoline 
engine (Fig. 1, next page). The torque re-
quested by the driver is adjusted by means 
of actuators or converters. The main indi-
vidual components are:
 ▶ The electrically actuated throttle valve 
(air system): this regulates the air-mass 
flow to the cylinders and thus the cylin-
der charge

 ▶ The fuel injectors (fuel system): these 

meter the correct amount of fuel for the 
cylinder charge

 ▶ The ignition coils and spark plugs (igni-
tion system): these provide for correctly 
timed ignition of the air-fuel mixture 
present in the cylinder 

Depending on the vehicle, different measures 
may be required to fulfill the requirements 
demanded of the engine-management sys-
tem (e.g. in respect of emission character-
istics, power output and fuel consump-
tion). Examples of system components 
able to be controlled by Motronic are: 
 ▶ Variable camshaft control: it is possible 
to use the variability of valve timing and 
valve lifts to influence the ratio of fresh 
gas to residual exhaust gas and the mix-
ture formation

 ▶ External exhaust-gas recirculation: 

 adjustment of the residual gas content 
by means of a precise and deliberate 
 return of exhaust gas from the exhaust 
train (adjustment by the exhaust-gas 
 recirculation valve)

 ▶ Exhaust-gas turbocharging: regulated 
supercharging of the combustion air  
(i.e. increase in the fresh air mass in  
the combustion chamber) to increase 
torque

 ▶ Evaporative emission control system:  

for the return of fuel vapors that escape 
from the fuel tank and are collected in 
an activated charcoal canister

Operating variable acquisition
Motronic uses sensors to record the operat-
ing variables required for the open and 
closed-loop control of the engine (e.g. en-
gine speed, engine temperature, battery 
voltage, intake air mass, intake-manifold 
pressure, Lambda value of the exhaust gas).
Setpoint generators (e.g. switches) re-
cord the adjustments made by the driver 
(e.g. position of the ignition key, cruise 
control).

Operating variable processing
From the input signals, the engine ECU  
detects the current operating status of the 
engine and uses this information in con-
junction with requests from auxiliary sys-
tems and from the driver (accelerator-
pedal sensor and operating switches)  
to calculate the command signals for  
the actuators.

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Motronic engine-management system  |  15

In gasoline injection systems with intake 
manifold injection, the fuel is introduced 
into the intake duct upstream of the intake 
valves. To this end, the electric fuel-supply 
pump (27) delivers fuel (primary pressure 
up to approximately 450 kPa) to the fuel 
injectors. Each cylinder is assigned a fuel 
injector that injects the fuel at intermittent 
intervals. The air-fuel mixture in the intake 
passage flows into the cylinder during the 
induction stroke. Corrections are made  
to the injected fuel quantity, e.g. by the 
Lambda control (Lambda oxygen sensor, 
12) and the canister purge (evaporative-
emissions control system, 1, 4).

With gasoline direct injection, fresh air 
flows into the cylinder. The fuel is injected 
directly into the combustion chamber by 
high-pressure fuel injectors (8) where it 
forms an air-fuel mixture with the intake 
air. This requires a higher fuel pressure, 
which is generated by additional high-
pressure pump (7). The pressure can be 
variably adjusted (up to 20 MPa) in line 
with the operating point by an integrated 
fuel-supply control valve.

Air system
A specific air-fuel mixture is required to 
achieve the desired torque. For this pur-
pose, the throttle valve (Fig. 1, Item 3) reg-
ulates the air necessary for the mixture 
formation by adjusting the metering orifice 
in the intake port for the fresh air taken  
in by the cylinders. This is effected by a  
DC motor (Fig. 2) integrated in the throttle 
device that is controlled by the Motronic 
control unit. The position of the throttle 
valve is fed back to the control unit by a 
position sensor to make position control 
possible. This sensor may be in the form  
of a potentiometer, for example. Since the 
throttle device is a component relevant to 
safety, the sensor is designed with redun-
dancy. 

The intake air mass (air charge) is re-
corded by sensors (e.g. hot-film air-mass 
meter, intake-manifold pressure sensor). 

Fuel system
The control unit (Fig. 1, Item 13) calculates 
the fuel volume required from the intake 
air mass and the current operating status 
of the engine (e.g. intake-manifold pres-
sure, engine speed), and also the time at 
which fuel injection should take place.

Fuel injector for intake-manifold 
injection
Function
The electromagnetic (solenoid-controlled) 
fuel injectors spray the fuel into the intake 
manifold at primary pressure. They allow 
fuel to be metered in the precise quantity 
required by the engine. They are actuated 
by driver stages which are integrated in 
the engine ECU with the signal calculated 
by the engine-management system.

3 EV14 electromagnetic fuel injector

Design and operating principle
Essentially, electromagnetic fuel injectors 
(Fig. 3) are comprised of the following 
components: 
▶ Valve housing (3) with electrical connec-

tion (4) and hydraulic port (1)

▶ Solenoid coil (9)
▶ Moving valve needle (10) with solenoid 

armature and valve ball (11) 

▶ Valve seat (12) with injection-orifice 

plate (13) and
▶ Valve spring (8)

In order to ensure trouble-free operation, 
stainless steel is used for the parts of the 
fuel injector which come into contact with 
fuel. The fuel injector is protected against 
dirt by a filter strainer (6) at the fuel inlet.

Connections
On the fuel injectors presently in use,  
fuel supply to the fuel injector is in the 
 axial direction, i.e. from top to bottom 
(“top feed”). The fuel line is secured to  
the hydraulic port by means of a clamping 
fixture. Retaining clips ensure reliable 
 fastening. The sealing ring (O-ring) on  
the hydraulic port (2) seals off the fuel  
injector at the fuel rail.

The fuel injector is electrically con-

nected to the engine ECU.

Fuel injector operation
When the solenoid coil is de-energized, 
the valve needle and valve ball are pressed 
against the cone-shaped valve seat by the 
spring and the force exerted by the fuel 
pressure. The fuel-supply system is thus 
sealed off from the intake manifold. When 
the solenoid coil is energized, this gener-
ates a magnetic field which attracts the 
valve-needle solenoid armature. The valve 
ball lifts up from the valve seat and the fuel 
is injected. When the excitation current is 
switched off, the valve needle closes again 
due to spring force.

tion). The speed at which the valve needle 
lifts off its seat is also dependent on the 
battery voltage. Battery-voltage-depen-
dent injection-duration extension (Fig. 5) 
corrects these influences.

Fuel outlet
The fuel is atomized by means of an injec-
tion-orifice plate in which there are a num-
ber of holes. These holes (injection ori-
fices) are stamped out of the plate and en-
sure that the injected fuel quantity remains 
highly constant. The injection-orifice plate 
is insensitive to fuel deposits. The spray 
pattern of the fuel leaving the injector is 
produced by the number of injection ori-
fices and their configuration. 

The injector is efficiently sealed at the 
valve seat by the cone/ball sealing princi-
ple. The fuel injector is inserted into the 
opening provided for it in the intake mani-
fold. The lower sealing ring provides the 
seal between the fuel injector and the in-
take manifold. 

Essentially, the injected fuel quantity per 
unit of time is determined by 
▶ The primary pressure in the fuel-supply 

system 

fold and 

▶ The back pressure in the intake mani-

▶ The geometry of the fuel-exit area 

Electrical activation
An output module in the Motronic ECU  
actuates the fuel injector with a switching 
signal (Fig. 4a). The current in the solenoid 
coil rises (b) and causes the valve needle 
(c) to lift. The maximum valve lift is 
achieved after the time tpk (pickup time) 
has elapsed. Fuel is sprayed as soon as the 
valve ball lifts off its seat. The total quan-
tity of fuel injected during an injection 
pulse is shown in Figure 4d.

Current flow ceases when activation is 
switched off. Mass inertia causes the valve 
to close, but only slowly. The valve is fully 
closed again after the time tdr (dropout 
time) has elapsed.

When the valve is fully open, the in-
jected fuel quantity is proportional to the 
time. The non-linearity during the valve 
pickup and dropout phases must be com-
pensated for throughout the period that 
the injector is activated (injection dura-

High-pressure fuel injector for 
gasoline direct injection
Function
It is the function of the high-pressure fuel 
injector (HDEV) on the one hand to meter 
the fuel and on the other hand by means of 
its atomization to achieve controlled mix-
ing of the fuel and air in a specific area of 
the combustion chamber. Depending on 
the desired operating status, the fuel is  
either concentrated in the vicinity of the 
spark plug (stratified charge) or evenly 
distributed throughout the combustion 
chamber (homogenous distribution).

Design and operating principle
The high-pressure fuel injector (Fig. 6) 
comprises the following components:
▶ Inlet with filter (1)
▶ Electrical connection (2)
▶ Spring (3)
▶ Coil (4)
▶ Valve sleeve (5)
▶ Nozzle needle with solenoid 

armature (6) and

▶ Valve seat (7)

6 Design of HDEV5 high-pressure fuel injector

A magnetic field is generated when cur-
rent passes through the coil. This lifts the 
valve needle off the valve seat against the 
force of the spring and opens the injector 
outlet bores (8). The primary pressure now 
forces the fuel into the combustion cham-
ber. The injected fuel quantity is essen-
tially dependent on the opening duration 
of the fuel injector and the fuel pressure. 

When the energizing current is switched 

off, the valve needle is pressed by spring 
force back down against its valve seat and 
interrupts the flow of fuel.

Excellent fuel atomization is achieved 
thanks to the suitable nozzle geometry at 
the injector tip. 

Requirements
Compared with manifold injection, gaso-
line direct injection differs mainly in its 
higher fuel pressure and the far shorter 
time which is available for directly inject-
ing the fuel into the combustion chamber.

Figure 7 underlines the technical demands 
made on the fuel injector. In the case of 
manifold injection, two revolutions of the 
crankshaft are available for injecting the 
fuel into the intake manifold. This corre-
sponds to an injection duration of 20 ms  
at an engine speed of 6,000 rpm. 

In the case of gasoline direct injection, 

however, considerably less time is avail-
able. In homogeneous operation, the fuel 
must be injected during the induction 
stroke. In other words, only a half crank-
shaft rotation is available for the injection 
process. At 6,000 rpm, this corresponds to 
an injection duration of 5 ms.

With gasoline direct injection, the fuel 
requirement at idle in relation to that at 
full load is far lower than with manifold 
 injection (factor 1:12). At idle, this results 
in an injection duration of approx. 0.4 ms.

Actuation of HDEV high-pressure  
fuel injector
The high-pressure fuel injector must be 
actuated with a highly complex current 

curve in order to comply with the require-
ments for defined, reproducible fuel-injec-
tion processes (Fig. 8). The microcon-
troller in the engine ECU only delivers  
a digital triggering signal (a). An output 
module (ASIC) uses this signal to generate 
the triggering signal (b) for the fuel injec-
tor. 

A DC/DC converter in the engine ECU 

generates the booster voltage of 65 V.  
This voltage is required in order to bring 
the current up to a high value as quickly  
as possible in the booster phase. This is 
necessary in order to accelerate the injec-
tor needle as quickly as possible. In the 
pickup phase (tpk), the valve needle then 
achieves the maximum opening lift (c). 
When the fuel injector is open, a small 
control current (holding current) is suffi-
cient to keep the fuel injector open. 

With a constant valve-needle displace-
ment, the injected fuel quantity is propor-
tional to the injection duration (d).

Inductive ignition System
Ignition of the air-fuel mixture in the gaso-
line engine is electric; it is produced by 
generating a flashover between the elec-
trodes on a spark plug. The ignition-coil 
energy converted in the spark ignites the 
compressed air-fuel mixture immediately 
adjacent to the spark plug, creating a flame 
front which then spreads to ignite the  
air-fuel mixture in the entire combustion 
chamber. The inductive ignition system 
generates in each power stroke the high 
voltage required for flashover and the 
spark duration required for ignition.  
The electrical energy drawn from the 
 vehicle electrical system is temporarily 
stored in the ignition coil. 

Design
Figure 9 shows the principle layout of  
the ignition circuit of an inductive ignition  
system. It comprises the following compo-
nents: 
 ▶ Ignition driver stage (4), which is inte-
grated in the Motronic ECU or in the  
ignition coil

 ▶ Ignition coils (3)
 ▶ Spark plugs (5) and 
 ▶ Connecting devices and interference 

suppressors

Generating the ignition spark
A magnetic field is built up in the ignition 
coil when a current flows in the primary 
circuit. The ignition energy required for 
ignition is stored in this magnetic field.

The current in the primary winding only 
gradually attains its setpoint value because 
of the induced countervoltage. Because the 
energy stored in the ignition coil is depen-
dent on the current (E = 1/2LI2), a certain 
amount of time (dwell period) is required 
in order to store the energy necessary for 
ignition. This dwell period is dependent 
on, among others, the vehicle system volt-
age. The ECU program calculates from the 
dwell period and the moment of ignition 
the cut-in point, and cuts the ignition coil 
in via the ignition driver stage and out 
again at the moment of ignition.

 Interrupting the coil current at the mo-
ment of ignition causes the magnetic field 
to collapse. This rapid magnetic-field 
change induces a high voltage (Fig. 10)  
on the secondary side of the ignition coil 
as a result of the large number of turns 
(turns ratio approx. 1:100). When the igni-
tion voltage is reached, flashover occurs  
at the spark plug and the compressed  
air-fuel mixture is ignited.

Flame-front propagation
After the flashover, the voltage at the spark 
plug drops to the spark voltage (Fig. 10). 
The spark voltage is dependent on the 
length of the spark plasma (electrode gap 
and deflection due to flow) and ranges be-
tween a few hundred volts and well over 
1 kV. The ignition-coil energy is converted 
in the ignition spark during the combus-
tion time; this ignition spark duration  
lasts from as little as 100 µs to over 2 ms.  
Following the breakaway of the spark,  
the damped voltage decays.

The electrical spark between the spark-
plug electrodes generates a high-tempera-
ture plasma. When the air-fuel mixture at 
the spark plug is ignitable and sufficient 
energy input is supplied by the ignition 
system, the arc that is created develops 
into a self-propagating flame front.

Moment of ignition
The instant at which the ignition spark 
 ignites the air-fuel mixture within the com-
bustion chamber must be selected with 
 extreme precision. This variable has a de-
cisive influence on engine operation and 
determines the output torque, exhaust-gas 
emissions and fuel consumption.

The influencing variables that determine 

the moment of ignition are engine speed 
and engine load, or torque. Additional

variables, such as, for example, engine 
temperature, are also used to determine 
the optimal moment of ignition. These 
variables are recorded by sensors and 
then relayed to the engine ECU (Motronic). 
The moment of ignition is calculated and 
the triggering signal for the ignition driver 
stage is generated from program maps and 
characteristic curves.

Combustion knocks occur if the moment 

of ignition is too advanced. Permanent 
knocking may result in engine damage.  
For this reason, knock sensors are used to 
monitor combustion noise. After a com-
bustion knock, the moment of ignition is 
delayed to too late and then slowly moved 
back to the pilot control value. This helps 
to counteract permanent knocking.

 

Voltage distribution 
Voltage distribution takes place on the pri-
mary side of the ignition coils, which are 
directly connected to the spark plugs 
(static voltage distribution). 

System with single-spark ignition coils
Each cylinder is allocated an ignition 
driver stage and an ignition coil (Figs. 11a 
and 11b). The engine ECU actuates the  
ignition driver stages in specified firing  
order. However, the system does also have 
to be synchronized with the camshaft by 
means of a camshaft sensor. 

System with dual-spark ignition coils
One ignition driver stage and one ignition 
coil are allocated to every two cylinders 
(Fig. 11c). The ends of the secondary wind-
ing are each connected to a spark plug in 
different cylinders. The cylinders have 
been chosen so that when one cylinder is 
in the compression cycle, the other is in 
the exhaust cycle (only possible with en-
gines with an even number of cylinders).  
It does not therefore need to be synchro-
nized with the camshaft. Flashover occurs 
at both spark plugs at the moment of igni-
tion.

Ignition coils
Compact ignition coil
Design
The compact coil’s magnetic circuit con-
sists of the O core and the I core (Fig. 12), 
onto which the primary and secondary 
windings are plugged. This arrangement is 
installed in the coil housing. The primary 
winding (I core wound in wire) is electri-
cally and mechanically connected to the 
primary plug connection. Also connected 
is the start of the secondary winding (coil 
body wound in wire). The connection on 
the spark-plug side of the secondary wind-
ing is also located in the housing, and elec-
trical contacting is established when the 
windings are fitted.

Integrated within the housing is the high-
voltage contact dome. This contains the 
contact section for spark-plug contacting, 
and also a silicone jacket for insulating the 
high voltage from external components 
and the spark-plug well. 

Following component assembly resin  
is vacuum-injected into the inside of the 
housing, where it is allowed to harden. 
This produces high mechanical strength, 
good protection from environmental influ-
ences and outstanding insulation of the 
high voltage. The silicone jacket is then 
pushed onto the high-voltage contact 
dome for permanent attachment.

Remote and COP versions
The ignition coil’s compact dimensions 
make it possible to implement the design 
shown in Figure 12. This version is called 
COP (Coil On Plug). The ignition coil is 
mounted directly on the spark plug, 
thereby rendering additional high-voltage 
connecting cables superfluous. This re-
duces the capacitive load on the ignition 
coil’s secondary circuit. The reduction in 
the number of components also increases 
operational reliability (no rodent bites in 
ignition cables, etc.).

In the less common remote version,  
the compact coils are mounted within the 
engine compartment using screws. Attach-
ment lugs or an additional bracket are pro-
vided for this purpose. The high-voltage 
connection is effected by means of a high-
voltage ignition cable from the ignition coil 
to the spark plug.

The COP and remote versions are 
 virtually identical in design. However,  
the remote version (mounted on the vehi-
cle body) is subject to fewer demands with  
regard to temperature and vibration con-
ditions due to the fact that it is exposed to 
fewer loads and strains.

Pencil coil
The pencil coil makes optimal use of the 
space available within the engine compart-
ment. Its cylindrical shape makes it possi-
ble to use the spark plug well as a supple-
mentary installation area for ideal space 
utilization on the cylinder head.

Because pencil coils are always mounted 

directly on the spark plug, no additional 
high-voltage connecting cables are re-
quired.

13 Design of pencil coil

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Motronic engine-management system  |  23

Design and magnetic circuit
Pencil coils operate like compact coils in 
accordance with the inductive principle. 
However, the rotational symmetry results 
in a design structure that differs consider-
ably from that of compact coils. 

Although the magnetic circuit consists 
of the same materials, the central rod core 
(Fig. 13, Item 5) consists of laminations in 
various widths stacked in packs that are 
virtually circular. The yoke plate (9) that 
provides the magnetic circuit is a rolled 
and slotted sleeve – also in electrical sheet 
steel, sometimes in multiple layers.

Another difference relative to compact 
coils is the primary winding (7), which has 
a larger diameter and is above the second-
ary winding (6), while the body of the 
winding also supports the rod core.  
This arrangement brings significant bene-
fits in the areas of design and operation.
Owing to restrictions imposed by their 
geometrical configuration and compact di-
mensions, pencil coils allow only limited 
scope for varying the magnetic circuit  
(rod core, yoke plate) and windings. 

In most pencil-coil applications, the lim-

ited space available dictates that perma-
nent magnets be used to increase the 
spark energy. 

The arrangements for electrical contact 
with the spark plug and for connection to 
the engine wiring harness are comparable 
with those used for compact pencil coils.

Electronic diesel control 
(EDC)

System overview
Electronic control of a diesel engine en-
ables precise and differentiated modula-
tion of fuel-injection parameters. This is 
the only means by which a modern diesel 
engine is able to satisfy the many demands 
placed upon it. Electronic diesel control 
(EDC) is subdivided into three system 
blocks: sensors/setpoint generators, ECU, 
and actuators.

Requirements
The lowering of fuel consumption and ex-
haust emissions (NOX, CO, HC, particulates) 
combined with simultaneous improvement 
of engine power output and torque are the 
guiding principles of current development 
work on diesel-engine design. Conventional 
indirect-injection engines (IDI) were no 
longer able to satisfy these requirements. 
State-of-the-art technology is repre-
sented today by direct-injection diesel en-
gines (DI) with high injection pressures for 
efficient mixture formation. The fuel-injec-
tion systems support several injection pro-
cesses: pre-injection, main injection, and 
secondary injection. These injection pro-

1 EDC system blocks 

cesses are for the most part controlled 
electronically (pre-injection, however, is 
controlled mechanically on UIS for cars).

In addition, diesel-engine development 

has been influenced by the high levels of 
driving comfort and convenience de-
manded in modern cars. Exhaust and 
noise emissions are also subject to ever 
more stringent demands.

As a result, the performance demanded 
of the fuel-injection and management sys-
tems has also increased, specifically with 
regard to:
 ▶ High injection pressures
 ▶ Rate shaping
 ▶ Pre-injection and, if necessary, second-

ary injection

 ▶ Adaptation of injected fuel quantity, 
boost pressure and start of injection  
at the respective operating status
 ▶ Temperature-dependent excess-fuel 

quantity

 ▶ Load-independent idle speed control
 ▶ Controlled exhaust-gas recirculation
 ▶ Cruise control
 ▶ Tight tolerances for start of injection and 
injected-fuel quantity and maintenance 
of high precision over the service life of 
the system (long-term performance)

 ▶ Support of exhaust-gas treatment

Conventional mechanical RPM control 
uses a number of adjusting mechanisms  
to adapt to different engine operating sta-
tuses and ensures high-quality mixture 
formation. Nevertheless, it is restricted to 
a simple engine-based control loop and 
there are a number of important influenc-
ing variables that it cannot take account of 
or cannot respond quickly enough to.

As demands have increased, EDC has de-

veloped into a complex electronic engine-
management system capable of processing 
large amounts of data in real time. In addi-
tion to its pure engine-management func-
tion, EDC supports a series of comfort and 
convenience functions (e.g. cruise control). 
It can form part of an overall electronic ve-
hicle-speed control system (“drive-by-
wire”). And as a result of the  increasing in-
tegration of electronic components, com-
plex electronics can be accommodated in a 
very small space.

Operating principle
Electronic diesel control (EDC) is capable 
of meeting the requirements listed above 
as a result of microcontroller performance 
that has improved considerably in the last 
few years. 

In contrast to diesel-engine vehicles 
with conventional in-line or distributor 
 injection pumps, the driver of an EDC-
 controlled vehicle has no direct influence, 
for instance through the accelerator pedal 
and Bowden cable, upon the injected fuel 
quantity. Instead, the injected fuel quantity 
is determined by a number of influencing 
variables. These include:
 ▶ Driver command (accelerator-pedal  

position)

 ▶ Operating status
 ▶ Engine temperature
 ▶ Interventions by other systems  

(e.g. TCS)

 ▶ Effects on exhaust emissions, etc.

The ECU calculates the injected fuel quan-
tity on the basis of all these influencing 
variables. Start of injection can also be var-

ied. This requires a comprehensive moni-
toring concept that detects inconsistencies 
and initiates appropriate actions in accor-
dance with the effects (e.g. torque limita-
tion or limp-home mode in the idle-speed 
range). EDC therefore incorporates a num-
ber of control loops.

Electronic diesel control allows data 

communication with other electronic 
 systems, such as the traction-control 
 system (TCS), electronic transmission 
 control (ETC), or electronic stability pro-
gram (ESP). As a result, the engine-man-
agement system can be integrated in the 
vehicle’s overall control system, thereby 
enabling functions such as reduction of 
engine torque when the automatic trans-
mission changes gear, regulation of engine 
torque to compensate for wheel slip, etc. 

The EDC system is fully integrated in the 

vehicle’s diagnosis system. It meets all 
OBD (On-Board Diagnosis) and EOBD  
(European OBD) requirements.

System blocks
Electronic diesel control (EDC) is divided 
into three system blocks (Fig. 1):

1. Sensors and setpoint generators detect 
operating conditions (e.g. engine speed) 
and setpoint values (e.g. switch position). 
They convert physical variables into elec-
trical signals.

2. The ECU processes the information 
from the sensors and setpoint generators 
in mathematical computing processes 
(open- and closed-loop control algo-
rithms). It controls the actuators by means 
of electrical output signals. In addition, the 
ECU acts as an interface to other systems 
and to the vehicle diagnosis system.

3. Actuators convert the electrical output 
signals from the ECU into mechanical vari-
ables (e.g. solenoid-valve needle lift).

26  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Electronic diesel control (EDC)

Data processing
The main function of the electronic diesel 
control (EDC) is to control the injected fuel 
quantity and the injection timing. The 
common-rail accumulator injection system 
also controls injection pressure. Further-
more, on all systems, the engine ECU con-
trols a number of actuators. The EDC func-
tions must be matched to every vehicle 
and every engine. This is the only way to 
optimize component interaction (Fig. 3).

The control unit evaluates the signals sent 
by the sensors and limits them to the per-
mitted voltage level. Some input signals 
are also checked for plausibility. Using this 
input data together with stored program 
maps, the microprocessor calculates the 
position and duration for injection timing. 
This information is then converted to a sig-
nal characteristic which is aligned to the 
engine’s piston strokes. This calculation 
program is termed the “ECU software”.

The required degree of accuracy together 
with the diesel engine’s outstanding dy-
namic response requires high-level com-
puting power. The output signals are  
applied to driver stages which provide  
adequate power for the actuators (for in-
stance, the high-pressure solenoid valves 
for fuel injection, exhaust-gas recircula-
tion positioner, or boost-pressure actua-
tor). Apart from this, a number of other 
auxiliary-function components (e.g. glow 
relay and air-conditioning system) are 
 triggered.

The driver-stage diagnosis functions for 
the solenoid valves also detect faulty sig-
nal characteristics. Furthermore, signals 
are exchanged with other systems in the 
vehicle via the interfaces. The engine ECU 
monitors the complete fuel-injection sys-
tem as part of a safety strategy.

Table 1 provides an overview of the EDC 
functions which are implemented in the 
various fuel-injection systems. Figure 4 
shows the sequence of fuel-injection calcu-
lations with all functions, a number of 
which are optional extras. These can be 
activated in the ECU by the after-sales ser-
vice when retrofit equipment is installed. 

In order that the engine can run with opti-
mal combustion under all operating condi-
tions, the ECU calculates exactly the right 
injected fuel quantity for all conditions. 
Here, a number of parameters must be 
taken into account. On a number of sole-

jection pumps, the solenoid valves for in-
jected fuel quantity and start of injection 
are triggered by a separate pump ECU.

30  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Electronic diesel control (EDC)

Torque-controlled EDC systems
The engine-management system is continu-
ally being integrated more closely into the 
overall vehicle system. Vehicle-dynamics 
systems (e.g. TCS), comfort and conve-
nience systems (e.g. cruise control/Tempo-
mat), and transmission control influence 
electronic diesel control (EDC) via the  
CAN bus. Apart from this, much of the in-
formation registered or calculated in the 
engine-management system must be passed 
on to other ECUs via the CAN bus.

In order to be able to incorporate EDC 
even more efficiently in a functional alli-
ance with other ECUs, and implement 
other changes rapidly and effectively,  
it was necessary to make radical changes 
to the newest-generation controls. These 
changes resulted in torque-controlled 
EDC, which was introduced with the 
EDC16. The main feature is the changeover 
of the module interfaces to the parameters 
as commonly encountered in practice in 
the vehicle.

Engine characteristics
Essentially, an engine’s output can be  
defined using the three characteristics: 
power P, engine speed n, and torque M. 
Figure 5 compares typical curves of 
torque and power as a function of the en-
gine speed of two diesel engines. Basically 
speaking, the following formula applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

It is sufficient therefore, for example, to 
specify the torque as the reference vari-
able while taking into account the engine 
speed. Engine power then results from the 
above formula. Since power output cannot 
be measured directly, torque has turned 
out to be a suitable reference variable for 
engine management.

 demand a given torque from the engine.  
Independently of the driver’s require-
ments, other external vehicle systems sub-
mit torque demands via the interfaces re-
sulting from the power requirements of 
the particular component (e.g. air-condi-
tioning system, alternator). Using these 
torque-requirement inputs, the engine-
management system calculates the output 
engine torque to be generated and con-
trols the fuel-injection and air-system ac-
tuators accordingly. This has the following 
advantages:
 ▶ No system has a direct influence on en-
gine management (boost pressure, fuel 
injection, preglow). The engine manage-
ment system can thus also take into ac-
count other higher-level optimization 
criteria for the external requirements  
(e.g. exhaust-gas emissions, fuel con-
sumption) and then control the engine 
in the best way possible.

 ▶ Many of the functions which do not di-
rectly concern the engine management 
system can be designed to function iden-
tically for diesel and gasoline engines.
 ▶ Expansions to the system can be imple-

mented quickly.

Sequence of engine management
The setpoint values are processed further 
in the engine ECU. In order to fulfill their 
assignments efficiently, the engine manage-
ment system’s control functions all require 
a wide range of sensor signals and informa-
tion from other ECUs in the vehicle.

Propulsion torque
The driver’s input (i.e. the signal from the 
accelerator-pedal sensor) is interpreted  
by the engine management system as the 
request for a propulsion torque. The in-
puts from the cruise control and the vehi-
cle-speed limiter are processed in exactly 
the same manner. 

Following this selection of the desired 

propulsive torque, should the situation 
arise, the vehicle-dynamics system (TCS, 
ESP) increases the desired torque value 
when there is the danger of wheel lockup 
and decreases it when the wheels show a 
tendency to spin. 

Further external torque demands
The drivetrain’s torque adaptation must be 
taken into account (drivetrain transmission 
ratio). This is defined for the most part by 
the ratio of the particular gear, or by the 
torque-converter efficiency in the case of 
automatic transmissions. On vehicles with 
an automatic transmission, the transmis-
sion control stipulates the torque demand 
during the gearshift. This is reduced in or-
der to produce a comfortable, smooth gear-
shift, thus protecting the engine. In addi-
tion, the torque required by other engine-
powered auxiliary systems (e.g. air-con- 
ditioning compressor, alternator, servo 
pump) is determined. This torque demand 
is calculated either by the auxiliary sys-
tems themselves or by the engine manage-
ment system. Calculation is based on the 
required power and engine speed, and the 
engine management system adds up the 
various torque requirements. 

The vehicle’s driveability remains un-
changed notwithstanding varying require-

ments from the auxiliary systems and 
changes in the engine’s operating states.

Internal torque demands
At this stage, the idle-speed control and 
the active surge damper intervene.

For instance, if demanded by the situa-
tion, in order to prevent mechanical dam-
age, or excessive smoke due to the injec-
tion of too much fuel, the torque limitation 
reduces the internal torque demand. In 
contrast to previous engine-management 
systems, limitations are no longer only ap-
plied to the injected fuel quantity, but in-
stead, depending on the required effects, 
also to the particular physical quantity in-
volved.

The engine’s losses are also taken into 
account (e.g. friction, drive for the high-
pressure pump). The torque represents 
the engine’s measurable effects to the out-
side. However, the engine management 
system can only generate these effects in 
conjunction with the correct fuel injection 
together with the correct injection point, 
and the necessary marginal conditions as 
apply to the air system (e.g. boost pressure 
and exhaust-gas recirculation rate). The 
required injected fuel quantity is deter-
mined using the current combustion effi-
ciency. The calculated fuel quantity is lim-
ited by a protective function (e.g. protec-
tion against overheating), and if necessary 
can be varied by smooth-running control. 
During engine start, the injected fuel quan-
tity is not determined by external inputs 
such as those from the driver, but rather 
by the separate “start quantity” control 
function.

Actuator triggering
The resulting setpoint value for the in-
jected fuel quantity is used to generate the 
triggering data for the injection pumps 
and/or the fuel injectors, and for defining 
the optimum operating point for the in-
take-air system.

Lighting technology

Automotive light sources
The most important light sources for the 
lighting systems on the vehicle front and 
rear are halogen lamps, bulbs, gas-dis-
charge lamps and LEDs.

Thermal radiators
Thermal radiators generate light from heat 
energy. The major liability of the thermal 
radiator is its low working efficiency (be-
low 10 %) which, relative to the gas-dis-
charge lamp, leads to very low potential 
for luminous efficiency.

Incandescent (vacuum) bulb
Among the thermal radiators is the bulb 
(Fig. 1) whose tungsten filament (2) is en-
closed by glass (1). A vacuum is created in-
side the glass, which is why the incandes-
cent bulb is also known as a vacuum bulb.

At 10 to 18 lm/W (lumen/Watt), the lumi-
nous efficiency of an incandescent bulb is 
comparatively low. During bulb operation, 
the tungsten particles of the filament va-
porize. The glass consequently darkens 
over the course of the bulb’s service life. 
The vaporization of the particles ulti-
mately leads to the filament breaking and 
thus failure of the lamp. For this reason, 

incandescent bulbs as light sources for  
the headlamps have been replaced by hal-
ogen lamps. For cost reasons, however, in-
candescent bulbs continue to be used for 
other lights and as light sources in the pas-
senger compartment. Even the lighting of 
passive display elements (e.g. fan, heating 
and air-conditioning controllers, LCD dis-
plays) is generally performed by incandes-
cent bulbs, the color of which is changed 
by means of color filters for the applica-
tion and design concerned.

Halogen lamp
There are two types of halogen lamp:  
with one or two tungsten filaments. The 
halogen lamps H1, H3, H7, HB3 and HB4 
(see table at the end of the chapter) only 
have one filament. They are used as light 
sources for the low-beam, high-beam and 
fog lights. 

The bulb is made of quartz glass.  
The quartz glass filters out the low UV 
content of the beam that halogen lamps 
emit. Unlike an incandescent bulb, the 
glass of a halogen lamp contains a halogen 
charge (iodine or bromine). This makes it 
possible for the filament to heat up to tem-
peratures approaching tungsten’s melting 
point (around 3,400 °C), thereby achieving 
commensurately high levels of luminous 
power.

Close to the hot bulb wall, vaporized tung-
sten particles combine with the filler gas to 
form a transparent gas (tungsten halide). 
This is stable within a temperature range 
of approximately 200 to 1,400  °C. Tung-
sten particles re-approaching the filament 
respond to the high temperatures at the 
filament by dispersing to form a consistent 
tungsten layer. This cycle (Fig. 2) limits the 
wear rate of the filament. In order to main-
tain this cycle, an external bulb tempera-
ture of approx. 300 °C is necessary. The 
glass therefore encloses the filament 
tightly. It remains clear throughout the 
 entire service life of the lamp. 

The rate of filament wear is also limited 

by the high pressure that is generated in 
the bulb, limiting the vaporization rate of 
the tungsten. 

The H4 halogen lamp generates the light 
beam in the same way but has two fila-
ments (Fig. 3, Items 2 and 3). This means 

3 H4 halogen lamp 

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Lighting technology  |  33

that only one lamp is required for each 
low-beam and high-beam headlamp. 

The lower part of the low-beam filament 

is masked by a screen integrated in the 
headlamp. As a result, the light is only 
emitted into the upper part of the reflector 
(Fig. 8) and thereby prevents dazzling 
other road users.

Switching from low beam to high beam 

activates the second filament. Halogen 
lamps with an output of 60/55 W1) emit 
around twice as much light as incandes-
cent bulbs with an output of 45/40 W.  
The high luminous efficiency of around  
22 to 26 lm/W is primarily the result of  
the high filament temperature.

Gas-discharge lamps
Gas discharge describes the electrical dis-
charge that occurs when an electrical cur-
rent flows through a gas and causes it to 
emit radiation (examples: sodium-vapor 
lamps for street lighting and fluorescent 
lamps for interior lighting).

The discharge chamber of the gas-dis-
charge lamp (Fig. 4, Item 3) is filled with 
the  inert gas xenon and a mixture of metal 
 halides. The electrical voltage is applied 
between two electrodes (4) protruding  
into the bulb. An electronic ballast unit is 
required for switching on and operation. 
 Application of an ignition voltage in the  
10 to 20 kV range ionizes the gas between 
the electrodes, producing an electrically 
conductive path in the form of a luminous 
arc. With the alternating current (400 Hz) 
applied, the metallic charge is vaporized 
due to the temperature increase inside the 
bulb and light is radiated.

Under normal circumstances the lamp re-
quires several seconds to ionize all of the 
particles and generate full illumination.  
To accelerate this process, an increased 
starting current flows until this point.

When maximum luminous power is 
achieved, limitation of lamp current com-
mences. A sustained operating voltage of 
only 85 V is sufficient to maintain the arc.
Light sources relying on the gas-dis-
charge concept acquired new significance 
for automotive applications with the ad-
vent of the “Litronic” electronic lighting 
system. This concept features several cru-
cial benefits compared with conventional 
bulbs:
 ▶ Greater range of the headlamp beam
 ▶ Brighter and more even carriageway

front-end styling

The D2/D4-series automotive gas-dis-
charge lamps feature high-voltage-proof 
sockets and UV glass shielding elements. 
On the D1/D3-series models, the high-volt-
age electronics necessary for operation 
are also integrated in the lamp socket.  
All series can be broken down into two 
subcategories:
 ▶ Standard lamp (S lamp) for projection 

 ▶ Reflection lamp (R lamp) for reflection 
headlamps (Fig. 5). They have an inte-
grated shutter (3) to create the light-
dark cutoff, comparable with the shutter 
in the H4 lamp.

Until now, gas-discharge lamps with the 
type designations D1x and D2x were used. 
From 2007, the D3/D4-series will also be 
fitted as standard. These have a lower 
 operating voltage, a different charge gas 
composition, and different arc geometries.

Light emitting diodes
The light emitting diode (LED) is an active 
light element. If an electrical voltage is ap-
plied, current flows through the chip. The 
electrons of the atoms of the LED chip are 
highly energized by the voltage. As light is 
emitted, they return to their initial state of 
low energy charge. 

The 0.1 to 1 mm small semiconductor crys-
tal is seated on a reflector that directs the 
light with pin-point precision.

LEDs are commonly used as light 

sources for lights on the rear of the vehi-
cle, especially the additional stop lamps 
located in the center. They make it possi-
ble for a narrow, linear beam to be emitted.

By comparison with incandescent bulbs, 
LEDs are beneficial in that they emit maxi-
mum output in less than a millisecond.  
An incandescent bulb takes approximately 
200 ms. LEDs, for example, are therefore 
able to emit the brake signal sooner and 
thus shorten the response time to the 
brake signal (brake pedal depressed)  
for drivers behind.

In the motor vehicle, LEDs are used as illu-
minators or in displays, in the interior they 
are used for lighting, in displays or display 
backlighting. In the lighting system, they 
find use as auxiliary stop lamps and tail 
lamps, and, increasingly in future, as day-
time running lamps and in headlamps.

▶ Technical lighting variables

Luminous intensity
The brightness of light sources can vary. 
Luminous intensity serves as an index 
for comparing them. It is the visible light 
radiation that a light source projects in a 
specific direction. 

The unit for defining levels of luminous 
intensity is the candela (cd), roughly 
equivalent to the illumination emitted  
by one candle. The brightness of an 
 illuminated surface varies according to  
its reflective properties, the luminous  
intensity and the distance separating  
it from the light source. 

Examples of permissible values
Stop lamp (individual): 60 to 185 cd
Tail lamp (individual): 4 to 12 cd
Rear fog lamp (individual): 150 to 300 cd
High beam (total, maximum): 225,000 cd

Luminous flux
Luminous flux is that light emitted by a 
light source that falls within the visible 
wavelength range. 
Values are expressed in lumen (lm). 

Illuminance
The illuminance is the luminous flux ar-
riving at a given surface. It increases 
proportionally along with the light inten-
sity, and decreases with the square of 
the distance. 

Illuminance is expressed in lux (lx):
1 lx = 1 lm/m2

Range
The range is defined as the distance at 
which the illuminance in the light beam 
still has a given value (e.g. 1 lx). The 
geometric range is the distance at which 
the horizontal part of the light-dark cut-
off is shown on the road surface with 
the headlamps on low beam. 

36  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Lighting technology

Main headlamps (Europe)
Function
On the one hand, the main headlamps must 
provide maximum visual range while at the 
same time ensuring that the glare effect for 
oncoming traffic is kept to a minimum and 
that light distribution immediately in front 
of the vehicle remains in line with the re-
quirements of safe operation. It is vital to 
provide the lateral illumination needed to 
safely negotiate bends, i.e. the light must 
extend outward to embrace the verge of 
the road. Although it is impossible to 
achieve absolutely consistent luminance 
across the entire road surface, it is possible 
to avoid sharp contrasts in light density.

High beam
The high beam is usually generated by a 
light source located at the reflector’s focal 
point, causing the light to be reflected out-
ward along a plane extending along the re-
flector’s axis (Fig. 7). The maximum lumi-
nous intensity which is available during 
high-beam operation is largely a function 
of the reflector’s mirrored surface area. 

In four and six-headlamp systems, in par-
ticular, purely parabolic high-beam reflec-
tors can be replaced by units with complex 
geometrical configurations for simultane-
ous use of high and low beams.

In these systems the high-beam compo-
nent is designed to join with the low beam 
(simultaneous operation) to produce a 
harmonious overall high-beam distribu-
tion pattern. This strategy abolishes the 
annoying overlapping sector that would 
otherwise be present at the front of the 
light pattern.

Low beam (dipped beam)
The high traffic density on modern roads 
severely restricts the use of high-beam 
headlamps. The low beams serve as the 
primary source of light under normal 
 conditions. Basic design modifications 
 implemented within recent years are 
 behind the substantial improvements in 
low-beam performance. Developments 
have included:
 ▶ Introduction of the asymmetrical low-

beam pattern, characterized (RHD traf-
fic) by an extended visual range along 
the right side of the road.

 ▶ Introduction of new headlamp systems 
featuring complex geometrical configu-
rations (PES1), free-form surfaces2), fac-
etted reflectors3)) offering efficiency-
level improvements of up to 50 %.

 ▶ Headlamp leveling control (also known 
as vertical aim control) devices adapt 
the attitude of the headlamps to avoid 
dazzling oncoming traffic when the rear

Six-headlamp systems differ from the quad 
configuration by incorporating a supple-
mentary fog lamp within the main head-
lamp assembly (Fig. 9 c).

Main headlamps (North America)
High beam
The designs for high-beam headlamps are 
the same as in Europe. Facetted reflectors 
with, for example, HB5 or H7 lamps are 
used. 

Low beam (dipped beam)
Headlamps with a light-dark cutoff that 
rely on visual/optical adjustment proce-
dures have been approved in the USA 
since 1 May, 1997. This has made it possi-
ble to equip vehicles for Europe and the 
USA with headlamps of the same type and, 
in some cases, even the same reflectors.

Regulations
The regulations for the attachment and 
wiring of main headlamps are comparable 
with the European regulations (Federal 
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 
No. 108 and SAE Ground Vehicle Lighting 
Standards Manual). 

An amendment to FMVSS 108 that en-

tered effect in 1983 made it possible to 
start using headlamp units of various 
shapes and sizes with replaceable bulbs. 
These were known as the RBH, or Replace-
able Bulb Headlamps.

Headlamp systems
North America mirrors European practice 
in employing dual, quad and six-headlamp 
systems.

of the vehicle is heavily laden. Vehicles 
must also be equipped with headlamp 
washer systems.

 ▶ “Litronic” gas-discharge lamps supply 
more than twice as much light as con-
ventional halogen lamps.

Operating concept
Low-beam headlamps need a light-dark 
cutoff in the light pattern. In the case of  
H4 halogen headlamps and Litronic head-
lamps with D2R bulbs, this is achieved by 
the image from the shield (H4) or the shut-
ter (D2R). On headlamps for all-round use 
(H1-, H7-, HB11 bulbs), the light-dark cut-
off is achieved by the special imaging of 
the filament.

Headlamp systems
Dual-headlamp systems rely on a single 
shared reflector for low- and high-beam 
operation, e.g. in combination with a dual-
filament H4 bulb (Fig. 9 a).

In quad headlamp systems one pair of 
headlamps may be switched on in both 
modes or during low-beam operation only, 
while the other pair is operated exclu-
sively for high-beam use (Fig. 9 b).

Litronic
Overview
The “Litronic” (Light-Electronics) head-
lamp system uses xenon gas-discharge 
lamps that produce a powerful lighting 
 effect despite the low front-end surface 
area requirement. The illumination of the 
carriageway represents a substantial im-
provement over that provided by conven-
tional halogen units (Fig. 10).

For low beam, the headlamps with xenon 
gas-discharge lamps are installed in a quad 
system that is combined with the high-
beam headlamps of the conventional 
 design. 

With the Bi-Litronic system, however, 
the low and high beams are generated by 
only one gas-discharge lamp from a dual-
headlamp system. 

The light generated contains a higher 
proportion of green and blue and is thus 
more similar to the spectral distribution of 
sunlight. Night-time driving is therefore 
less exacting for the driver.

An integral part of the headlamp is the 
electronic ballast unit responsible for 
 activating and monitoring the lamp.  
Its functions include:
 ▶ Ignition of the gas discharge  

Design
The components of the Litronic headlamp 
system are:
 ▶ Optical unit with xenon gas-discharge 
lamp (S lamp, R lamp; see “Gas-dis-
charge lamps” section) 

 ▶ Electronic ballast unit with igniter and 

ECU

10 Light pattern on the road (comparison)

(voltage 10 to 20 kV)

 ▶ Regulated power supply during the  

warm-up phase when the lamp is cold
 ▶ Demand-oriented supply in continuous 

operation

The control units for the individual lamp 
types are generally developed for a spe-
cific design type and are not universally 
interchangeable. 

Operating principle
In the gas-discharge lamp, the arc is ig-
nited when the light is switched on. A high 
voltage of 18 to 20 kV is required for this 
to be possible. 85 V are required to main-
tain the arc after ignition. The voltage is 
generated and regulated by an electronic

Bi-Litronic “Reflection”
The “Reflection” Bi-Litronic system makes 
it possible to generate the low and high 
beams using only one gas-discharge lamp 
(DR2 lamp) from a dual-headlamp system. 
The concept relies on an electromechani-
cal positioner that responds to the high/
low-beam switch by varying the attitude  
of the gas-discharge lamp within the re-
flector. lt alternates between two different 
positions to generate separate projection 
patterns for low and high beam (Fig. 12).

ballast unit (igniter, Fig. 11). After ignition, 
the gas-discharge lamp is operated for ap-
proximately 3 secs with an elevated start-
ing current (approximately 2.6 A) so that  
it achieves maximum luminosity with mini-
mal delay. The bulb’s output in this period 
is anywhere up to 75 W. During continu-
ous-running operation, it is 35 W.

The maximum luminous efficiency of ap-
proximately 90 lm/W is achieved once the 
plasma has heated the quartz glass to ap-
proximately 900  °C. Once the gas-discharge 
lamp has achieved maximum luminosity, 
the ballast unit reduces the current output 
to the bulb to approximately 0.4 A for con-
tinuous-running operation.

Fluctuations in the vehicle system voltage 
are for the most part compensated for by 
the ballast unit to prevent luminous flux 
variations. If the bulb goes out, e.g. due  
to an extreme voltage drop (below 9 V) or 
increase (above 16.5 V) in the vehicle elec-
trical system, it is automatically reignited 
without delay. The reignition is limited  
to five attempts for safety reasons. The 
power supply is then interrupted by the 
ballast unit.

Bi-Litronic “Projection”
The Bi-Litronic “Projection” system is 
based on a PES Litronic headlamp. It shifts 
the position of the shutter for the light-
dark cutoff to provide xenon light for  
high-beam operation.

With lens diameters of 60 and 70 mm, 

the Bi-Litronic “Projection” is the most 
compact combined low- and high-beam 
headlamp on the market, yet it still pro-
vides superb illumination.

The essential advantages of the Bi-Litronic 
“Projection” are: 
 ▶ Xenon light for high-beam operation
 ▶ Most compact solution for high and  

low beams 

 ▶ Modular system

Headlamp leveling control
Function
Without headlamp leveling control, the 
range of the headlamps would alter with a 
change in load or operating condition of 
the vehicle (constant-speed travel, station-
ary, acceleration, braking). The headlamp 
leveling control adjusts the tilt angle of the 
low beam to the tilt angle of the vehicle 
body. This results in a permanently good 
visual range with no dazzling of oncoming 
traffic under all load conditions. 

 ▶ Substantial reduction in space require-
ments as compared to a conventional 
quad headlamp system

 ▶ Lower costs through the use of just one 
gas-discharge bulb and one ballast unit 
per headlamp

 ▶ Greater freedom in headlamp design 
due to the individual reflector shape.

Special design variants of the Bi-Litronic 
“Reflection” lamp involve solutions in 
which the entire reflector is moved or indi-
vidual components of the bulb cover are 
opened.

Designs
All headlamp leveling controls feature ac-
tuators that move the headlamp reflector 
(housing-type design) or headlamp unit  
up and down. Automatic systems rely on 
sensors that monitor suspension travel as 
the basis for generating proportional sig-
nals for transmission to the aiming actua-
tors. Manually operated units employ a 
switch near the driver’s seat to control the 
setting.

Automatic headlamp leveling control
Automatic headlamp-leveling control sys-
tems fall into two categories: static and dy-
namic. While static systems compensate 
for load variations in the luggage and pas-
senger compartments, dynamic systems 
also correct headlamp aim during acceler-
ation – both from standing starts and when 
underway – and when braking. 

The components of a typical headlamp-

leveling control system include (Fig. 16):
 ▶ Sensors on the vehicle axles (Items 3 

and 6) to measure the body’s inclination 
or tilt angle.

 ▶ An ECU (5) that uses the sensor signals 
as the basis for calculating the vehicle’s 
pitch angle. The ECU compares this data 
with the specified values and responds 
to deviations by transmitting appropri-
ate triggering signals to the headlamps’ 
servomotors.

 ▶ Servomotors (2) to adjust the headlamps 

to the correct angle.

Static system
In addition to the signals from the suspen-
sion sensors, the static system’s control 
unit also receives a speed signal from the 
electronic speedometer. The controller 
 relies on this signal to decide whether the 
vehicle is stationary, undergoing a dy-
namic change in speed, or proceeding at a 
constant speed. Automatic systems based 
on the static concept always feature sub-
stantial response inertia, so the system 
corrects only those vehicle inclinations 
that are consistently registered over rela-
tively long periods. 

Each time the vehicle has pulled away,  
it corrects the headlamp adjustment as a 
function of the vehicle’s load. This adjust-
ment is checked again when the vehicle 
steadies into constant-speed travel and  
is then corrected if necessary. Deviations 
between the target and actual position  
are evened out by the system. 

The static system only generally re-
quires a sensor on the rear axle of the 
 vehicle. A DC motor is used as each 
 headlamp’s actuator.

Dynamic system
The dynamic automatic system relies on 
two distinct operating modes to ensure 
 optimal headlamp orientation under all 
driving conditions. Supplementary capa-
bilities in speed-signal analysis over the 
static headlamp leveling control endow  
the system with the ability to differentiate 
between acceleration and braking.

With the vehicle driving at constant 
speed, the dynamic system, like the static 
system, remains in the range that features 
a high level of damping but as soon as the 
controller registers acceleration or brak-
ing, the system immediately switches to its 
dynamic mode. Faster signal processing 
and the higher servomotor adjustment 
speed allow the headlamp range to be re-
adjusted within fractions of a second. Fol-
lowing acceleration or braking, the system 
automatically reverts to operation in its 
delayed-response mode.

Due to the greater dynamics require-
ments, the dynamic system needs one sen-
sor per vehicle axle and rapid stepping 
motors to adjust the headlamps. 

Adaptive lighting systems
Adaptive frontlighting system (AFS)
From 2007, function enhancements for 
headlamp systems based on a new EC 
 control are permitted. The vehicle may 

then also have motorway lights, adverse 
weather lights and city lights. The opti-
mum light pattern for each of the functions 
is identified and automatically selected by 
the vehicle electronics in response to eval-
uation of various vehicle sensors. 

The first vehicles with AFS systems were 

registered back in mid-2006 thanks to an 
EU waiver for road traffic.

Adaptive rearlighting system (ARS)
Until now, the rear lights for vehicle pe-
rimeter lighting were equipped with single 
level switching. Depending on the type and 
design, these produced an invariable lumi-
nous intensity within the legal limit values. 
Today, a multitude of sensors are used to 
determine environmental parameters and 
light conditions (brightness, dirt, visual 
range, wet conditions, etc.). To achieve op-
timum visibility (sufficient luminous inten-
sity without excessive glare), the rear 
lights may in future vary luminous inten-
sity to suit the vehicle surrounding (Fig. 17).  
A stop lamp, for example, would be lit 
with high luminous intensity in sunlight 
and with low luminous intensities at night 
to ensure that other road users are able to 
recognize and draw the correct conclusion 
from the action of the vehicle.

Cornering lights (Europe)
The cornering lights function that has been 
approved for use in Germany since 2003 
improves visual range on corners and in 
turning situations. This is made possible by 
a variation of the horizontal illumination of 
the area in front of the vehicle. With static 
cornering lights, this is achieved by supple-
mentary reflectors being switched; with dy-
namic cornering lights, the headlamp mod-
ule is pivoted laterally (Fig. 18).

During the control process, the light mod-
ule or the reflector elements are pivoted 
by a stepping motor. The pivot angle and 
pivot speed are calculated by the corner-
ing lights ECU as a function of vehicle 
speed and the steering angle. Sensors de-
tect the adjustment angle of the headlamps 
and use failsafe algorithms to prevent daz-
zling of oncoming traffic in the event of a 
system malfunction.

Electronic stability 
program (ESP)

The electronic stability program (ESP) is  
a closed-loop system designed to improve 
driveability through programmed inter-
vention in the brake system and/or drive-
train. The integrated functionality of ABS1) 
prevents the wheels from locking when the 
brakes are applied, while TCS2) inhibits 
wheel spin during acceleration. The over-
all role of ESP is to prevent the vehicle’s 
tendency to “plow” or become unstable 
and break away to the side, provided the 
vehicle remains within its physical limits.

wheels in a targeted manner, such as the 
inner rear wheel to counter understeer,  
or the outer front wheel during oversteer, 
and helps to keep the vehicle’s course sta-
ble under all driving conditions. ESP can 
also accelerate the driven wheels by spe-
cific engine-control interventions to en-
sure the stability of the vehicle. 

1 ESP control loop in vehicle

Using this individual control concept, 
the system has two options for steering  
the vehicle: it can brake selected wheels 
(selective braking) or accelerate the  
driven wheels.

 ▶ achieving maximum possible conver-

gence between vehicle response in the 
limit range and its characteristics in  
the normal operating range (nominal 
 behavior).

The subordinate-level ABS and TCS con-
trollers trigger the actuators governing the 
brake hydraulics and the engine-manage-
ment system using the data generated in 
the ESP controller.

The following components register driver 
commands and the system evaluates their 
signals as the basis for defining nominal 
behavior:
 ▶ Engine-management system (e.g. apply 

accelerator pedal)

 ▶ Brake-pressure sensor (e.g. apply 

Antilock brake system (ABS)
The antilock brake system (ABS) detects 
incipient lock on one or more wheels and 
makes sure that the brake pressure re-
mains constant or is reduced. By so doing, 
it prevents the wheels from locking up and 
the vehicle remains steerable. 

brakes) or

 ▶ Steering-wheel-angle sensor (turning 

the steering wheel)

At this point the driver command is de-
fined as the specified response. The coeffi-
cient of friction and the vehicle speed are 
also included in the calculation. The “mon-
itor” estimates these factors based on sig-
nals transmitted by the sensors for
 ▶ Wheel speed
 ▶ Lateral acceleration
 ▶ Braking pressures and
 ▶ Yaw velocity 

The desired vehicle response is brought 
about by generating a yaw moment acting 
on the vehicle. In order to generate the de-
sired yaw moment, the system influences 
the tire-slip rate, and thus indirectly the 
longitudinal and side forces. The system in-
fluences the tire slip by varying the desired 
specifications for slip rate, which must then 
be executed by the subordinated ABS and 
TCS controllers.

The intervention process is designed to 
maintain the handling characteristics that 
the vehicle manufacturer intended the ve-
hicle to have and to serve as the basis for 
ensuring consistently reliable control.

The vehicle dynamics controller gener-
ates the specified yaw moment by relaying 
corresponding slip-modulation commands 
to the selected wheels.

Wheel-speed sensors
The speed of rotation of the wheels is an 
important input variable for the ABS con-
trol system. Wheel-speed sensors detect 
the speed of rotation of the wheels and 
pass the electrical signals to the control 
unit. 

A car may have three or four wheel-

speed sensors depending on which version 
of the ABS system is fitted (ABS system ver-
sions). The speed signals are used to calcu-
late the degree of slip between the wheels 
and the road surface and therefore detect 
incipient lock on individual wheels.

Electronic control unit
The ECU processes the information re-
ceived from the sensors according to de-
fined mathematical procedures (control al-
gorithms). The results of these calculations 
form the basis for the triggering signals 
sent to the hydraulic modulator. 

Hydraulic modulator
The hydraulic modulator incorporates a 
series of solenoid valves that can open or 
close the hydraulic circuits between the 
master cylinder (Fig. 2, Item 1) and the 
wheel-brake cylinders (4). In addition, it 
can connect the wheel-brake cylinders to 
the return pump (6). Solenoid valves with 
two hydraulic connections and two valve 
positions are used (2/2 solenoid valves). 

48  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Electronic stability program (ESP)

The intake valve (7) between the master 
cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinder 
controls pressure build-up, while the ex-
haust valve (8) between the wheel-brake 
cylinder and the return pump controls 
pressure release. There is one such pair  
of solenoid valves for each wheel-brake 
cylinder.

Under normal conditions, the solenoid 

valves in the hydraulic modulator are at 
the “pressure build-up” setting. That 
means the intake valve is open. The hy-
draulic modulator then forms a straight-
through connection between the master 
cylinder and the wheel-brake cylinders. 
Consequently, the brake pressure gener-
ated in the master cylinder when the 
brakes are applied is transmitted directly 
to the wheel-brake cylinders at each 
wheel. 

As the degree of brake slip increases 
due to braking on a slippery surface or 
panic braking, the risk of the wheels lock-
ing up also increases. The solenoid valves 
are then switched to the “maintain pres-

sure” setting. The connection between the 
master cylinder and the wheel-brake cyl-
inder is shut off (intake valve is closed) so 
that any increase of pressure in the master 
cylinder does not lead to an increase in 
brake pressure.

If the degree of slip of any of the wheels 

increases further despite this action, the 
pressure in the wheel-brake cylinder(s) 
concerned must be reduced. To achieve 
this, the solenoid valves are switched to 
the “pressure release” setting. The intake 
valve is still closed, and in addition, the 
 exhaust valve opens to allow the return 
pump integrated in the hydraulic modula-
tor to draw brake fluid from the brake(s) 
concerned in a controlled manner. The 
brake pressure in the wheel-brake cylin-
der is thus reduced so that wheel lock-up 
does not occur.

Controlled system
 ▶ The vehicle and its wheel brakes 
 ▶ The wheels and the friction pairing  

of tire and road surface

The disturbance values affecting the  
control loop
 ▶ Changes in the frictional connection 

 between the tires and the road surface 
caused by different types of road surface 
and changes in wheel load, e.g. when 
cornering

 ▶ Irregularities in the road surface causing 

the wheels and axles to vibrate

 ▶ Lack of circularity of the tires, low tire 
pressure, worn tire tread, differences  
in circumference between wheels,  
(e.g. spare wheel)

 ▶ Brake hysteresis and fade
 ▶ Differences in master-cylinder pressure 

between the two brake circuits 

Controller
 ▶ The wheel-speed sensors
 ▶ The ABS control unit

Controlled variables
 ▶ Wheel speed and, derived from it,  

wheel deceleration

 ▶ Wheel acceleration and brake slip

The reference variable
 ▶ The foot pressure applied to the brake 
pedal by the driver – amplified by the 
brake booster – generates the brake 
pressure in the brake system

The correcting variable
 ▶ Brake pressure in the wheel-brake 

 cylinder

Controlled system
The data-processing operations performed 
by the ABS control unit are based on the 
following simplified controlled system: 
 ▶ A non-driven wheel 
 ▶ A quarter of the vehicle’s mass appor-

tioned to that wheel 

 ▶ Wheel brake 

 ▶ An idealized coefficient of friction slip 

curve (substitute for the friction pairing 
of tire and road) 

That curve is divided into a stable zone 
with a linear gradient and an unstable 
zone with a constant progression (µHFmax). 
As an additional simplification, there is 
also an assumed initial straight-line brak-
ing response that is equivalent to a panic-
braking reaction.

Figure 4 shows the relationships between 
brake torque MB (the torque that can be 
generated by the brake through the tire), 
or road frictional torque MR (torque that 
acts against the wheel through the friction 
pairing of tire and road surface), and time t, 
as well as the relationships between the 
wheel deceleration (–a) and time t, 
whereby the brake torque increases in lin-
ear fashion over time. The road frictional 
torque lags slightly behind the brake 
torque by the time delay T, as long as the 
braking sequence is within the stable zone

of the curve for coefficient of friction ver-
sus brake slip. After about 130 ms, the 
maximum level (µHFmax) – and therefore the 
unstable zone – of the curve for coefficient 
of friction versus brake slip is reached. 
From that point on, the curve for coeffi-
cient of friction versus brake slip states 
that while the brake torque MB, continues 
to rise at an undiminished rate, the road 
frictional torque MR, cannot increase any 
further and remains constant. In the pe-
riod between 130 and 240 ms (this is when 
the wheel locks up), the minimal torque 
difference MB – MR, that was present in 
the stable zone rises rapidly to a high fig-
ure. That torque difference is a precise 
measure of the wheel deceleration (–a) of 
the braked wheel (Fig. 4, bottom). In the 
stable zone, the wheel deceleration is lim-
ited to a small rate, whereas in the unsta-
ble zone it increases rapidly, according to 
the amount. As a consequence, the curve 
for coefficient of friction versus wheel slip 
reveals opposite characteristics in the sta-
ble and unstable zones. The ABS exploits 
these opposing characteristics. 

Controlled variables
An essential factor in determining the ef-
fectiveness of an ABS control system is the 
choice of controlled variables. The basis 
for that choice is the wheel-speed sensor 
signals from which the ECU calculates the 
deceleration/acceleration of the wheel, 
brake slip, the reference speed and the ve-
hicle deceleration. On their own, neither 
the wheel deceleration/acceleration nor 
the brake slip are suitable as controlled 
variables because, under braking, a driven 
wheel behaves entirely differently to a 
non-driven wheel. However, by combining 
those variables on the basis of appropriate 
logical relationships, good results can be 
obtained.

speed under ideal braking conditions (op-
timum degree of brake slip). So that speed 
can be determined, the wheel-speed sen-
sors continuously transmit signals to the 
ECU for calculating the speed of the wheels. 
The ECU takes the signals from a pair of 
diagonally opposed wheels (e.g. right front 
and left rear) and calculates the reference 
speed from them. Under partial braking, 
the faster of the two diagonally opposite 
wheels generally determines the reference 
speed. If the ABS cuts in under emergency 
braking, the wheel speeds will be different 
from the vehicle speed and can thus not be 
used for calculating the reference speed 
without adjustment. During the ABS con-
trol sequence, the ECU provides the refer-
ence speed based on the speed at the start 
of the control sequence and reduces it at a 
linear rate. The gradient of the reference-
speed graph is determined by analyzing 
logical signals and relationships.

If, in addition to the wheel acceleration/
deceleration and the brake slip, the vehicle 
deceleration is brought into the equation as 
an additional quantity, and if the logical cir-
cuit in the ECU is modulated by computa-
tion results, then ideal brake control can be 
achieved. This concept has been realized in 
the Bosch antilock brake system (ABS).

Traction-control system (TCS)
The antilock brake system (ABS) prevents 
the wheel lock when the brakes are ap-
plied by lowering the wheel brake pres-
sures. The traction-control system (TCS) 
prevents wheel spin by reducing the drive 
torque at each driven wheel. 

In addition to this safety-relevant task  
of ensuring the stability and steerability  
of the vehicle when accelerating, TCS also 
improves the traction of the vehicle by 
regulating the optimum slip. The upper 
limit here is, of course, set by the traction 
requirement stipulated by the driver.

As brake slip is not directly measurable, 
the ECU calculates a quantity that approxi-
mates to it. The basis for the calculation is 
the reference speed, which represents the 

The TCS regulates the slip of the driven 
wheels as quickly as possible to the opti-
mum level. To do this the system first de-

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Electronic stability program (ESP)  |  51

termines a setpoint value for the slip. This 
value depends on a number of factors that 
represent the current driving situation. 
These factors include:
 ▶ The basic characteristic for TCS refer-

ence slip (based on the slip requirement 
of a tire during acceleration)
 ▶ Effective coefficient of friction
 ▶ External tractive resistance (deep snow, 

Both these parameters are therefore cor-
recting variables of the TCS which can be 
used to regulate the slip at each wheel to 
the reference slip level. 

In gasoline-engine vehicles, the drive 
torque MKar can be controlled using the 
following engine-control interventions:
 ▶ Throttle valve (throttle valve 

rough road, etc.)

 adjustment)

 ▶ Yaw velocity, lateral acceleration, and 

 ▶ Ignition system (ignition-timing 

steering angle of the vehicle

 advance)

 ▶ Fuel-injection system (phasing  
out individual injection pulses)

In diesel-engine vehicles, the drive torque 
MKar is influenced by the electronic diesel 
control system (EDC) (reduction in the in-
jected fuel quantity).

The brake torque MBr can be regulated for 
each wheel via the brake system. The TCS 
function requires the original ABS hydrau-
lic system to be expanded because of the 
need for active pressure build-up. 

TCS interventions
The measured wheel speeds and the respec-
tive drive slip can be influenced by changing 
the torque balance Mtot at each drive wheel. 
The torque balance Mtot at each driven wheel 
results from the drive torque MKar/2 
at this wheel, the respective brake torque 
MBr and the road torque MStr (Fig. 5).

Mtot = MKar /2 + MBr + MStr
(MBr and MStr are negative here.)

This balance can obviously by influenced 
by the drive torque MKar provided by the 
engine as well as by the brake torque MBr.

Adaptive cruise control 
(ACC)

System description
Like the basic cruise-control system that 
has been available as a standard feature 
for many years, ACC (Adaptive Cruise Con-
trol) can be categorized as a driver-assis-
tance system. Cruise control regulates 
driving speed to maintain the desired 
speed selected by the driver using the 
cruise-control unit. In addition to the basic 
cruise-control function, ACC measures the 
distance to the vehicle in front and its rela-
tive speed, and uses this information to-
gether with other collected data (position 
of other vehicles in the same or different 
lane; in future, even stationary objects) to 
regulate the time gap between the vehi-
cles. ACC is thus able to adapt the vehicle’s 
speed to match the speed of the vehicle 
traveling in front and maintain a safe dis-
tance from it. The driver is able to override 
or switch off the ACC function at any time 
(e.g. by depressing the gas or brake pedal).

Distance sensor
In the main, ACC systems currently have a 
radar sensor (Fig. 1, Item 1) that operates  
in a frequency range of between 76 and 
77 GHz and emits four radar lobes. Once 

 activated, ACC detects a range of up to ap-
proximately 200 m in front of the vehicle. 
The radar beams reflected by vehicles in 
front are analyzed for timing, Doppler shift 
and amplitude ratio. These factors are used 
to calculate distance, relative speed and an-
gle position relative to vehicles in front.

Network architecture
The ACC function cannot be represented 
independently as a stand-alone system; 
various subsystems (engine-management 
system, electronic stability program, trans-
mission control, instrument cluster) must 
be networked with each other. The evalua-
tion and control electronics (control unit) 
of the ACC are integrated in the sensor 
housing. They receive and send data on a 
CAN data bus from and to other electronic 
control units.

Course setting 
To ensure reliable ACC operation no mat-
ter what the situation – e.g. also on bends – 
it is essential that the preceding vehicles 
can be allocated to the correct lane(s).  
For this purpose, the information from the 
ESP sensor system (yaw rate, steering an-
gle, wheel speeds and lateral acceleration) 
is evaluated with regard to the ACC-
equipped vehicle’s own curve status.

Setting options
The driver inputs the desired speed and 
the desired time gap; the time gap avail-
able to the driver usually ranges from 1 to 
2 s. The time gap to the vehicle in front is 
calculated from the radar signals and com-
pared with the desired time gap specified 
by the driver. If this value is shorter than 
the desired value, the ACC system responds 
in a manner appropriate to the traffic situ-
ation by initially reducing engine torque, 
and only if necessary by automatically 
braking the vehicle. If the desired time gap 
is exceeded, the vehicle accelerates until 
either the speed of the vehicle in front or 
the desired speed set by the driver is 
reached. 

Engine-control intervention
Speed control requires an electronic en-
gine-performance control system. The ME 
or DI Motronic engine-management sys-
tem and the electronic diesel control (EDC) 
are integrated with this function. This sys-
tem allows the vehicle to be accelerated to 
the desired speed or, if an obstacle appears, 
to be decelerated by means of automatic 
throttle closing.

Brake intervention
If the rate of deceleration achieved by eas-
ing off the gas is not sufficient, the vehicle 
will have to be braked. The electronic sta-
bility program (ESP) is required here as it 
is able to initiate the brake intervention. 
Due to the design of ACC as a comfort 
system, the braking deceleration calcu-
lated by the ACC controller is limited to 
approximately 2 to 3 m/s2 with current 
ACC systems. If this is not sufficient for the 
current traffic situation (e.g. if the vehicle 
in front brakes sharply), the vehicle audi-
bly requests the driver to take over re-
sponsibility for braking. The necessary 
braking deceleration is then to be achieved 
using the service brake. Safety functions, 
such as panic braking, are not part of the 
ACC system.

The other stabilizing systems of ABS, 
TCS or ESP may be active as normal during 
an active ACC control intervention as nec-
essary. Depending on the parameter set-
tings of ACC, stabilization interventions 
may result in ACC being deactivated.

Object detection and lane allocation
The central task of the radar sensor and its 
integrated electronics is to detect objects 
and allocate them either to the same lane 
as the one on which the vehicle is travel-
ing, or to a different lane. Firstly, lane allo-
cation demands the precise detection of 
vehicles in front (high angle resolution and 
accuracy), and secondly, a precise know-
ledge of the motion of the system’s own 
 vehicle. Vehicle motion is calculated from 
the signals sent by sensors also used for 
the electronic stability program (ESP) 
(course prediction). These include the 
wheel-speed sensors and driving-dynam-
ics sensors for the yaw rate and lateral 
 acceleration. Optionally, information sup-
plied by a steering-angle sensor may also 
be processed. The decision as to which of 
the detected objects is used as the refer-
ence for adaptive cruise control is essen-
tially based on a comparison between the 
positions and motion of the detected ob-
jects and the motion of the system’s own 
vehicle. 

Adjustment 
The radar sensor is fitted at the front end 
of the vehicle. Its radar lobes are aligned 
relative to the vehicle longitudinal axis. 
This is done using adjusting screws at the 
fastening part of the sensor. If it is moved 
out of alignment by physical force, e.g. 
 deformation of the mounting due to acci-
dent damage or any other effect, realign-
ment must be carried out. Small degrees  
of misalignment are automatically cor-
rected by the permanently active align-
ment routines implemented in the soft-
ware. If manual realignment is required, 
this is indicated to the driver.    

Control and display
Controls include switches, push-buttons or 
thumbwheels for 
 ▶ Activating the function and 
 ▶ Setting the desired speed and 
 ▶ Desired time gap 

The following information may be displayed 
to the driver in the instrument cluster:
 ▶ Desired speed
 ▶ Information on the activation status
 ▶ The time gap selected by the driver
 ▶ Indication of the follow-up mode, which 
informs the driver as to whether the sys-
tem is controlling the distance to a de-
tected target object or not

System limits
ACC does not yet permit control opera-
tions in city environments. This system  
can only be activated at speeds in excess  
of 30 km/h. 

Control algorithms
The control system basically consists of 
three control modules:
 ▶ Control module 1: cruise control 

If the radar sensor has not detected any 
vehicles in front, the system maintains 
the desired speed set by the driver.
 ▶ Control module 2: follow-up control

The radar sensor has detected vehicles 
in front. Control essentially maintains 
the time gap to the nearest vehicle at a 
constant setting. 

 ▶ Control module 3: control when cornering
When negotiating tight bends, the radar 
sensor can “lose sight” of the vehicle in 
front because of the limited width of its 
“field of vision”. Until the vehicle comes 
in sight of the radar again, or until the 
system is switched to normal cruise 
 control, special measures come into 
 effect. Depending on the manufacturer, 
the speed would then be maintained,  
the current rate of lateral acceleration 
adapted or the ACC function deactivated, 
for example.

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Adaptive cruise control (ACC)  |  57

in front is delayed in accordance with the 
signal propagation time (fe, dashed line in 
Fig. 3). In the rising ramp, the frequency is 
lower; in the falling ramp, the frequency is 
higher by the same amount. The difference 
in frequency Df is a direct measure for the 
distance.

If there is additionally a relative speed 

between the vehicles, the receive fre-
quency fe is increased (fe', dotted line in 
Fig. 3) by a specific amount Dfd in both the 
rising and falling ramp due to the Doppler 
effect. This produces two different fre-
quency differences Df1 and Df2. Their addi-
tion produces the distance between the ve-
hicles, and their subtraction the relative 
speed of the vehicles.

The signal processing in the frequency 
range therefore delivers a frequency for 
each object that as a linear combination 
produces a term for distance and relative 
speed. From the measured frequencies of 
two ramps with a different gradient, it is 
possible to determine the distance to and 
the relative speed of an object. For situa-
tions involving several targets, several 
ramps with a different gradient are re-
quired.

Ranging radar
The radar (RAdiation Detecting And Rang-
ing) transceiver unit transmits packets of 
 electromagnetic waves using an antenna. 
These reflect off an object made of electri-
cally conductive materials (e.g. vehicle 
body) and are then received. The signals 
received in this manner are “compared” 
with the transmitted signals with respect 
to their propagation time and/or fre-
quency. 

Measuring principles
Propagation time measurement
For all radar methods, the distance mea-
surement is based on the direct or indirect 
propagation time measurement for the 
time between when the radar signal is 
transmitted and when the signal echo is 
received. The direct propagation time 
measurement is used to measure period t. 
With direct reflection, this is equal to twice 
the distance d to the reflector divided by 
the speed of light c:

t = 2d/c

τ ≈ 1 µs.

For a distance of d = 150 m and 
c ≈ 300,000 km/s, the propagation time is

Frequency modulation
Direct propagation time measurement re-
quires much effort; an indirect propaga-
tion time measurement is simpler. The 
method is known as FMCW (Frequency 
Modulated Continuous Wave). Rather than 
comparing the times between the trans-
mitted signal and received echo, the 
FMCW radar compares the frequencies of 
the transmitted signal and received echo. 
The prerequisite for a meaningful mea-
surement is a modulated transmit fre-
quency. 

With the FMCW method, radar waves 
linearly modulated in their frequency are 
transmitted for a duration of typically a 
few milliseconds and in a cycle of a few 
hundred MHz (fs, continuous curve in 
Fig. 3). The signal reflected off a vehicle

Doppler effect
Although the relative speed of the other 
vehicle can be measured using a number 
of subsequent distance measurements,  
it is calculated more quickly, more reliably 
and more accurately when the Doppler ef-
fect is utilized in the measurement.

For an object moving relative to the radar 
sensor with a relative speed (relative speed 
vrel), the signal echo undergoes a frequency 
shift fD compared to the emitted signal. 
At the relevant differential speeds, this is 
represented as:

fD = 22fC ? vrel/c 

fC is the carrier frequency of the signal. 
At the radar frequencies commonly used 
for ACC, fC = 76.5 GHz, there is a frequency 
shift of fD ≈ 2510 ? vrel/m, and thus 510 Hz 
at a relative speed of 21 m/s (approaching).

Angle measurement
The third basic dimension which is needed 
is the side offset (angle) of the preceding 
vehicle. The only way this can be mea-
sured is by radiating the radar beam in a 
number of different directions. The (re-
flected) signals are then applied to deter-
mine from which direction the strongest 
reflection came. This method needs either 
high-speed back-and-forth movement of 

the beam (scanning), or the installation of 
a multi-beam antenna array.
 
High-frequency part of the ACC sensor
The high-frequency part can be broken 
down into four functional groups.

HF generation
The HF generation and control section 
makes the high frequency available for 
transmission (Fig. 4). The HF output of 
 between 76 and 77 GHz is generated using 
a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) com-
prising a Gunn diode in a mechanical reso-
nator. A small part of the output generated 
is downmixed into an intermediate fre-
quency band using a dielectrical reso-
nance oscillator (DRO) with harmonic 
mixer and supplied to the control elec-
tronics (PLL-ASIC, PLL = Phase Locked 
Loop). The latter controls the VCO by 
means of an output driver and provides 
frequency stabilization and modulation. 

Transmission and reception circuit
In the transmission and reception circuit, 
the HF output is divided between four 
transmission/reception channels by three 
Wilkinson splitters. Using bandpass mix-
ers, this output is supplied to the antenna 
while the return signal is downmixed to 
the basic band.

Amplification
Signals in the basic band are amplified in 
an ASIC. It has four channels, switching 
amplification, and a special characteristic 
curve. To some extent, this compensates 
for the large signal dynamics in that high 
frequencies (correspondingly high dis-
tances) are more strongly amplified. In ad-
dition, the characteristic is integrated with 
a low-pass anti-aliasing filter for subse-
quent scanning.

Antenna system
The antenna system is a monostatic sys-
tem. It comprises four combined transmit-
ter and receiver patches on the HF sub-
strate, four polyrods (plastic cones) for 
prefocusing and a plastic lens for beam 
concentration. As part of the housing, the 
lens also acts as a radar-optical window 
and shield. The radar waves are emitted 
 simultaneously and coherently by the  
four antenna patches to produce a single 
transmission wave. The beams are only 
 actually split into four separate beams on 
the receiver side. Four separate receiver 
channels are used here.

The transmit frequency is modulated  
by the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 
in a linearly ramped fashion (Fig. 3) with a 
gradient of m = df/dt. While the received 
signal returns after the propagation  
time t = 2d/c the transmit frequency has 
changed in the meantime by the differen-
tial frequency fD = t ? m. Therefore, the 
propagation time, and thus the distance, 
can be measured  indirectly by ascertaining 
the differential frequency between the 
transmitted and received signals. The 
 differential frequency, in turn, can be as-
certained using a mixer, followed by low-
pass filtering. To determine the frequency, 
the signal is digitized and converted into  
a frequency spectrum using an FFT (Fast 
Fourier Transformation). 

However, the information about the dif-
ference frequency does not only contain 
information for the propagation time but 
also for the Doppler shift. This situation 
means that there is at first a certain ambi-
guity in the evaluation. It can be resolved 
by applying multiple FMCW modulation 
cycles with different gradients.

To determine the angle at which the radar 
locates an object, multiple radar lobes are 
transmitted and evaluated. At least two 
overlapping radar beams are required to 
measure the angle. No conclusions on the 
angle of sight can be drawn from the rela-
tionships between the amplitudes that are 
measured for an object in adjacent beams. 
If, for example, four radar beams are used, 
the horizontal angular dependence of 
which is shown in Figure 5 in the form of a 
two-way antenna diagram as an example,  
it is possible to determine the horizontal 
angle of sight by comparing amplitude and 
phase of the measured radar signals using 
the antenna diagram.

CAN, lens heating to prevent icing).  
In addition, a watchdog is also integrated. 
Using a temperature sensor, it is possible 
to measure the internal temperature of  
the system.

The unit is connected to the vehicle by 

an eight-pin connector. The connector 
supplies battery voltage (approximately  
12 V), ground (GND), two CAN buses,  
or  alternatively a wakeup or K line,  
or a radome heater, or a time gap signal.
The low-frequency circuit can be de-

signed using standard printed-circuit 
board technology. Figure 7 provides a  
look inside the unit.

Radar signal processing
The low-frequency part of the FMCW ra-
dar comprises several components (Fig. 6).
A dual-core processor is used for digital 
data processing. The digital signal proces-
sor (DSP) contained in this module is used 
for data acquisition, calculating the fast 
fourier transform (FFT) and for other basic 
signal processing. The processor also con-
tains a microcontroller in which additional 
signal processing, the application software 
and control unit functions are executed. 
Furthermore, various peripherals are inte-
grated in the dual processor: serial inter-
faces, two CAN controllers (Controller 
Area Network), an analog/digital converter 
and various digital ports.

The processor is surrounded by various 
peripheral modules. The analog radar sig-
nals from the HF PCB are converted into 
digital sample values in an analog/digital 
converter (ADC). This takes place simulta-
neously for four channels. A digital low-
pass filter is also integrated in this module 
to ensure limitation to the Nyquist band-
width. An EEPROM is used as an external, 
non-volatile memory. Application para-
meters and, if applicable, fault codes are 
stored here. A multifunction ASIC is used 
to generate the supply voltages (different 
DC voltages) and as an output driver (K line,

Occupant-protection systems

In the event of an accident, occupant-pro-
tection systems are intended to keep the 
accelerations and forces that act on the 
passengers low and lessen the conse-
quences of the accident. These passive 
 vehicle safety systems include:
 ▶ Seat belts with seat-belt pretensioners
 ▶ Airbags and
 ▶ Rollover protection systems  

(on  cabriolets)

Seat belts and seat-belt pretensioners pro-
vide the greater part of the protective ef-
fect since they absorb 50 to 60 % of impact 
energy. With front airbags, the energy ab-
sorption is about 70 % if deployment tim-
ing is properly synchronized.

In order to achieve optimum protection, 
the response of all components of the com-
plete occupant-protection system must be 
adapted to one another.

Seat belts and seat-belt pretensioners
Function
The function of seat belts is to restrain  
the occupants of a vehicle in their seats 
when the vehicle impacts against an obsta-
cle. In the event of a frontal impact, seat-
belt pretensioners pull the seat belts 
tighter against the body and hold the up-
per body as closely as possible against the 
seat backrest. This prevents unimpeded 
forward displacement of the occupants 
caused by inertia. Seat-belt pretensioners 
thus improve the restraining characteris-
tics of a three-point inertia-reel belt and 
increase protection against injury.

Operating principle
In an impact, the shoulder-belt tightener 
eliminates the seat belt slack and the “film-
reel effect” by rolling up and tightening 
the belt webbing. On activation, the system 
electrically fires a pyrotechnic propellant 
charge. The rising pressure acts on a piston,

which turns the belt reel via a steel  cable 
in such a way that the belt is held tightly 
against the body (Fig. 2).

Variants
In addition to the shoulder-belt tighteners, 
there are variants which pull the seat-belt 
buckle back (buckle tighteners) and simul-
taneously tighten the shoulder and lap 
belts. Buckle tighteners further improve 
the restraining effect and the protection to 
prevent occupants from sliding forward 
under the lap belt (“submarining effect”). 
A further improvement is achieved by 
the use of belt-force limiters. In this case, 
the seat belt tighteners initially tighten 
fully (using the maximum force of approx. 
4 kN, for example) and restrain the occu-
pants. If a certain belt tension is exceeded, 
the belt gives thereby extending the de-
gree of forward movement. The kinetic en-
ergy is converted into deformation energy, 
which prevents the occurrence of acceler-

ation peaks. Deformation elements include 
a torsion rod in the inertia reel shaft. 
 However, there is also an electronically 
controlled single-stage belt-force limiter, 
which reduces the belt tension to 1 to 2 kN 
by firing a detonator a specific period after 
deployment of the second front airbag 
stage and after a specific extent of forward 
movement is reached.

Front airbag
Function
The function of front airbags is to protect 
the driver and front passenger against 
head and chest injuries in a vehicle impact 
with an obstacle. In a serious accident,  
a seat-belt pretensioner cannot keep the 
head from striking the steering wheel. 

Operating principle
To protect driver and front passenger, py-
rotechnical gas inflators inflate the driver 
and passenger airbags highly dynamically 
after a vehicle impact detected by sensors. 
In order to provide maximum protection, 
the airbag must be fully inflated before  
the occupant plunges into it. Once the 
 occupant makes contact with it, the airbag 
partly deflates in order to “gently” absorb 
impact energy acting on the occupant with 
noncritical (in terms of injury) surface 
pressures and declaration forces. 

The maximum permissible forward dis-
placement of the driver before the airbag 
on the driver’s side has inflated is approxi-
mately 12.5 cm. This equates to a time of 
approximately 40 ms from the start of im-
pact (in the case of an impact with a hard 
obstacle at 50 km/h). 10 ms elapse before 
the electronics detect the impact and trig-
ger the electronic ignition system. A fur-
ther 30 ms is required for the airbag to 
 inflate. The airbag is deflated through the 
outlet openings after another 80 to 100 ms. 
The entire process takes little more than a 
tenth of a second.

Impact detection
The deceleration arising from the impact  
is detected by one (or two) longitudinal 
 acceleration sensor(s) and the change in 
speed is calculated from it. In order to be 
able to better detect oblique and offset im-
pacts, the deployment algorithm can also 
evaluate the signal from the lateral accel-
eration sensor.

The impact must also be analyzed in 
 addition to the crash sensing. The airbag 
should not trigger from a hammer blow in 
the workshop, gentle impacts, bottoming 
out, driving over curbstones or potholes. 
With this goal in mind, the sensor signals 
are processed in digital analysis algo-
rithms whose sensitivity parameters have 
been optimized with the aid of crash data 
simulations. Depending on the vehicle 
manufacturer’s production concept, the 
deployment parameters and the vehicle’s 
equipment level can also be programmed 
into the ECU at the end of the assembly 
line (“end-of-line programming”).

In order to prevent airbag-related injuries 
to “out-of-position” occupants (e.g. lean-
ing too far forward) or to small children  
in reboard (rearward-facing) child seats,  
it is essential that the front airbags be trig-
gered and inflated in accordance with the 
particular situations. The following mea-
sures are implemented for this purpose:

Deactivation switch
This can be used to disable the passenger 
airbag. The status of the airbag function is 
indicated by lamps.

Intelligent airbag systems
The introduction of improved sensing 
functions and control options for the air-
bag inflation process, with the accompany-
ing improvement in protective effect, is in-
tended to result in a gradual reduction in 
the risk of injury. Such functional improve-
ments are:

 ▶ Impact severity detection through fur-
ther optimization of the deployment al-
gorithm or the use of one or two upfront 
sensors (Fig. 4). The latter are accelera-
tion sensors installed in the vehicle’s 
crumple zone (e.g. on the radiator cross-
member) which facilitate early detection 
of and distinction between different 
types of impact, such as ODB (Offset 
 Deformable Barrier) crashes, pole or 
 underride impacts. They also allow an 
 assessment of the impact energy.

 ▶ Seltbelt usage detection.
 ▶ Occupant presence, position and weight 

detection.

detection.

 ▶ Seat position and backrest inclination 

 ▶ Use of front airbags with two-stage gas 
inflators or with single-stage gas infla-
tors and pyrotechnically triggered gas-
discharge valves.

 ▶ Use of seat-belt pretensioners with oc-
cupant-weight-dependent belt-force 
limiters.

 ▶ Through data exchange with other 

 systems, e.g. ESP (Electronic Stability 
Program), and environment sensors,  
it is possible to use information from  
the phase shortly before the impact to 
further optimize the deployment of  
the  restraints. 

Side airbag
Function
Side airbags, which inflate along the length 
of the roof lining for head protection (in-
flatable tubular systems, window bags, 
 inflatable curtains) or from the door or 
seat backrest (thorax bags, upper body 
protection) are designed to cushion the 
 occupants and protect them from injury  
in the event of a side impact.

Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Occupant-protection systems  |  65

Operating principle
Due to the lack of a crumple zone, and the 
minimum distance between the occupants 
and the vehicle’s side structural compo-
nents, it is particularly difficult for side 
airbags to inflate in time. For this reason, 
the time required for crash sensing and 
 activating of the side airbags is approxi-
mately 5 to 10 ms for hard side impacts. 
The inflation time of the approximately 
12 l capacity thorax bag is not permitted  
to be more than 10 ms.

These requirements can be fulfilled 
through evaluation of peripheral (at suit-
able points on the body, e.g. b-pillar or 
door), lateral (sideways) acceleration and 
pressure sensors.

Rollover protection systems
Function
In the event of an accident where the vehi-
cle rolls over, open-top vehicles such as 
convertibles lack the protecting and sup-
porting roof structure of closed-top vehi-
cles. Extendable rollover bars or the ex-
tendable head restraints provide protec-
tion against injury for occupants.

Operating principle
Current sensing concepts no longer trigger 
the system at a fixed threshold but rather 
at a threshold that conforms to a situation 
and only for the most common rollover 
 situation, i.e. about the longitudinal axis.  
The Bosch sensing concept involves a sur-
face micromechanical yaw-rate sensor and 
high-resolution acceleration sensors in  
the vehicle’s transverse and vertical axes 
(y and z axes).

The yaw-rate sensor is the main sensor, 
while the y and z-axis acceleration sensors 
are used both to check plausibility and to 
detect the type of rollover (slope, gradient, 
curb impact or “soil-trip” rollover). On 
Bosch systems, these sensors are incorpo-
rated in the airbag triggering unit.

Deployment of occupant-protection sys-
tems is adapted to the situation according 
to the type of rollover, the yaw rate and the 
lateral acceleration, i.e. systems are trig-
gered after between 30 and 3,000 ms by 
automatic selection and use of the algo-
rithm module appropriate to the type of 
rollover.

Combined ECUs for seat-belt preten-
sioners, front and side airbags and 
 rollover protection equipment
Optimum occupant protection against the 
effects of frontal, offset, oblique or pole 
impact is obtained through the precisely 
coordinated interaction of electronically 
detonated pyrotechnical front airbags and 
seat-belt pretensioners. To maximize the 
effect of both protective devices, they are 
activated with optimized time response by 
a common ECU installed in the passenger 
cell. 

The following functions are currently 
 incorporated in the central ECU, also re-
ferred to as the trigger unit:
 ▶ Crash sensing by acceleration sensor 

and safety switch or by two acceleration 
sensors without safety switch (redun-
dant, fully electronic sensing).

 ▶ Rollover detection by yaw rate and 

 acceleration sensors that record y and  
z axis acceleration in the low-g range 
(up to approximately 5 g).

 ▶ Prompt activation of front airbags and 
seat-belt pretensioners in response to 
different types of impact in the vehicle 
longitudinal direction (e.g. frontal, 
oblique, offset, pole, rear-end).

 ▶ Control of rollover protection equip-

ment.

 ▶ For the side airbags, the ECU operates in 
conjunction with a central lateral sensor 
and two or four peripheral acceleration 
sensors. The peripheral acceleration 
sensors (PAS) transmit the triggering 
command to the central ECU via a digital 
interface. The central ECU triggers the

side airbags provided the internal lat-
eral sensor has confirmed a side impact 
by means of a plausibility check. Since 
the central plausibility confirmation ar-
rives too late in the case of impacts into 
the door or above the sill, peripheral 
pressure sensors (PPS) inside the door 
cavity are used to measure the adiabatic 
pressure changes caused by deforma-
tion of the door. This will result in rapid 
detection of door impacts. Confirma-
tion of “plausibility” is now provided by 
PAS mounted on supporting peripheral 
structural components. This is now 
 unquestionably faster than the central 
lateral-acceleration sensors.

 ▶ Voltage transformer and energy accu-
mulator in case the supply of power 
from the vehicle battery is interrupted. 
 ▶ Selective triggering of the seat-belt pre-
tensioners, depending on monitored 
seat-belt buckle status: firing of the 
 airbag only takes place if the belt is en-
gaged in the belt buckle. At present, 
proximity-type seat-belt buckle 
switches are used, i.e. Hall IC switches 
which detect the change in the magnetic 
field when the buckle is fastened.

 ▶ Setting of multiple trigger thresholds for 
two-stage seat-belt pretensioners and 
two-stage front airbags depending on 
the status of belt use and seat occupa-
tion.

 ▶ Reading of signals from the interior sen-
sors and appropriate triggering of re-
straints.

 ▶ Watchdog (WD): airbag triggering units 
must meet high safety standards with 
 regard to false activation in non-crash 
situations and correct activation when 
needed (crashes). For this reason, ninth-
generation (AB 9) airbags launched in 
2003 incorporate three independent 
hardware watchdogs (WDs): WD1 moni-
tors the 2 MHz system eClock using a 
dedicated, independent oscillator. 
WD2 monitors the realtime processes 

(time base 500 μs) for correct and com-
plete sequence. For this reason, the 
safety controller (SCON, see Fig. 4)  
sends the microcomputer eight digital 
messages to which it must respond by 
sending eight correct replies to the 
SCON within a time window of 1 ± 0.3 ms. 
WD3 monitors the background pro-
cesses such as the built-in self-test rou-
tines of the ARM core for correct opera-
tion. The microcomputer’s response to 
the SCON in this case must be provided 
within a period of 100 ms.

 ▶ With AB 9, sensors, analyzer modules 

and driver stages are linked by two SPIs 
(Serial Peripheral Interfaces). The sen-
sors have digital outputs and their sig-
nals can be transmitted directly via SPIs. 
Shunts therefore remain on the printed-
circuit board without effect, unlike with 
analog sinusoidal transfers, and a high 
level of functional reliability is achieved. 
Deployment is only permitted if an inde-
pendent hardware plausibility channel 
has also detected the impact and enables 
the driver stages for a limited period.

tions and of system components.

Acceleration sensors
Acceleration sensors for crash sensing  
can be located at the following points in 
the vehicle:
 ▶ Directly integrated in the ECU (seat-belt 

pretensioners, front airbag)

 ▶ At selected points on the right and left-
hand side of the vehicle on supporting 
structural parts such as seat crossmem-
bers, door sills, b and c-pillar (side air-
bag) or

 ▶ In the deformation zone at the front  

end of the vehicle (upfront sensors for 
“intelligent airbag systems”)

68  |  Electrical and electronic systems in the vehicle  |  Occupant-protection systems

These sensors are surface micromechani-
cal sensors consisting of fixed and moving 
finger structures and spring pins. Since the 
sensors only have low working capaci-
tances (approximately 1 pF), it is neces-
sary to accommodate the evaluation elec-
tronics in the same housing in the immedi-
ate proximity of the sensor element so as 
to avoid stray capacitance and other forms 
of interference.

Gas inflators
The pyrotechnical propellant charges of 
the gas inflators for generating the airbag 
inflation gas and for actuating seat-belt 
pretensioners are activated by an electri-
cal firing element. The gas inflator in ques-
tion inflates the airbag with charge gas. 
The driver airbag built in the steering-
wheel hub (volume approx. 60 l) or, as the 
case may be, the passenger airbag fitted in 
the glove compartment space (approx. 120 l) 
is inflated in approx. 30 ms from firing.

AC firing
In order to prevent inadvertent triggering 
through contact between the firing ele-
ment and the vehicle system voltage (e.g. 
faulty insulation in the wiring harness),  

the firing element is fired by alternating-
current pulses with a frequency of approx. 
80 kHz (AC firing). A small ignition capaci-
tor with a capacitance of 470 nF incorpo-
rated in the firing circuit in the firing ele-
ment plug galvanically isolates the firing 
element from the DC current. This isola-
tion from the vehicle system voltage pre-
vents inadvertent triggering, even after an 
accident when the airbag remains untrig-
gered and the occupants have to be freed 
from the deformed passenger cell by 
emergency services. It may even be neces-
sary to cut through the (permanent +) fir-
ing circuit wires in the steering column 
wiring harness and short-circuit them 
 according to positive and ground.

Passenger-compartment sensing
For passenger classification, an absolute 
weight measuring method is available with 
the iBolt (intelligent bolt). These force-
measuring iBolts (Fig. 1) secure the seat 
frame (seat link) to the sliding rail and re-
place the four mounting screws otherwise 
used. They measure the weight-dependent 
change in the gap between the bolt sleeve 
and the internal bolt with integral Hall-ele-
ment IC connected to the sliding base.

Basic principles of networking

With the tremendous speed at which 
computer technology is advancing, the 
number of electronic systems in use is 
 increasing more and more. This growth 
is also continuing in automotive engi-
neering. However, this also means that 
the complexity of an overall system (the 
vehicle in this case) is on the increase. 
 Individual systems such as engine man-
agement have been improved over the 
last few years. However, innovations are 
mainly achieved by means of interaction 
between several individual systems.  
The individual components need to be 
networked so that the multitude of infor-
mation that is managed by the individual 
systems can also be used elsewhere 
throughout the system. Different com-
munication systems are used depending 
on requirements (e.g. transmission reli-
ability, fault tolerances, costs).

Network topology

A network is understood to be a system  
in which a group of elements can exchange 
information via a transportation medium. 
If the elements are visualized as nodes and 
the communication relationships as lines, 
a picture is created of a network where 
many nodes are related to several other 
nodes. The nodes in a communication net-
work are also often referred to as network 
subscribers or stations. 

In motor vehicles, complex control units 

such as those for the engine management 
system (Motronic or electronic diesel con-
trol, EDC), the electronic stability program 
(ESP), the transmission control system  
or the door modules can be network sub-
scribers (Fig. 1). However, a sensor with a 
conditioning circuit that merely prepares 
and digitizes a measured value can also  
act as a network subscriber and make the 
measured signals available to other net-

work subscribers. The transport medium 
via which the communication takes place 
is referred to as a bus or a data bus.

A network topology is understood to be 
the structure consisting of network nodes 
and connections. This merely shows which 
nodes are interconnected, but does not de-
pict underlying details such as the length 
of the connection. Every network sub-
scriber must have at least one connection 
to another network subscriber in order  
to participate in network communication. 
Different requirements are made of the 
network topology for a variety of commu-
nication network applications, while the 
topology determines some of the charac-
teristics of the overall network. All net-
work topologies are based on the following 
four basic topologies
 ▶ Bus topology
 ▶ Star topology
 ▶ Ring topology and 
 ▶ Mesh topology

Other structures (hybrid topologies) can 
be created by combining these basic topol-
ogies. 

Bus topology
This network topology is also referred  
to as a linear bus. The core element of a 
bus topology is a single cable to which all 
nodes are connected via short connecting 
cables (Fig. 2). This topology makes it ex-
tremely easy to add other subscribers to 
the network. Information is transmitted by 
the individual bus subscribers in the form 
of so-called messages and distributed over 
the entire bus. 

Nodes transmit and receive messages.  

If a node fails, the data that is expected 
from this node is no longer available to  
the other nodes on the network. However, 
the remaining nodes can continue to ex-
change information. However, a network 
with a bus topology fails completely if the 
main line is defective (due to a cable break, 
for example).

Star topology
The star topology consists of a main node 
(repeater, hub) to which all other nodes 
are coupled via a single connection (Fig. 3). 
A network with this topology is therefore 
easy to extend if free capacity is available 
(connections, cables).

72  |  Basic principles of networking  |  Network topology

In star topologies, data is exchanged be-
tween the individual node connections  
and the main node, whereby a distinction 
is made between active and passive star 
topologies. In active star topologies, the 
main node contains a computer that pro-
cesses and relays information. The perfor-
mance capability of a network is essen-
tially determined by the performance 
 capability of this computer. However,  
the main node does not have to have spe-
cial control intelligence. In passive star 
systems, it merely connects the bus lines  
of the network subscribers together.

The following applies to active and pas-
sive stars: if a network subscriber fails or  
a connecting line to the main node is de-
fective, the rest of the network continues 
to operate. However, if the main node fails 
the entire network is disabled. 

In the automotive area, star structures 
are under discussion for safety and secu-
rity systems such as brakes and steering. 
In this case, the risk of a complete network 
failure is prevented by designing the main 
node to be physically redundant. This 
means that several main nodes are used  
to which the nodes whose information is 
needed for safe operation of the vehicle 
can be connected in parallel.

Ring topology
In the ring topology, each node is con-
nected to its two neighbors. This creates  
a closed ring (Fig. 4). A distinction can  
be made between single rings and double 
rings. 

In a single ring, data transfers are uni- 
directional from one station to the next.  
The data is checked when it is received.  
If the data is not intended for this station  
it is repeated (repeater function), boosted 
and relayed to the next station. The data 
that is being transferred is therefore re-
layed from one station to the next in the 
ring until it has reached its destination or 
arrives back at its point of origin, where  
it will then be discarded.

As a soon as a station in a single ring 
fails, the data transfer is interrupted and 
the network breaks down completely.

Rings can also be set up in the form of a 
double ring (e.g. FTTI), in which the trans-
fer of data is bidirectional. In this topology, 
the failure of a station or a connection 
 between two stations can be overcome, 
since all data is still transferred to all 
 operational stations in the ring.

However, if several stations or connec-
tions fail, the possibility of a malfunction 
cannot be ruled out.

Hybrid topologies
Hybrid topologies are a combination of 
different network topologies. Examples of 
such combination are:
 ▶ Star bus topology: the hubs of several 
star networks are interconnected as a 
linear bus (Fig. 6).

 ▶ Star ring topology: the hubs of several 

star networks are connected to the main 
hub (Fig. 7). The hubs of the star net-
work are connected in the form of a ring 
in this main hub. 

Mesh topology
In a mesh topology, each node is con-
nected to one or more other nodes (Fig. 5). 
In a fully meshed network, each node is 
connected to every other node.

If a mode or connection fails it is possi-
ble for the data to be rerouted. This type  
of network therefore has a high degree of 
system stability. However, the cost of net-
working and transporting the message is 
high.

Radio networks form a type of mesh to-
pology, since the transmissions from each 
station are received by every other station 
that is within range.

A mesh topology is bus-like as far as 
 exchanging messages is concerned, and 
star-like regarding data transfers, since 
 every station receives all transmissions 
from every other station, but connection 
failures can be overcome.

Addressing
In order to make it possible to transmit 
messages via a network and evaluate the 
contents thereof, the useful data (payload) 
that is transmitted is also accompanied by 
data transfer information. This can be ex-
plicitly contained within the transmission 
or implicitly defined using preset values. 
Addressing represents important informa-
tion for data transfer information. It is 
needed in order for a message to be sent to 
the correct recipient. There are different 
ways of doing this.

Subscriber-oriented method
The data is exchanged on the basis of node 
addresses. The message sent by the trans-
mitter contains the data to be transmitted 
and also the destination node address 
(Fig. 8a). All receivers compare the trans-
mitter receiver address to their own 
 address, and only the receiver with the 
 correct address evaluates the message.

The majority of conventional communi-
cation systems (such as Ethernet) operate 
using the subscriber addressing principle.

Adr 3

Message-oriented method
In this method it is not the receiver node 
that is addressed, but the message itself 
(Fig. 8b). Depending on the content of  
the message, it is identified by a message 
identifier that has been predefined for  
this message type. In this method, the 
transmitter does not need to know any-
thing about the destination of the message, 
since each individual receiver node de-
cides whether or not to process the mes-
sage. Of course, the message can be re-
ceived and evaluated by several nodes.

Transmission-oriented method
Transmission characteristics can also be 
used to identify a message. If a message is 
always transmitted within a defined time 
window, it can be identified on the basis  
of this position. By way of a safeguard,  
this addressing is often combined with 
message or subscriber-oriented address-
ing.

Bus access method
A node must access the bus in order to 
transmit a message. In the bus access 
method a distinction is made between
 ▶ Predictable methods in which the bus 
access is determined by certain time- 
dependent network characteristics, 
whereby only one node can transmit  
at a time and

 ▶ Random methods whereby any node  
can attempt to transmit data if the bus 
appears to be free

In the predictable method the bus access 
right is determined before bus access.  
It can thereby be ensured that only one 
subscriber is using the bus at a time. 
 Access collisions because of simultaneous 
bus usage will be prevented if all subscrib-
ers use this method.

In the random method, the nodes can 
 simultaneously attempt to use the bus as 
soon as it appears to be free. The timing  
of the bus access is therefore random. 
There is a risk of transmission collisions 
using this method, which will require at-
tention. This can be dealt with by repeat-
ing transmissions after a collision has been 
detected (e.g. Ethernet), by giving the 
transmissions different codings (CDMA), 
controlling communication via a master or 
prioritizing message types or transmitters.

Time division multiple access (TDMA)
TDMA is a deterministic (predictive) ac-
cess method. In this case each node is as-
signed a time window in which it is allowed 
to transmit (a priori). A fixed schedule  
is therefore required for the network. 
There is not usually a main communication 
subscriber controlling the communication 
procedure. However, concepts exist in 
which in which it is possible to switch be-
tween different schedules if necessary.  
The internal clocks of the different stations 
must run extremely synchronously with 
TDMA, since the transmit windows have  
to be adhered to with extreme precision.

Master-slave
In the master-slave system, one node  
on the network operates as the master. 
This node determines the communication 
frequency by interrogating its subordinate 
nodes (slaves). A slave only replies if it is 
spoken to by the master (Fig. 9). However, 
some master-slave protocols allow a slave 
to contact a master in order to transmit a 
message (e.g. transmit information about 
the position of the power-window unit to 
the door module).

Multimaster
In a Multimaster network, several nodes 
can access the transport medium indepen-
dently without the assistance of another 
node. Bus access is uncontrolled. Every 
node can access the bus and transmit a 
message if the bus appears to be free.  
This means that each node is its own mas-
ter, and that any node can start a message 
transfer with equal status. However, this 
also means that collision detection and 
handling methods have to be in place.  
For example, this may be in the form of a 
decision-making phase with prioritization 
or delayed transmission repeats. The use 
of priority control prevents a bus conflict 
if several nodes wish to use the bus at the 
same time, since the network node that  
has high priority or wishes to transmit  
a message with high priority forces its  
way through in the event of a conflict and 
transmits its message first. Normal mes-
sage transmission resumes when the line  
is free again.

The Multimaster architecture has a posi-
tive effect on the availability of the system, 
since no individual node is in control of 
communication whose failure would lead 
to total communication breakdown.

76  |  Basic principles of networking  |  OSI reference model

OSI reference model

Network protocols are usually defined  
in layers, which combine properties and 
tasks. The properties of the deeper-lying 
layers are assumed in the next level up. 
This has the advantage that individual 
 layers are exchangeable, provided that  
the  interfaces that are provided between 
the layers remain unchanged.

The ISO OSI reference model (Open 

 Systems Interconnection) provides a basis 
for describing and comparing many com-
munication protocols. This was developed 
by the ISO (International Standardization 
Organization) and led to the adoption of 
international standards by ISO and IEEE 
(Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
 Engineers).

In the OSI model, data communication 

systems are depicted in different layers 
(Fig. 10). The complex task of data commu-
nication is distributed among clearly ar-

ranged functional areas (layers). Not all of 
the layers in the OSI model are needed in a 
simple communication system. Layers can 
also be combined for many applications. 
Network protocols in the automotive area 
are often divided up into
 ▶ Physical layer
 ▶ Communication layer and
 ▶ Application layer (user layer)

Physical layer
The electrical and procedural parameters 
of the physical connection between the 
network subscribers is defined in the 
physical layer. 

Signal level
In digital technology, data is represented 
by sequences of the two binary statuses,  
0 and 1. In order to transmit the data on  
a bus, these statuses must be represented 
on the transmission agent. It is particularly 
important to avoid short-circuits on the

bus when one node is transmitting a status 
of 1 and another is transmitting a status  
of 0. 

The binary statuses can be depicted in 
many different ways. The serial interface 
of the PC, for example, uses +12 V and  
-12 V, and CAN-B uses voltages of 0 V and 
5 V. The voltages of the serial interface are 
unsuitable for a bus, since short-circuits 
can occur if several subscribers wish to 
transmit conflicting binary statuses simul-
taneously.

If the coding allows one level to over-
write another, the overwriting level is re-
ferred to as dominant, and the subordinate 
level as recessive.

It is also possible to depict dominant 
and recessive levels using visual media.  
A status of 1 (recessive) then corresponds 
to e.g. dark, and a status of 0 (dominant) 
corresponds to light. In an optical fiber,  
an individual node can override all of the 
others by feeding light into the conductor.

Bit stream 
The application information cannot usu-
ally be transmitted directly. In order to 
make transmission possible, the informa-
tion is first incorporated as a payload in 
the frame of a message that contains infor-
mation to be transmitted. Since all proto-
cols have been developed in accordance 
with different requirements, the frame 
 format differs from protocol to protocol. 
The frame needs to converted into a  
bit stream to actually transmit the infor-
mation, i.e. a sequence of bits that can be 
transmitted via the transport medium as 
physical states.

Example of the UART interface
The microcontrollers that are used in 
 control units have a simple interface 
(UART, Universal Asynchronous Receiver/
Transmitter) on the chip, via which they 
can communicate with the outside world 
(e.g. with a PC). The essential features of  
a data transmission are read out via this 
interface.

If no data is being exchanged, the bus level 
is 5 V (microcontroller operating voltage, 
Fig. 11). When the start bit is transmitted 
(dominant level), the other station con-
nected to the bus (receiver) is notified  
that a data transfer is starting (Fig. 12). 
The length of the start bit determines a  
bit time that represents the basis for the 
entire data transfer. Every subsequent  
data bit has the same length. The recipro-
cal of this time corresponds to the data 
transfer rate, i.e. the number of bits that 
can be transmitted in one second in a 
 continuous data stream. All participat-
ing stations must be set to the same data 
transfer rate.

After the start bit has been received,  

the transmission of an 8-bit data word 
commences (1 byte) with the lowest signif-
icant bit (LSB, Low Significant Bit). The re-
ceiver that has synchronized itself to the 
start bit scans the data bus between each 
data bit and therefore assembles the trans-
ferred data byte. 

The eighth data bit is followed by the 
parity bit. This bit indicates whether the 
number of transmitted ones is odd or even. 
It therefore allows the receiver to perform 
a simple check for possible transmission 
errors. The sequence is completed with 
the stop bit, which is placed onto the bus

with a dominant level. The next data trans-
fer can then take place.

Control mechanisms

Communication layer
Control units can only interconnect and 
exchange data if they speak the same 
 “language”. This language determines  
the rules that are used to exchange data 
between the individual network sub-
scribers. 

The communication layer accepts data 
from the application layer, prepares it for 
transmission and forwards it to the physi-
cal layer.

The essential features of this protocol 

layer are:
 ▶ Message frame format
 ▶ Bus access control
 ▶ Message addressing
 ▶ Detection and handling of collisions
 ▶ Network node synchronization
 ▶ Checksum calculation

Application layer
The application layer consists of the appli-
cation that processes and provides the in-
formation. The application layer is the only 
protocol layer to be affected by user or 
sensor input. 

Event control
In an event-driven bus system, messages 
are transmitted as soon as an event that 
triggers the transmission of a message  
has occurred (Fig. 13a). Examples of such 
events are: 
 ▶ Pressing a button on the air conditioning 

system control panel 

 ▶ Operating the hazard warning flasher 

switch

 ▶ Incoming message that requires a reac-
tion (e.g. information from rpm sensor 
to speedometer needle motor) 

 ▶ Expiration of a fixed time period (time 
frame, e.g. 100 ms), after which mes-
sages are transmitted cyclically 

Since the stations are not synchronized 
with each other, situations where several 
stations wish to access the bus simultane-
ously are unavoidable. In order to allow

a message to be transmitted without falsifi-
cation, only one station at a time can trans-
mit data on the bus. Collision avoidance 
mechanisms are available for preventing 
or solving bus conflicts. 

If a node wishes to transmit a message 
whilst the bus is occupied, the transmis-
sion is delayed (Fig. 13b). A station that is 
ready to transmit must then wait until the 
transmission that is currently in progress 
has been completed. 

Since bus access is subsequently rene-
gotiated, the transmission may be delayed 
yet again. These delays become problem-
atic if the bus becomes overloaded by a 
large number of network subscribers that 
wish to transmit messages. In this case 
messages may be lost if the transmitter 
abandons the transmission due to exces-
sive delays.

Event-driven bus systems are suitable 
for reacting to asynchronous (unforeseen) 
events as quickly as possible. In an ideal 
case, they reduce the delay between the 
occurrence of the event and the message 
transmission (latency time) compared to 
time-driven systems. However, the latency 
time can vary considerably depending on 
the network loading.

Advantages
 ▶ High level of flexibility and capability of 
retrofitting new nodes in the network
 ▶ Good response time to asynchronous 

external events

 ▶ Bus usage depending on event fre-
quency in line with requirements

 ▶ No network loading by unused events, 
since only events that have actually 
 occurred trigger a transmission

Disadvantages
 ▶ Static bus occupancy, non-deterministic 
(i.e. not possible to prove that a message 
was transmitted at the right time)

Timer control
In the most recent developments in dy-
namic driving systems such as brakes and 
steering, an increasing number of mechan-
ical and hydraulic components are being 
replaced with electronic systems (x-by-
wire). Mechanical connections such as  
the steering column are becoming super-
fluous, and the functionality thereof is be-
ing taken over by sensors and actuators.  
The reliability, safety and failure tolerance 
requirements of these systems are ex-
tremely high. This means: 
 ▶ Messages must be received on time
 ▶ The latency time of critical messages 

must be extremely small

 ▶ The system must have a redundant 

 design

 ▶ The failure of a node must affect the rest 
of the system as little as possible and
 ▶ It must be possible to achieve a safe op-
erating status from any fault situation

X-by-wire systems require close network-
ing by the various components. The exter-
nal increase in complexity places new de-
mands on the safety, failure tolerance and 
availability of the communication system. 
The demands that are made of the elec-
tronic and network architecture therefore 
also increase. A reliable, fault-tolerant net-
work architecture is required so that data 
is transmitted with guaranteed transmis-
sion characteristics, and electronic system 
malfunctions are handled in the most effi-
cient way. 

System architectures for real-time applica-
tions meet these requirements because 
their behavior is predictable and verifiable 
because of the way in which they are con-
structed. In these protocols, time windows 
within which a node is permitted to trans-
mit are assigned to the control units in the 
communication network (nodes) during 
network planning (Fig. 14). In order to com-
ply with the time window, the nodes must 
be synchronized as precisely as possible.

Advantages
 ▶ Deterministic system 
 ▶ Punctual data transmission
 ▶ Reliable detection and isolation of 

 defective network nodes

Disadvantages
 ▶ Overall system must be planned for 

 distributed developments

 ▶ Capacity for expanding the communica-

tion system must be planned in

 ▶ Good response time to asynchronous 

external events

Composability
If a communication system allows inde-
pendently developed subsystems to be 
 integrated in an overall system, it is said  
to support composability. An important 
criterion when doing this is that the prop-
erties that have been assured for the func-
tionality of a subsystem are not adversely 
affected by adding other subsystems.  
If this has been ensured, the checking  
of system functionality is restricted to 
 subsystem checking that can be carried 
out by the constructor of the subsystem.
If a communication system supports 
composability, changes can be made to a 
control unit without affecting the function-
ality of other control units. It is therefore 
not necessary to recheck the entire system 
after integrating a modified control unit –  
it is sufficient to check that the individual 
subsystems are operating reliably. Com-
posability therefore reduces the time and 
cost of integrating new subsystems. This is 
the only way to increase the complexity of 
the electronics in the vehicle.

All transmissions are processed sequen-
tially in accordance with the network plan-
ning (without collisions). Once each node 
has transmitted its message, the cycle re-
starts with the first transmitter. This makes 
it possible to determine how chronologi-
cally up-to-date the data is at any time. 
Since missing messages are detected 
immediately, time-triggered concepts are 
more reliable than event-driven systems.
If a fast data rate is required in a time-
triggered system, the time delay between 
the occurrence of an event and the trans-
mission of the data can be so small that  
the system complies with strict real-time 
requirements.

The bus can be protected from unau-
thorized access by a bus guardian. The bus 
guardian prevents a defective node from 
interfering with network communication 
by transmitting messages outside the rele-
vant transmit window.

These characteristics make it possible  
to create redundant, fault tolerant systems 
in which transmission errors can be reme-
died and faults in the network can picked 
up by network nodes that can provide the 
functionality without errors.

82  |  Automotive networking  |  Cross-system functions

Automotive networking

Electrical and electronic systems in 
 motor vehicles are often not indepen-
dent of each other but influence and 
complement each other. For this reason, 
signal lines were used in previous injec-
tion and ignition systems in order to 
 simplify communication between these 
two systems. However, the increasing 
number of electronic systems rapidly 
 increased the demand for and the scope 
of the information that was being ex-
changed. The number of signal lines  
and plug connections that is required 
 increased accordingly, meaning that the 
technology that has so far been used was 
approaching the limit of its capability.

The solution was provided by the develop-
ment of serial bus systems, with which 
large volumes of data from different 
sources can be transferred. A serial bus 
system was first used in a vehicle in 1991, 
when the CAN bus was used in the 
 Mercedes-Benz 500E. 

The demand for additional driving 

safety, convenience, economy and stricter 
legal requirements on the environmental 
compatibility of motor vehicles can only 
be achieved with the aid of additional elec-
tronics. The number of electronic systems 
in vehicles is therefore increasing all the 
time (Fig. 2).

1 Automotive networking

Cross-system functions 

If you examine the signals that are pro-
cessed in the individual systems, it be-
comes evident that many signals are 
needed in several control units. For exam-
ple, the driving speed is evaluated in the 
electronic stability program (ESP) for the 
vehicle dynamics control, in the engine 
management for the automatic speed 
 control (cruise control) and in the car 
sound system for the speed-dependent 
volume control. 

The preparation of these variables from 
sensor signals requires computing power 
and therefore hardware and software re-
sources. It is therefore advisable for these 
variables always to be calculated in a con-
trol unit and transmitted to other control 
units via a communication network.

However, in order to implement cross-
system functions, electronic systems can 
also exchange information and therefore 
influence each other. Intelligent sensors 
are also considered to be electronic sys-
tems that prepare the sensor signal in an 
evaluation circuit and put the information 
on the data bus via a bus interface. Pre-
crash sensors detect a pending collision, 
for example; the airbag control unit then 
sends the door modules and the overhead 
control panel a request to close the windows

and the sliding roof. This protects the 
 occupants from penetrating objects.

Another example of a system-encom-
passing function is the adaptive cruise 
control (ACC), in which the radar sensor, 
the engine management, the electronic 
stability program (ESP) and the transmis-
sion control communicate with each other. 
Distance control from the vehicle in front 
that is adapted to the flow of traffic is 
made possible in this system by means  
of engine torque adjustments, automatic 
brake system intervention and gear 
 selection. 

Coordination between the individual 
systems is therefore required for cross-
system functions. Large volumes of data 
must be exchanged to do this. As well as 
powerful components, a powerful commu-
nication system is also required, with a 
low-cost network that is suitable for auto-
motive vehicles. Special serial databus sys-
tems have been developed for this purpose. 

The use of bus systems has the following 
advantages in comparison to a solution 
that uses conventional wiring:
 ▶ Reduced costs with less weight and in-

stallation space because of fewer cables 
in the wiring harness

 ▶ Better reliability and functional reliabil-
ity due to fewer plug-in connections

 ▶ Simplification of vehicle assembly 

 during production

 ▶ Multiple use of sensor signals
 ▶ Simple connection of system compo-

nents to a bus

 ▶ Easier handling of equipment and spe-
cial equipment variants in a vehicle

Requirements for  
bus systems

Both financial (e.g. cable costs, component 
costs) and technical constraints must be 
taken into consideration when a bus sys-
tem is being selected. The most important 
technical selection criteria are explained 
in the following.

Data transfer rate
This variable specifies the volume of data 
that is transmitted during a time unit. The 
smallest unit of data is the bit, and the data 
transfer rate is usually specified in bits/sec-
onds. Alternative names for this expression 
are transfer rate, data rate or bit rate.

The required data rate is dependent on 

the application. A slower transfer rate is 
required to switch the air-conditioning 
compressor on and off than to transfer 
 audio signals, for example.

Interference immunity
Ideally, the data should be transferred 
without interference. However, this cannot 
be guaranteed in a motor vehicle because 
of electromagnetic effects. The interfer-
ence immunity requirements that are 
made depend on the safety relevance of 
the electronic systems concerned. Lesser 
requirements are made of comfort and

convenience systems than the antilock 
brake system (ABS), for example.

In order to meet these requirements, 
mechanisms that detect transmission er-
rors are incorporated in the network pro-
tocols. A simple check can be carried out 
using the parity bit, which is calculated in 
the transmitter and is transmitted together 
with the useful data. This specifies whether 
the number of 1’s in the transferred byte is 
even or off. This information is checked by 
the receiver. Single errors can be detected 
using this method. 

Another method is the checksum check. 
If several data bytes are being transmitted, 
the transmitter calculates a checksum 
from the individual data bytes using a pre-
defined formula and transmits this value. 
The receiver also calculates the checksum 
of the data bytes that have been received 
and compares it with the checksum that has 
been received. If a data transmission error 
is detected, the received data is not used 
and a repeat transmission is requested.

Real-time capability
A real-time system guarantees that its re-
sults are calculated within a fixed time in-
terval. The duration of the time interval 
depends on the application. The antilock 
brake system (ABS) must react to the 
 incipient locking of a wheel within a few 
milliseconds (wheel speed reduction), 
whereas response times of 100 ms are 
 adequate for actuating the power-window 
motor. Human beings cannot perceive 
 delay periods of less than 100 ms.

Different demands are made of real-time 

behavior depending on the application: 
 ▶ Soft real-time requirement: the system 
generally adheres to the specified re-
sponse time, and if these times are occa-
sionally exceeded, it does not produce 
any serious effects (e.g. image jerking 
during picture transmission).

 ▶ Hard real-time requirement: the time 

specification must be strictly adhered  
to. If the specified response time was ex-
ceeded, the calculated result would not 
be able to be used. This can lead to seri-
ous problems in safety-critical systems. 

For example, if time allowances were ex-
ceeded in the ABS system, the incipient 
locking of the wheels would not be de-
tected soon enough and the pressure in 
the master cylinder would not be reduced 
in time. This would result in locked wheels.
The time allowances must also be strictly 
adhered to for many engine-management 
system functions. Delays in transmitting 
injection and ignition signals could lead  
to engine judder and even misfiring.  
These reactions must be avoided, since 
they represent a potential danger. Hard 
real-time requirements must therefore be 
made of these systems. 

However, this does not necessarily mean 
that the transmission of data via a bus sys-
tem also has to be subject to these hard 
real-time requirements. Adherence to  
soft real-time requirements is usually suf-
ficient. If signals from other control units 
are needed for functions (e.g. a torque re-
duction request during a shift operation), 
the bus system must transmit the data at  
a faster data transfer speed and with a 
smaller time delay so that the overall sys-
tem complies with the specified real-time 
requirements.

Number of network nodes
The maximum number of nodes to be inte-
grated varies for different areas of vehicle 
operation. The number of nodes for com-
fort and convenience systems may be high 
due to servomotor networking (e.g. seat 
adjustment) and intelligent sensors (e.g. 
rain sensors). Several identical busses can 
be used if necessary.

The overall vehicle system can be divided 
into four domains or functional areas from 
the point of view or electrics/electronics:
 ▶ Drivetrain
 ▶ Chassis
 ▶ Interior and
 ▶ Telematics

In the drivetrain and chassis domains,  
the emphasis is primarily on real-time 
 applications. In the interior domain, the 
main focus is on multiplex aspects in net-
working. Mainly multimedia and infotain-
ment applications are networked in the 
telematics domain.

Real-time applications
The networking of these systems makes 
considerable demands of the performance 
capability of the communication system. 
Crankshaft-synchronous processes or pro-
cesses within a fixed time frame with cycle 
times of a few milliseconds are typical.  
If the system response times are adequate 
for the task in hand, it is described as hav-
ing real-time capability (e.g. rapid ignition-
timing advance in the Motronic after a re-
quest from the traction-control system for 
reducing torque and therefore preventing 
the wheel from spinning).

Multimedia networking
Mobile communication applications com-
bine components such as
 ▶ Car sound system
 ▶ CD changer
 ▶ Navigation system
 ▶ Driver-information systems
 ▶ Telephone
 ▶ Video system
 ▶ Voice input
 ▶ Internet, E-mail
 ▶ Back-up camera

The networking of these components 
makes it possible to have a centrally lo-
cated display and control unit for several 
applications. Operating procedures can  
be standardized in this way, and status 
 information can be summarized. Driver 
distraction is therefore minimized.

A distinction must be made between con-
trol data and audio/video data in multime-
dia networking. Transfer rates of up to 
125 kBit/s are sufficient for control tasks 
(such as CD changer control), meaning that 
the low-speed CAN bus can be used, for 
example. The direct transmission of audio 
or video data requires extremely high 
transfer rates of more than 10 MBit/s.  
The MOST bus is used for this purpose,  
for example. 

The drivetrain and chassis systems are 
 assigned to class C. These require fast 
transfer rates in order to ensure the real-
time behavior that is required for these 
applications. They also make considerable 
fault tolerance demands. These require-
ments are met by the event-driven CAN 
bus with a transfer rate of 500 kBaud 
(high-speed CAN). 

Examples:
 ▶ Engine-management system (Motronic 

or electronic diesel control, EDC) 

 ▶ Transmission control
 ▶ Antilock brake systems, ABS
 ▶ Vehicle dynamics control (e.g. electronic 

stability program, ESP)

 ▶ Chassis control systems (e.g. active body 

 ▶ Support systems (e.g. adaptive cruise 

control, ABC)

control, ACC)

Multiplex applications
The multiplex application is suitable for 
controlling and regulating components in 
the body and comfort and convenience 
electronics area (class B), such as
 ▶ Displays
 ▶ Lighting
 ▶ Access authorization with anti-theft 

warning device
 ▶ Air-conditioning
 ▶ Seat and mirror adjustment
 ▶ Door module (power-window unit,  

door-mirror adjustment)

 ▶ Windshield wipers
 ▶ Headlamp adjustment

The transfer rate requirements are not  
as high for class B systems as they are for  
class C systems. For this reason, low-speed 
CAN with a transfer rate of 125 kBit/s or 
single-wire CAN with 33 kBit/s. can be used.
If the transfer rate requirements drop 
to less than 20 kBit/s, the low-cost LIN is 
more frequently used. Applications are 
mainly in the mechatronics area; examples 
being the transfer of switch information or 
the activation of actuators.

Coupling of networks

The network topologies and protocols that 
are most suitable for requirements are 
used for the different applications. How-
ever, the different network protocols are 
incompatible, meaning that data cannot be 
simply exchanged between networks. 

In this case, help is provided by a gate-
way. A gateway can be compared to an in-
terpreter that receives the “data” from a 
discussion partner, translates it and passes 
it to another discussion partner. Techni-
cally speaking a gateway is a computer 
that reads in the data that is transmitted  
by the networks and converts it into an-
other format. The use of gateways there-
fore makes it possible to exchange infor-
mation between different networks. 

A central gateway (Fig. 4a) or several 
distributed gateways can be used (Fig. 4b) 
to interconnect the bus systems. All bus 
lines are routed to the central gateway.  
In the other case, one gateway connects 
two or more busses.

Examples of networked 
vehicles

Topology
The topologies of the communication net-
works can differ considerably depending 
on the vehicle equipment. Figures 5 and 6 
show examples of how the network can  
be designed for different vehicle classes. 
In some cases, different car manufacturers 
use different bus systems for communica-
tion.

Signal transmission
Signal types
A wide variety of information can be trans-
mitted in a communication network in a 
vehicle. Some examples are: 
 ▶ Engine operating conditions (e.g. engine 
temperature, engine speed, engine load) 

 ▶ Physical measurements recorded by 
sensors (e.g. outside temperature) 
 ▶ Control signals for activating servo-
motors (e.g. power-window units) or

 ▶ Control element switch positions  
(e.g. for the windshield wiper)

Resolution
The signals must be available with a suit-
able resolution. Switch positions can sim-
ply be shown as a 1-bit value (0 for switch 
open, 1 for switch closed). Other signals 
such as digitized analog voltages from the 
engine-temperature sensor or the calcu-
lated engine speed are shown as 1-byte or 
2-byte values, for example, depending on 
resolution requirements. One byte can be 
used to represent 256 values, and two 
bytes can be used to represent 65, 536 val-
ues (= 256?256). The resolution for sensor 
signals with a voltage range of 0 to 5 V is 
approximately 20 mV with a 1 byte repre-
sentation (= 5 V/256). A resolution of 5 mV 
requires a 10-bit data representation.
The conversion between the binary 
value and the physical value must be uni-
form so that the transferred signals repre-
sent the same physical value in all systems. 
A resolution of 30 rpm is sufficient for ac-
cessing the ignition map as far as the en-
gine speed n is concerned. A value range 
of 0 to 255?30 rpm (= 7, 650 rpm) and 
therefore the entire speed range can 
 consequently be represented by one  
byte (8 bits). An incrementation of 30 rpm 
is too little for idle-speed control, on the 
other hand. More bits are required to rep-
resent the signal with a higher resolution, 
provided that the same measuring range  
is being recorded.

Output
In event-driven systems such as the ones 
that are primarily used in the automotive 
area, the signals can be transferred on the 
data bus when an event occurs. Examples 
of such events are the operation of 
switches for switching on the air-condi-
tioning system or the windshield wiper. 
Signals that represent the operating 
state of the engine, for example, are not 
necessarily associated with an event. The 
engine temperature, which only changes 
slowly, is cyclically measured in a fixed 
time frame by the engine control unit  
(e.g. 1 second). The engine speed, on the 

other hand, can change extremely rapidly. 
The times at which the engine manage-
ment carries out measurements and calcu-
lations depends on the crankshaft position 
and is performed once per combustion 
 cycle. At fast engine speeds, this corre-
sponds to a time interval of a few milli-
seconds, i.e. approx. 3.3 ms at an engine 
speed of 6,000 rpm for a 6-cylinder en-
gine. However, not every system that needs 
the speed information for its control and 
regulation functions depends on this avail-
ability. The engine control unit therefore 
does not need to output the speed infor-
mation on the data bus as soon as it is cal-
culated. In this case too, data transmission 
takes place according to a cyclic time 
frame. A time frame of 10 ms is normal in 
the engine control area. This means that 
the speed information is transmitted on 
the bus 100 times per second.

Data transfer: examples
The following examples show which sig-
nals are measured and evaluated in which 
systems.

Driving speed 
The ESP control unit calculates the driving 
speed from the wheel-speed sensors. This 
variable is transmitted on the CAN-C bus 
(drive CAN). The engine-management sys-
tem needs this value for the cruise control, 
among other things, and the transmission 
control unit determines gear changes from 
the driving speed. The adaptive cruise 
control (ACC) needs the current driving 
speed to calculate the necessary distance 
from the vehicle in front and use it as a 
 setpoint value.

A gateway transmits the speed informa-
tion via another CAN bus (instrument clus-
ter CAN) to the instrument cluster, which 
displays the value via a needle instrument. 
The CAN-B bus (comfort CAN) is also 
connected to the network via the gateway. 
Some luxury class vehicles are equipped 
with dynamic seats. The padding of the 
seats is inflated depending on the speed 

90  |  Automotive networking  |  Examples of networked vehicles

and the acceleration, counteracting the 
centrifugal force of the driver. This in-
creases comfort considerably when 
 cornering.

The speed information is sent to the Info-
tainment CAN via the gateway and relayed 
to the car sound system. This allows the 
volume to be adapted to the driving speed. 
The navigation system needs the speed to 
calculate the position if the GPS signal is 
missing (e.g. in a tunnel).

The diagnosis interface is directly con-
nected to the engine and transmission con-
trol unit via the serial K-line. All other con-
trol units are connected to the diagnosis 
interface via a virtual K-line that is simu-
lated on the CAN bus. This allows the driv-
ing speed to be read out in the workshop 
via the connected diagnostic tester (exam-
ple: the correct assignment of the wheel-
speed sensors must be checked for the 
ABS functional test).

Engine speed
The injection and (with a gasoline engine) 
the ignition timing are output with a reso-
lution of less than 1° of the crankshaft an-
gle. In order to ensure real-time behavior, 
the crankshaft position must be recorded 
in the engine control unit. The engine-
speed sensor scans the crankshaft trigger 
wheel and relays the signal to the control 
unit, which calculates both the crankshaft 
position and the engine speed. This vari-
able is used to calculate the injection time 
and the ignition angle, for example.

The engine speed is a variable that is 
needed in many other systems. The engine 
control unit therefore outputs it on the 
data bus. The shifting points are defined in 
the transmission control unit depending 
on the speed. The engine speed is needed 
for the TCS function (Traction-Control Sys-
tem) in the electronic stability program 
(ESP) – TCS intervention (torque reduc-
tion) must not make the engine stall.

As in the previous example, the engine 
speed is transmitted to the diagnosis inter-

face and the instrument cluster (display on 
the rev counter).

Turn signaling
The driver operates the turn signal lever 
(Fig. 6, Item 1). A signal is relayed to the 
steering column control unit (2) via a 
 discrete line depending on whether the 
driver is indicating a right or left turn.  
This may be a resistance-coded signal,  
for example. The control unit evaluates  
the signal and detects that the driver is 
 indicating a left turn, for example. 

The comfort CAN relays this information 

to the vehicle electrical system control  
unit (3). The indication direction is defined 
on the basis of the received information 
(normal flash frequency, increased flash 
frequency in the event of bulb failure).  
The front left and rear left turn-signal 
lamps (4, 5) are then actuated via discrete 
lines. The vehicle electrical system control 
unit also transmits the “left turn signaling” 
information on the comfort CAN. The gate-
way (6) relays the information to the in-
strument cluster CAN. The indicator lamp 
then flashes on the instrument cluster (9).
If the vehicle has a trailer hitch, the in-
formation goes to the trailer recognition 
control unit (7) via the comfort CAN.  
This actuates the turn-signal lamp on  
the trailer (8) via cables.

Wiper stage 1
The wiper switch (Fig. 7, Item 1) transmits 
a signal via a discrete line to the steering 
column control unit (2), which evaluates 
the information (e.g. wiper stage 1). The 
control unit transmits this information on 
the comfort CAN bus. The vehicle electrical 
system control unit (3) picks up the infor-
mation and relays it to the wiper motor (4) 
via the LIN bus. The vehicle electrical sys-
tem control unit acts as a gateway between 
the comfort CAN and the wiper LIN.

Load management
At low revs (idle speed) and when a con-
siderable amount of power is being used 
up by the electrical consumers that are 
switched on, the battery or alternator volt-
age can drop to a low value. The vehicle 
electrical system control unit calculates the 
current status of the vehicle electrical sys-
tem from the current battery voltage, the 
DF signal from the alternator (alternator 
utilization) and the information about 
heavy current consumers that are 

switched on with a short switch-on dura-
tion. The vehicle electrical system control 
unit requests an idle speed increase via 
the CAN bus if the vehicle electrical system 
is insufficient at idle speed. The engine 
control unit implements the request.  
If this action does not solve the problem, 
the vehicle electrical system control unit 
switches off specific consumers such as 
the heated rear windshield, the seat heat-
ing or the heated outside mirror. These 
consumers are connected to the  vehicle 
electrical system control unit via  discrete 
lines.
 
Multimedia application
Audio and video data is transmitted in dig-
ital form via the optical MOST bus (Media 
Orientated System Transport) (Fig. 5). The 
information is therefore transmitted with 
high quality. A fast transfer rate ensures 
that large volumes of data are transferred 
reliably. A wide variety of multimedia in-
formation can be transmitted to different 
terminals via a cable.

Bus systems

CAN bus

In 1991 the CAN bus (Controller Area 
 Network) was the first bus system to be 
 introduced to a motor vehicle in mass 
 production. It has since established itself 
as the standard system in the automotive 
sector, but the CAN bus is also commonly 
used as a field bus in automation engineer-
ing in general. In imitation of other net-
work types, such as the local area network 
(LAN), wide area network (WAN) or per-
sonal area network (PAN), this bus system 
was given the name, CAN.

Applications
The CAN bus is used in various domains in 
the motor vehicle. These domains differ in 
the requirements they demand of the net-
work. Due to the fast processes involved in 
the area of engine management, informa-
tion is required much faster here than in 
the area of comfort/convenience where  
the controlled systems are located further 
apart and as such lines are more prone

to damage. As a result of these different 
 requirements, buses with different data 
rates are used that offer an optimum cost-
benefit ratio for the field of application 
concerned. A distinction is made between 
high-speed and low-speed CAN buses.

High-speed CAN (CAN-C)
CAN-C is defined in ISO Standard 11898-2 
and operates at bit rates of 125 kBit/s to 
1 MBit/s. The data transfer is therefore 
able to meet the real-time requirements  
of the drivetrain.

CAN-C buses are used for networking 

the following systems:
 ▶ Engine-management system (Motronic 
for gasoline engines or EDC for diesel 
engines)

 ▶ Electronic transmission control
 ▶ Vehicle stabilization systems (e.g. ESP)
 ▶ Instrument cluster

Low-speed CAN (CAN-B)
CAN-B is defined in ISO Standard 11898-3 
and operates at a bit rate of 5 to 125 kBit/s. 
For many applications in the comfort/con-
venience and body area, this speed is suffi-
cient to meet the real-time requirements 
demanded in this area. Examples of such 
applications are:
 ▶ Control of the air-conditioning system
 ▶ Seat adjustment
 ▶ Power-window unit
 ▶ Sliding-sunroof control
 ▶ Mirror adjuster
 ▶ Lighting system
 ▶ Control of the navigation system

The CAN bus is finding ever more use in 
vehicle diagnostics. Here, the electronic 
control unit is connected directly to the 
CAN bus and thus receives the information 
it needs for diagnostics immediately. Pre-
vious diagnosis interfaces (e.g. KWP2000) 
are becoming less important.

Topology
Bus topology
In the development of the CAN, particular 
focus was placed on eliminating the need 
for a central control element for communi-
cation. This approach is most effectively 
supported by a bus topology in which all 
network nodes are connected to a bus and 
each node is able to receive all information 
sent on the bus. The bus topology is most 
commonly selected during the conceptual 
design of the communications system.

In addition to offering favorable electri-

cal properties, the linear bus topology  
has the advantage that the failure of one 
station would not affect the functionality 
of the data transmission system. Further-
more, additional stations can be connected 
to the system with little extra effort.

Star topology
The use of a central coupler makes it pos-
sible to build star topologies. Active as well 
as passive couplers can be used. The use  
of a star topology achieves a high level of 
flexibility in adapting to the networking 
task. 

The coupler is used to build a star topol-

ogy and simply forwards the messages to 
the individual segments. Since the signal 
transit times remain unchanged, the cir-
cuit length of the star topology is the same 
as that of a bus topology.

Data transmission system
Network nodes
A network node (Fig. 2) comprises the mi-
crocontroller for the application software, 
the CAN controller and the CAN trans-
ceiver (bus driver). The CAN controller is 
responsible for the transmit and receive 
modes. It generates the bit stream for  
data communication from the binary data 
to be transmitted and forwards it to the 
transceiver on the TxD line. This amplifies 
the signals, generates the voltage level re-
quired for differential data transfer and 
transmits the processed bit stream serially 
on the bus line (CAN_H and CAN_L). 

 Incoming messages are processed by the 
transceiver and sent to the CAN controller 
on the RxD line.

The microcontroller, which runs the ap-
plication program (e.g. Motronic), controls 
the CAN controller, prepares the data to be 
sent and evaluates the data received. 

Logic bus states and coding
CAN uses two states for communication, 
dominant and recessive, with which the 
 information bits are transmitted. The dom-
inant state represents a binary “0”, the 
 recessive a binary “1”. NRZ (Non-Return to 
Zero) is used as the encoding method for 
the data transmission. With this method, 
there is no compulsory return to zero be-
tween two transmission states of the same 
value.

When it receives messages, the  

CAN transceiver converts the signal level 
back to logical states. In the process, a 
 differential amplifier subtracts the CAN_L 
level from the CAN_H level (Fig. 3). If lines 
 become twisted, disturbance pulses (e.g. 
from the ignition system) have the same 
 effect on both lines. Differential data trans-
fer therefore makes it possible to filter out 
interference on the line.

age level on the CAN_H and CAN_L line 
separately. It would then be possible for 
operation to continue in single-line mode 
if one of the two bus lines were to fail as 
a consequence of a short-circuit or cable 
break. However, the bus subscribers would 
have to share a common ground that would 
assume the function of the failed line.

Transmission agent and bus coupling 
Two-wire line
For the CAN, any transmission agent on 
which dominant and recessive states can 
be transmitted is worthy of consideration. 
An untwisted or twisted pair of wires, de-
pending on the ambient conditions, is usu-
ally used, and the wires are either galvani-
cally coupled or decoupled. The two bus 
lines are designated CAN_H and CAN_L. 
The two-wire line supports symmetrical 
data transfer whereby the bits are sent on 
both bus lines and represented by differ-
ent voltages. This reduces sensitivity to  
in-phase interference because the interfer-
ence affects both lines equally and can be 
filtered out. Additional shielding of the 
lines reduces their own radiation emis-
sions, especially at high baud rates.

Single-wire line
The single-wire line is a means of reducing 
manufacturing costs by dispensing with 
the second line. For this to be possible, 
however, all bus subscribers must share  
a common ground that would assume the 
function of the second line. The single-
wire version of the CAN bus is therefore 
only an option for a communications sys-
tem of limited spatial dimensions.

The data transfer on the single-wire line 
is more prone to interference radiation be-
cause it is not possible to filter out distur-
bance pulses as it is with the two-wire line. 
For this reason, a higher level increase is 
required on the bus line to improve the 
signal-to-noise ratio. This in turn has a 
negative effect on interference radiation. 
The flank steepness of the bus signals 
must therefore be reduced in comparison 
to the two-wire line. This is accompanied 
by a lower data transfer rate. Conse-
quently, the single-wire line is only used 
for the low-speed CAN in the body elec-
tronics and comfort/convenience electron-
ics. Thanks to this feature, a low-speed 
CAN with two-wire line would still remain 
functional in the event of a line failure 
(CAN_H or CAN_L).

Emission limits
To permit correct evaluation of bit trans-
mission, the signal must arrive at each 
node within the bit time without interfer-
ence, and yet still at the relevant sampling 
point. Delays arise from the signal transit 
time on the data bus. The maximum per-
missible bit rate thus depends on the total 
length of the bus. ISO 11898 specifies  
the bit rate for a defined circuit length.  
The following recommendations exist for 
longer lines.
 ▶ 1 MBits/s for 40 m (specified)
 ▶ 500 kBits/s up to 100 m  

(recommendation)

 ▶ 250 kBits/s up to 250 m
 ▶ 125 kBits/s up to 500 m
 ▶ 40 kBits/s up to 1,000 m

It is possible to connect at least 30 network 
nodes to the bus without the need for ad-
ditional measures.

Voltage level
The CAN transceiver converts the logical 
states 0 and 1 received by the CAN control-
ler into voltage levels that are fed to the 
CAN_H and CAN_L bus lines. 

The high-speed and low-speed CANs use 

different voltage levels for the transmis-
sion of dominant and recessive states.  
The voltage levels of the low-speed CAN 
are shown in Figure 4a, those of the high-
speed CAN in Figure 4b.

In the recessive state, the high-speed 
CAN uses a voltage of 2.5 V on both lines. 
In the dominant state, a voltage of 3.5 V is 
present on CAN_H and a voltage of 1.5 V is 
present on CAN_L.

On the low-speed CAN, a voltage of 0 V 
is present on CAN_H in the recessive state, 
and 5 V on CAN_L. In the dominant state, 
voltages of 3.6 V and 1.4 V are present on 
the CAN_H and CAN_L respectively.

Reflection-free termination
Reflections of the electrical signals at open 
ends of lines would interfere with commu-
nication. To dampen these reflections, the 
bus lines are terminated at each end with  
a resistor of 120 V. 

Alternatively, the terminating resistors 
may be integrated into the electronic con-
trol units themselves.

CAN protocol
Protocol layers
For communications protocols, it is 
 standard practice to arrange thematically 
 coherent tasks as a set of layers, which af-
fords a high level of flexibility in the imple-
mentation of a bus system. With the CAN, 
both the CAN hardware and the CAN soft-
ware are subdivided into several layers 
(Fig. 6).

Application layer
The application layer represents the infor-
mation in the form of data structures used 
by the application. These sets of data 
which are to be transmitted are forwarded 
to the object layer for this purpose.

Object layer
The task of the object layer is to manage 
the messages. The functions of this layer 
are used to decide which message should 
be sent at which time. For incoming mes-
sages, this layer is responsible for message 
filtering.

Transport layer
The transport layer furnishes the object 
layer with received messages and pro-
cesses the messages prepared by the ob-
ject layer for sending in such a way that  
the physical layer is able to transmit this

information. To fulfill this purpose, the 
transport layer is responsible for such 
functions as arbitration or fault detection 
and signaling.

Physical layer
The physical layer is the lowest level in the 
transport stack. It consists of the physical 
components of the network, such as the 
wiring and the voltages used to send the 
information.

Multimaster principle
The CAN protocol supports communica-
tion between network nodes without the 
need for a central control unit. Each node 
may attempt to send messages at any time. 
Whether this attempt is successful or not 
essentially depends on two factors:
 ▶ Is the bus free before the start of trans-

 ▶ Has the arbitration phase been passed 

mission? 

successfully?

This design ensures that, even if any num-
ber of nodes were to fail, it can still be de-
termined whether a node is authorized to 
send.

Content-based addressing
Unlike other networks, the CAN does not 
address the individual network nodes but 
the messages that have been sent. Each 
message has a unique marker, or identifier. 
The identifier classifies the content of the 
message (e.g. engine speed or power-win-
dow position). A station is therefore able 
to broadcast a message to all other stations 
(multicast or broadcast method). These 
stations read only those messages whose 
identifiers are stored in their acceptance 
list (message filtering, Fig. 7). In this way, 
each station decides for itself whether or 
not it needs a message sent on the bus. 
The identifier has 11 bits (standard format, 
CAN 2.0 A) or 29 bits (extended format, 
CAN 2.0 B). With 11 bits in the standard 
format, it is possible to distinguish be-
tween 2,048 different CAN messages;  

Bus systems  |  CAN bus  |  97

in the extended format, this number rises 
to over 536 million.

The advantage of this addressing 

method is that the network nodes do not 
require any information about system 
 configuration and are thus free to operate 
fully independently of each other. This re-
sults in a highly flexible complete system, 
which makes it easier to manage equip-
ment variants. If one of the ECUs requires 
new information which is already on the 
bus, all it needs to do is call it up from the 
bus. It is possible to integrate additional 
stations into the system (provided they are 
receivers) without having to modify the 
 existing stations.

Controlling bus access
Arbitration phase
If the bus is unoccupied (recessive state) 
and messages are available for sending, 
each station is free to initiate the sending 
of its message. The message begins with a 
dominant bit (start-of-frame bit), followed 
by the identifier. When several stations 
start to transmit simultaneously, the sys-
tem responds by employing “wired-and” 
arbitration (arbiter = logical AND operator) 
to resolve the resulting conflicts over bus 
access. The message with the highest pri-

ority (lowest binary value of the identifier) 
is assigned first access, without any data 
loss or delay (non-destructive protocol).
The arbitration principle permits the 
dominant bits transmitted by a given sta-
tion to overwrite the recessive bits of the 
other stations (Fig. 8). Each station outputs 
the identifier of its message onto the bus 
bit by bit, with the most significant bit first. 
During this arbitration phase, each station 
wishing to send data compares the level 
present on the bus with the level it actually 
possesses. Each station that attempts to 
send a recessive bit but encounters a dom-
inant bit loses the arbitration process. 
The station with the lowest identifier, i.e. 
the highest priority, makes its way onto  
the bus without having to repeat the mes-
sage (non-destructive access control).  
The transmitters of lower-priority mes-
sages automatically become recipients of 
the message just sent by another station. 
They repeat their attempt to send as soon 
as the bus is free again. 

Without this access control, bus colli-
sions would result in faults. To guarantee 
unequivocal bus arbitration, therefore,  
it is not permissible for more than one 
node to send a message with the same 
identifier.

With this access method, maximum-pri-
ority messages only have to wait for the 
transfer of the message currently being 
sent and, with bit times of 130 (CAN 2.0 A) 
or 150 (CAN 2.0 B), they have the lowest 
latency. At a data transfer rate of  
500 kBits/s, this equates to 260 µs or  
300 µs. The higher the load on the bus,  
the greater the data transfer’s temporal 
offset becomes for messages of lower pri-
ority, and thus the greater the uncertainty 
over when a message to be sent will arrive 
at the recipient.

In order that all messages have a chance 
of accessing the bus, the data transfer rate 
must be matched to the number of bus 
subscribers.

Priority assignments
The direct consequence of the arbitration 
process is that the identifier also has the 
role of prioritizing the frame during trans-
mission in addition to identifying the 
frame content. An identifier correspond-
ing to a low binary number has high prior-
ity and vice versa. Message priorities are 
derived from the speed at which the mes-
sage content changes or from the impor-
tance of the message to safety consider-
ations, for example. It must not be possible 
for messages to have the same priority.

Message format
The message transfer on the CAN bus is 
based on four different frame formats:
 ▶ Data frame: 

The transmitted message contains data 
(e.g. current engine speed) that is pro-
vided by the transmitting station (data 
source).

 ▶ Remote frame: 

Stations can request the data they  
need from the data source (example:  
the windshield wiper requests how wet 
the windshield is from the rain sensor). 
The data source responds by sending 
the relevant data frame.

 ▶ Error frame: 

If a station detects a fault or error, it 
communicates this to the other stations 
using an error frame.

 ▶ Overload frame:

This can be used to create a delay be-
tween a preceding and subsequent data 
frame or remote frame. The transmitting 
node reports that it cannot currently 
process another frame.

For data transfer on the data bus, a mes-
sage frame is created. It contains the infor-
mation to be transmitted arranged in a 
 defined sequence. CAN supports two dif-
ferent formats of frame, which are speci-
fied in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B. The most 
important difference between these two 
frame formats is the length of the identi-
fier. A CAN 2.0 A frame has an 11-bit iden-
tifier, while a CAN 2.0 B frame has a 29-bit 
identifier divided into two parts (11 bit 
and 18 bit).

Both formats are compatible with  
each other and can be used together in  
a network. The frames compliant with 
CAN 2.0 A and B are shown in Figure 9. 
They have a maximum length of 130 bits 
(standard format) or 150 bits (extended 
format).

Bus systems  |  CAN bus  |  99

In CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B data frames, 
the sequence of transferred information 
is arranged in the same way. The start-of-
frame bit is followed by the arbitration, 
control, data and CRC fields. A frame is 
completed by the ACK field and the end-
of-frame.

Start of frame
The bus is recessive in idle state. The start 
of frame, represented by a dominant bit, 
indicates the start of a transmission and, 
together with the process of bit stuffing, 
serves to synchronize all stations.

Arbitration field
With a CAN 2.0 A frame, the arbitration 
field comprises the 11-bit identifier and  
a control bit, the RTR bit (Remote Trans-
mission Request).

With a CAN 2.0 B frame, the arbitration 

field comprises the 11-bit identifier, fol-
lowed by the SRR bit (Substitute Remote 
 Request) and the IDE (Identifier Extension 
Bit). Both bits are sent recessively and 
thereby ensure that a CAN 2.0 A frame 
 always takes priority over a CAN 2.0 B 
frame if it has the same 11-bit identifier. 
The second 18-bit identifier follows. The 
RTR bit completes the arbitration field.

The RTR bit indicates whether the trans-

mitted frame is a data or remote frame. 
The RTR bit is dominant in the data frame 
and recessive in the remote frame. If sta-
tion A, for example, happens to send a 
message by data frame and station B re-
quests this message by remote frame at  
the same time, the arbitration conflict can-
not be resolved in this situation by means 
of the message identifier: the RTR bit is the 
decisive factor for access authorization. 
First of all, station A wins arbitration  
with the sending of the dominant RTR bit 
and continues to transmit the message.  
Station B, which has requested precisely 
this message, prepares to receive and  
is able to read the other data sent by 
 station A.

Control field
In a CAN 2.0 A frame, the control field 
comprises the IDE bit (Identifier Extension 
Bit), which is always sent as dominant 
here, followed by a reserved bit for future 
extensions, which is sent recessively. The 
remaining four bits in this field define the 
number of data bytes in the next data field. 
This enables the receiver to determine 
whether all data has been received.

The structure of a CAN 2.0 B frame is 
practically identical. However, since the 
IDE bit already belongs to the arbitration 
field, a further reserved bit for future ex-
tensions takes its place and this reserved 
bit is sent recessively.

Data field
The data field contains the actual mes- 
sage information comprised of between  
0 and 8 bytes. A data field in which the 
length of the data is expressed in 0 results 
in the shortest possible data frame with  
a length of 44 or 64 bits. A frame like this 
can be used to synchronize distributed 
processes. A number of signals can be 
transmitted in a single message (e.g. en-
gine temperature and engine speed).

CRC field
The CRC field (Cyclic Redundancy Check-
sum) contains a 15-bit checksum (frame 
check word) across the preceding frame 
from the start bit to the final bit of the data 
field. The 16th bit (CRC delimiter) in this 
field is recessive and closes the checksum.  
The checksum is a means of detecting 
 possible transmission interference.

ACK field
Unlike all preceding fields, the ACK field 
(acknowledgment) is not set by the sender 
of the frame but by a different node that is 
able to acknowledge receipt of the frame 
directly after the data field. This field 
 comprises the ACK slot and the recessive  
ACK delimiter. The ACK slot is also trans-
mitted recessively by the sender and over-

100  |  Bus systems  |  CAN bus

written as dominant by a receiver upon the 
message being correctly received. Here, it 
is  irrelevant whether the message is of any 
significance for the particular receiver in 
the sense of an acceptance check (message 
filtering). Only correct receipt is con-
firmed. This signals to the sender that no 
malfunction occurred during data transfer.

End of frame
The end of frame marks the end of the 
message and comprises seven recessive 
bits. With seven bits of the same value in 
succession, the stuffing rule is deliberately 
broken (see Error detection). 

Interframe space
The interframe space comprises a succes-
sion of three recessive bits which serve to 
separate successive messages. After a total 
of 10 of these recessive bits, the stations 
are permitted to begin transmitting within 
the network again. Until then, the bus re-
mains in idle state.

Only data and remote frames need to 
 include the interframe space. Error and 
overload frames can be sent immediately 
after the last frame. This enables immedi-
ate signaling of errors and problems.

Transmitter initiative
The transmitter will usually initiate a data 
transmission by sending a data frame. It is 
also possible for a receiving station to call 
in data from a sending station by deposit-
ing a remote frame. The network node  
that is able to deliver the information re-
quested makes the information available  
in response to this query.

Error detection
The bus line may suffer interference, e.g. 
electromagnetic interference. To eliminate 
the risk of faulty behavior, the transmitted 
data must be checked for correctness.  
A number of control mechanisms for 
 detecting errors are integrated in the  
CAN protocol.

Cyclic redundancy check
For every transmitted message, the trans-
mitter calculates a check sequence from 
the start-of-frame, arbitration, control and 
data field. A 15-bit checksum is derived 
from the bit sequence by means of a gener-
ator polynomial. The checksum is then 
used to detect errors in the data transfer.
With CRC generation, a defined genera-

tor polynomial is used to carry out poly-
nomial division across a given frame 
range. The remainder forms the checksum.
Once the CRC field has been received, 
the receiver is able to check that the frame 
has been transferred correctly by carrying 
out its own polynomial division of the re-
ceived frame range using the generator 
polynomial and checking whether the re-
ceived checksum matches the calculated 
remainder.

Frame check
The frame check involves all bus subscrib-
ers, senders as well as receivers, checking 
the sent/received data frame for compli-
ance with the predefined frame structure. 
The CAN protocol contains a number of 
fixed-format fields (start and end-of-
frame, delimiter) which are checked  
by all stations.

ACK check
With the ACK check, a receiver acknow-
ledges that the frame has been received 
correctly by sending a dominant bit in the 
ACK slot. The sender of the frame can then 
verify whether a message was transferred 
correctly. An absence of this bit indicates 
that a transmission error has been de-
tected.

Monitoring
The sender of a frame continuously moni-
tors the bus level. It is able to detect a 
transmission error by comparing the  
sent bit and the sampled bit.

Bus systems  |  CAN bus  |  101

Fault confinement in the event of failures
Defective stations could weigh heavily on 
bus traffic if they were to frequently send 
erroneous messages or interrupt the trans-
mission of correct messages by repeatedly 
sending an error frame. The CAN protocol 
localizes station failures by means of 
statististical error analysis. A station rec-
ognizes the probability of its own malfunc-
tion by how often it aborts messages be-
fore other stations send an error frame. 
The protocol’s first measure in this case  
is to prevent a station such as this from 
continuing to abort transmissions. In an 
emergency, the station shuts down auto-
matically.

Bit stuffing
Compliance with bit stuffing is checked by 
means of the code check. The stuffing con-
vention stipulates that in every data frame 
or remote frame a maximum of five suc-
cessive bits of equal state may be sent be-
tween the start of frame and the end of  
the CRC field. As soon as five identical bit 
states have been transmitted in succes-
sion, the sender includes a bit with the op-
posite state. The receiving station clears 
all of these inserted bits after the message 
has been received (destuffing). 

This measure permits detection of line 
faults, e.g. short-circuit or burst interfer-
ence. Rare signal changes would affect  
the possibility for synchronization in the 
nodes.

Error handling
If a CAN controller detects a fault or for-
mat error, it interrupts the current trans-
mission by sending an error frame com-
prising six successive dominant bits. This 
breaks the stuffing rule that prohibits this 
type of bit sequence. If the sender detects 
that its message has been interrupted by 
an error frame, it stops transmitting and 
makes another attempt at a later time.  
This effect prevents other stations from 
accepting the erroneous message and 
thereby ensures consistency of data  
across the entire system.

102  |  Bus systems  |  CAN bus

Hardware
CAN controller of a subscriber
The CAN controller of a subscriber gener-
ates a frame from the data to be sent con-
taining all the fields required for compli-
ance with the CAN protocol. It then con-
verts the frame into a bit stream.

CAN only specifies the physical, trans-
portation and object layers. The interfaces 
that are provided in the application layer 
can be arranged differently to suit the field 
of application. In order to provide proper 
CPU support (electronic control unit mi-
crocontroller for application software) for 
a wide range of different requirements, 
semiconductor manufacturers have 
brought onto the market products that 
provide a variety of capabilities. They dif-
fer neither in the frame format they pro-
duce, nor in their error-handling methods, 
but solely in the type of CPU support re-
quired for message administration.

If messages on the bus are managed in 
extended format (29-bit identifier), the 
CAN controllers must be compatible with 
the CAN 2.0 B specification. There are 
controllers that only support CAN 2.0 A 
and send and receive messages in the 
standard format, but that generate errors 
with messages in the extended format. 
Other controllers are able to tolerate the 
extended format without generating an 
 error. These modules can be used in a CAN 
together with controllers that administer 
the sending and receiving of messages in 
the extended format.

Basic CAN
In modules with basic-CAN implementa-
tion, only the basic function of the CAN 
protocol for the generation of the bit 
stream is implemented in the hardware. 
For the management of the messages to be 
sent and received, there is an intermediate

Modules without local computer
A further category of CAN module is one 
that is supplied without a local computer. 
These SLIOs (Serial Linked Input/Output) 
are able to input and output data via ports. 
They are therefore suitable for making 
sensors and actuators bus-compatible at 
low cost, but they do need a master that 
controls them.

Transceiver
The bit stream generated by the CAN con-
troller is made up of binary signals. They 
do not yet correspond to the required volt-
age levels of the CAN bus. The CAN-bus in-
terface module, or transceiver, generates 
the differential signals CAN_H and CAN_L 
and the reference voltage Uref from the 
 binary data stream.

Sleep mode
The CAN comfort bus must remain ready 
for operation even with the ignition 
switched off so that functions such as the 
radio, power windows or parking lamp 
may continue to operate. The bus sub-
scribers must therefore be supplied by 
 terminal 30 (permanent positive). After 
terminal 15 has been switched off (ignition 
off), a CAN node may enter sleep mode 
(standby) to relieve the vehicle electrical 
system of as much load as possible. The 
transmitter part of the transceiver module 
is switched off in this condition to mini-
mize the power consumption in this mode 
of operation. However, the receiver part 
remains active and checks whether mes-
sages are being sent on the bus. In this 
way, the CAN controller, which also enters 
standby mode, is able to react to a wake-up 
message and fully activate the CAN node.

buffer to which the local computer (appli-
cation software microcontroller) has ac-
cess (Fig. 10). Since the buffer capacity  
is limited, the computer must read the 
 received data before new messages are 
 received. Message filtering also takes 
place in this computer. A part of the 
 computer’s capacity is therefore used for 
CAN management. Since the computers  
do not usually have sufficient processing 
capacity, modules with basic CAN are pri-
marily suitable for low bit rates, or for the 
transmission of fewer messages but at 
higher bit rates.

The advantage of these modules, in com-

parison to modules with full CAN, is the 
smaller chip surface and the lower manu-
facturing costs.

Full CAN
Full CAN implementation is the protocol of 
preference in cases where a station has to 
manage several messages at high bit rates 
and the local computer has no free capac-
ity for communication tasks. They contain 
several “communication objects”, each of 
which contains the identifier and the data 
of a particular message. During the initial-
ization of the CAN module by the local 
computer, it is decided which messages 
the CAN controller should send and which 
received messages it should process fur-
ther. Received messages are only accepted 
(message filtering) if the identifier matches 
one of the communication objects. 

CAN controllers with full-CAN imple-
mentation relieve the burden on the local 
computer by performing all of the commu-
nication including message filtering in the 
controller (Fig. 11). 

The CAN controller can be coupled to 
the microcontroller in the electronic con-
trol unit as a stand-alone module by the 
address/data bus. Powerful microcon-
trollers have the CAN controller integrated 
on-chip. This type of bus coupling is the 
more cost-effective and thus the more 
common solution.

Data transfer sequence
Using the transfer of engine speed as an 
example, it shall be demonstrated how 
data is transferred on a CAN with full-CAN 
module.

Transmission
The engine management’s application soft-
ware calculates the engine speed from the 
signal from the engine-speed sensor. This 
value is calculated once for every combus-
tion cycle. The measured value enters both 
the receive buffer and the transmit buffer 
of the microcontroller (Fig. 12a).

The engine-management microcon-
troller is coupled to the CAN controller  
by a parallel interface. The contents of  
the transmit buffer are cyclically passed  
(e.g. every 10 ms) to the transmit buffer  
of the CAN controller. A flag notifies the 
CAN controller that a message is ready  
to be sent. With this transmit instruction, 
the engine management has completed its  
part of the task.

12 Data transfer sequence

Once the engine-speed information has 
been stored in the transmit buffer, the 
CAN controller begins to compile the CAN 
frame. Over the RxD line, the CAN con-
troller now monitors the bus. If the bus is 
free, it immediately starts to generate the 
bit stream and directs it to the transceiver 
on the TxD line; if the bus is occupied, it 
waits. From the bit stream, the transceiver 
creates a signal with the requisite voltage 
level.

Reception
The message originally sent by the engine 
management and forwarded on by the 
transceiver is received by all stations 
 connected to the bus (Fig. 12b). The mes-
sage reaches the CAN controller on the 
RxD lines in the form of a bit stream. 

At the first stage (monitoring layer),  
the CAN controller checks the incoming 
message for errors using the CRC check-
sum. If the message is free of errors, each

station responds with an acknowledge 
(ACK check).

At the second stage, or acceptance layer, 

the message undergoes message filtering. 
Each station checks whether the received 
identifier is addressed to the particular 
station and whether the message is re-
quired in the application software. If not, 
the message is rejected. Otherwise, it 
makes its way to the receive buffer. A flag 
notifies the application software that a 
new message is ready for processing. 

The instrument cluster, for example, 
calls up the available message, processes 
the engine-speed information and calcu-
lates triggering signals for the actuator of 
the rev counter.

Standardization
The International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO) and SAE (Society of Au-
tomotive Engineers) have issued CAN stan-
dards for data exchange in automotive ap-
plications: 
 ▶ For low-speed applications up to 

125 kBit/s: ISO 11 519-2 and 11 898-3
 ▶ For high-speed applications faster than 
125 kBit/s: ISO 11 898-2 and SAEJ 22 584 
(passenger cars) or SAEJ 1 939 (commer-
cial vehicles)

 ▶ An ISO Standard for diagnosis via CAN 
has also been published as ISO 15 765

Standardization makes it possible for 
 components of different manufacturers  
to function together. No adaptations are 
required.

CAN is also widely used in industrial auto-
mation. These applications are supported 
by an alliance of companies in the “CAN in 
Automation” users group (CiA). 

Bosch has concluded contracts with its 
licensees that guarantee that any CAN im-
plementations will be able to communicate 
with each other. Users will be able to rely 
on the interaction of any CAN modules.

Characteristics
 ▶ Standardized in accordance with  

ISO 11898

 ▶ Prioritized communication
 ▶ Data transfer rates: up to 1 MBits/s
 ▶ Data capacity: up to 8 bytes per message
 ▶ Real-time response: the data protocol is 
sufficient for the real-time requirements 
in the motor vehicle

 ▶ Non-destructive bus-access method
 ▶ Low power consumption
 ▶ Flexibility of configuration
 ▶ Simple and economical design with 

twisted line pairs

 ▶ Very high reliability of data transfer 
 ▶ Fault detection and signaling

 ▶ The number of nodes is theoretically un-
limited. However, a limit arises in prac-
tice from the capacitive load of the bus 
and the increasing latencies of messages 
when a high number need to be sent.

106  |  Bus systems  |  LIN bus

LIN bus

Overview
The increasing use of mechatronic systems 
in the motor vehicle gave rise to the idea  
of designing a cost-effective bus system  
as an alternative to the low-speed CAN.  
In 1998, several automotive manufacturers 
founded a consortium with the aim of de-
veloping a specification for a serial bus for 
the networking of sensors and actuators in 
the body electronics area.

It was believed that a bus system with 
simple bus protocol and a simple sequence 
control would make it possible to use even 
low-capability microcontrollers without 
additional hardware for the communica-
tion interface.

The workgroup’s resulting LIN bus 
 specification was introduced into mass 
production with the Mercedes-Benz SL  
as early as 2001. 

The name, LIN (Local Interconnect 
 Network), is derived from the fact that  
all electronic control units are located 
within a demarcated installation space  
(e.g. in the door). The LIN, therefore, is  
a local subsystem for supporting the vehi-
cle network by means of superordinate 
CAN networks.

1 LIN bus with master and slave nodes

The LIN bus is suitable for low data rates 
of up to 20 kBit/s and is typically limited to 
a maximum of 16 bus subscribers.

The electrical interface can be created 
easily and cost-effectively in the network 
nodes. As far as the nodes are concerned, 
a distinction is made between the master, 
which is generally an electronic control 
unit connected to a superordinate bus sys-
tem, and the slaves. These are intelligent 
actuators, intelligent sensors or, quite sim-
ply, just switches with additional hardware 
for the LIN-bus interface.

The bus subscribers are usually ar-
ranged in a linear bus topology and con-
nected to each other by a single-wire line. 
This topology, however, is not explicitly 
specified.

Communication on the LIN bus takes 

place in a time-synchronous manner, 
whereby the master defines the time grid. 
Consequently, there arises a strictly deter-
ministic LIN bus response.

Figure 1 shows an example of a LIN net-
work as a subbus in the roof/wiper area of 
the motor vehicle. Here, the bus comprises 
a central electronic control unit, as the 
master, and the four slaves: mirror, garage-
door opener, rain/light sensor and wiper 
actuator. The master also functions as a 
gateway to the Chassis CAN, the Body CAN 
and the Diagnostics CAN.

Applications
The LIN bus as a means of networking me-
chatronic systems can be used for many 
applications in the motor vehicle for which 
the bit rates and variability of the CAN bus 
are not essential. Examples of LIN applica-
tions: 
 ▶ Door module with door lock, power-win-
dow drive and door-mirror adjustment
 ▶ Control of the power-sunroof drive unit
 ▶ Control of the wiper motor for the wind-

shield wiper 

 ▶ Sensor for rain and light detection
 ▶ Air-conditioning system (transmission 
of signals from the control element, 
 activation of the fresh-air blower)

 ▶ Headlight electronics
 ▶ Control of motors for seat adjustment
 ▶ Theft deterrence
 ▶ Garage-door opener

Data transmission system
The LIN bus is designed as an unshielded 
single-wire line. The bus may adopt two 
logical states: 
 ▶ The dominant level corresponds to the 
electrical voltage of approx. 0 V and 
 represents logical 0

 ▶ The recessive level corresponds to 
 battery voltage UBat and represents 
the logical 1 state

The recessive level is characterized by a 
resistance to battery voltage of 1kV in the 
master and 30kV in the slaves.

Due to circuitry variations, there may be 

differences in the voltage levels. A stable 
data transfer is ensured by the defining of 
tolerances for sending and receiving in the 
areas of the recessive and dominant levels. 
The tolerance zones on the reception side 
are wider (Fig. 2) to make it possible for 
valid signals to be received despite inter-
ference radiation.

The data rate of the LIN bus is limited  
to a maximum of 20 kBit/s. This is the out-
come of a compromise between the de-
mand for high edge steepness for easy syn-
chronization of the slaves on the one hand, 
and the demand for lower edge steepness 
for improved EMC characteristics on the 
other. The standard bit rates of 2,400 Bit/s, 
9,600 Bit/s and 19,200 Bit/s are recom-
mended. The minimum permissible value 
for the bit rate is 1 kBit/s to prevent time-
out conflicts. The edge steepness itself  
is defined in the LIN specification as  
1 to 3 V/µs.

The maximum number of nodes is not 

specified in the LIN specification. It is 
 theoretically limited by the number of 
available identifiers. In practice, the num-
ber of subscribers is restricted to 16 due  
to the maximum permissible total capacity 
of the bus system.

108  |  Bus systems  |  LIN bus

Bus access
Access to the LIN bus is determined by the 
master-slave principle. Each message is 
initiated by the master. The slave has the 
possibility to respond. The messages are 
exchanged between the master and one, 
several or all of the slaves (point-to-point, 
multicast, broadcast).

The following relationships are possible 
in the communication between master and 
slave:
 ▶ Message with slave response: the master 
sends a message to one or more slaves 
and asks for data (e.g. switch states or 
measured values)

 ▶ Message with master instruction: the 

master gives a slave a control instruction 
(e.g. switch on a servomotor)

 ▶ The master initiates communication 

 between two slaves

No arbitration or conflict management is 
required because, with the master-slave 
access control, the master alone controls 
access to the data line.

LIN protocol
Frame
The information transferred on the  
LIN bus is embedded in a defined frame 
(Fig. 3). A message initiated by the master 
always begins with a header. The response 
(message field) contains different informa-
tion depending on the type of message.  
If the master wishes to transmit control 
 instructions for a slave, it will populate the 
response with data to be used by the slave. 
If the master is transmitting a data request, 
the slave that it is addressing will populate 
the response with the data requested by 
the master.

Header
The head is composed of the following 
parts:
 ▶ The synchronization break
 ▶ The synchronization field
 ▶ The identifier field

Synchronization
To guarantee consistent data transfer 
 between master and slaves, a synchroniza-
tion takes place at the beginning of each 
frame. First of all, the beginning of a  
frame is unambiguously marked by the 
synchronization break (SynchBreak).

The SynchBreak comprises at least 13 con-
secutive dominant levels and one recessive 
level.

At the end of the synchronization break, 
the master sends the synchronization field 
(SynchField) consisting of the bit sequence 
01010101. The slaves are then able to ad-
just themselves to the time basis of the 
master and thus synchronize.

The synchronization method described 
permits a loose specification of the timing 
of the bus subscribers. The clocking of  
the master should not deviate more than 
±0.5 % from the nominal value. The clock-
ing of the slaves is permitted to deviate by 
up to 15 % before synchronization as long 
as the synchronization reduces the devia-
tion to a maximum of 2 % before the end  
of the message.

In this way, the slaves can be built with-

out an expensive quartz oscillator, e.g. 
 using a simple RC circuit.

Identifier
The third byte in the header is used as the 
LIN identifier. As with the CAN bus, a con-
tent-based addressing method is used –  
the identifier therefore provides informa-
tion about the content of a message (e.g. 
engine speed). Based on this information, 
all nodes connected to the bus decide 
whether they would like to receive and 
process the message further or simply 
 ignore it. This process is known as accep-
tance filtering.

Six of the eight bits of the identifier field 

determine the identifier itself. Their per-
mutations give rise to a possible 64 differ-
ent identifiers (ID). They have the follow-
ing meanings:
 ▶ ID = 0 to 59: transmission of signals.
ID = 60: master request for the com-
mands and diagnosis

 ▶ ID = 61: slave response to ID 60
 ▶ ID = 62: reserved for manufacturer-

 specific communication

 ▶ ID = 63: reserved for future extensions 

to the protocol

Of the 64 possible messages, 32 may only 
contain two data bytes, 16 may only con-
tain four data bytes, and the remaining 16 
eight data bytes each.

The last bits in the identifier field con-

tain two checksums, which are used to 
check the identifier for transmission er-
rors and any resulting incorrect message 
assignments.

Data field
Once the header sent by the master node 
has been transmitted, it is time for the 
transfer of the actual data to begin. The 
slaves know from the transmitted identi-
fier whether or not they are being ad-
dressed and, if they are, they reply with 
their response in the data field.

Several signals can be packed into one 

frame. In this case, each signal has pre-
cisely one generator, i.e. it is always writ-
ten by the same node of the network. 

During the data transfer of the bytes,  
it is always the least significant bit (LSB) 
that is output first. Each byte (8 bits) is 
preceded by a start bit and followed by  
a stop bit, which means that each byte 
 involves the transmission of ten bits.  
The purpose of the start and stop bits is  
to resynchronize the nodes and thereby 
prevent transmission errors.

The data response of the slaves is veri-

fied by means of a checksum.

 

LIN description file 
The configuration of the LIN bus, in other 
words the specification of network sub-
scribers, signals and frames is managed  
in the LIN description file, or ldf. For this 
purpose, the LIN specification provides for 
an appropriate configuration language.

From the ldf, a set of C codes or header 
files is automatically generated using suit-
able tools. These are used as the basis for 
implementing the master and slave func-
tions in the electronic control units con-
nected to the bus.

110  |  Bus systems  |  LIN bus

The ldf is therefore a means of configuring 
the entire LIN network. It represents a 
common interface between the vehicle 
manufacturer and the supplier of the 
 master or slave modules.

Message scheduling
The scheduling table in the ldf defines the 
sequence and time grid in which messages 
are sent. Frequently needed information is 
sent more often. Once the table has been 
worked through, the master begins with 
the first message again. The sequence in 
which the table is worked through may 
change depending on the operating status 
(e.g. diagnostics active/inactive, ignition 
on/off).

The transfer grid of each message is 
therefore known. This deterministic be-
havior is guaranteed by the fact that, with 
the master-slave access control principle, 
all messages are initiated by the master. 

Network management
The nodes of an LIN network can be forced 
into sleep mode to minimize the no-load 
current of the entire electronics and elec-
trical system in the vehicle. Sleep mode 
can be achieved in two ways:
 ▶ The master sends the go-to-sleep com-
mand with the reserved identifier 60

 ▶ The slaves enter sleep mode of their own 

accord if no data transfer has taken 
place on the bus for a relatively long 
 period (4 seconds)

Both the master and the slaves are able to 
wake up the network. To do so, they must 
send the wake-up signal. This comprises 
data byte 128. After a break of 4 to 64 bit 
times (wake-up delimiter), all nodes must 
have been initialized and be ready to re-
spond to the master.

Example: air-conditioning control
The LIN bus is typically used in the control 
of the air-conditioning system. The operat-
ing and display unit functions as the bus 
master. This is where the software for the 
open and control algorithms are stored.

One of its tasks is to adjust the speed of 
the fresh-air blower. The controlled vari-
able for this is the actual temperature in 
the passenger cell and the desired temper-
ature set by the driver. The electronic con-
trol unit receives the interior temperature 
from a temperature sensor located in an 
appropriate place in the interior. The de-
sired temperature is set at the control unit, 
e.g. using a sensor ring.

From the input variables, the electronic 

control unit calculates that the blower 
speed needs to be increased to a value of 
200 rpm, for example. The electronic con-
trol unit transmits a message containing 
the master instruction to the LIN bus at a 
defined time interval. The identifier in this 
example would be “set the blower speed”. 
In this subbus, this instruction corre-
sponds to identifier 25, for example. 
 Following the header containing this iden-
tifier, the master transmits a numerical 
value in the data field that equates to the 
physical value of 200 rpm. Each slave pos-
sesses a list of identifiers that are relevant 
for this node. The fresh-air blower is the 
one and only slave that responds to the 
“set blower speed” identifier and executes 
the master’s request.

At speeds below idle, the fresh-air 
blower must be switched off. At this low 
speed, the heavy load could cause the en-
gine to stall. The LIN bus is coupled to the 
CAN bus via the gateway and thus receives 
the current engine speed on a continuous 
basis. If the speed falls below the specified 
engine-speed threshold, the LIN master 
sends the message containing the “set 
blower speed” identifier where the data 
field contains the value 0. The fresh-air 
blower switches off in response.

Intelligent actuators can send up-to-date 
operating-status information to the actuat-
ing unit. The fresh-air blower records the 
speed by means of a sensor and sends it 
back on the LIN bus as a numerical value. 
Due to the master-slave access method,  
the value is only contained in a message 
with slave response initiated by the mas-
ter. The feedback signal with the current 
engine speed makes it possible to control, 
and therefore accurately maintain, the 
 desired value.

MOST bus

Introduction
The MOST bus (Media Oriented Systems 
Transport) was specifically developed for 
the networking of infotainment systems in 
motor vehicles. In addition to traditional 
entertainment functions, such as radio 
tuners or CD players, these infotainment 
systems (which are becoming an increas-
ingly common feature of modern vehicles, 
and premium class vehicles in particular) 
also offer video functions (DVD and TV), 
route guidance capabilities and access to 
mobile communications and information. 

Requirements
The functions of an infotainment system 
place high demands on a bus system.  
The transmission of multimedia data,  
both audio and video, requires a high  
data rate and a synchronization of the  
data transfer between source and sink  
as well as between sinks themselves. 

For the transmission of informational 
data, e.g. detailed information about the 
music tracks on an mp3 player, and the 
sending of software updates, it is neces-
sary for the data transfer to be flexible 
with varying and, at certain times,  
equally very fast data rates. 

Likewise, the requirements for use in a 
motor vehicle, and the associated require-
ments of electromagnetic compatibility 
(EMC), must also be fulfilled.

MOST Cooperation
It was with these requirements in mind 
that the MOST bus was developed by the 
MOST Cooperation. This was founded in 
1998 by BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Harman/
Becker and Oasis SiliconSystems (now part 
of SMSC). By 2006, the MOST Cooperation 
had 16 automotive manufacturers and 
67 suppliers and tool makers among its 
membership. 

The MOST Cooperation creates and ad-
ministers the specifications on which the 
MOST bus is based. Furthermore, it de-
fines the requirements for implementation 
of MOST devices and provides appropriate 
compliance tests through accredited test 
houses.

Type of use
At present, the MOST bus is almost exclu-
sively used for the networking of infotain-
ment systems in motor vehicles. It can cur-
rently be found in over 35 vehicle models 
of various manufacturers, especially in  
the premium and mid-range classes (as at 
2006).

Features of the MOST bus
The MOST bus supports the logical net-
working of up to 64 devices, at which point 
constraints associated with the chipsets 
may be encountered. 

In its current version, the MOST bus 
 offers a data rate of 24.8 MBit/s (MOST 25). 
Versions with higher data rates of 50 MBit/s 
(MOST 50) and 150 MBit/s (MOST 150) are 
already available as a development model.

Data transmission channels
For the transmission of data, the MOST bus 
supports the following channels and their 
different attributes:
 ▶ The control channel is used for the sim-
ple transmission of control commands, 
for the signaling of device statuses and 
for the sending of messages necessary  
to system management. With MOST 25, 
the control channel has a gross band-
width of 705.6 kBit/s.

 ▶ For the transmission of multimedia data, 
the MOST bus has a flexible number  
of synchronous channels that are able  
to carry both audio and video data.  
In MOST 25, there are a maximum of  
15 audio channels available in stereo 
quality.

Bus systems  |  MOST bus  |  113

 ▶ On the asynchronous channel, data is 
sent in packets. It is therefore suitable 
for transferring information that does 
not require a fixed data rate but does 
need a high data rate at certain times. 
Examples could be the transfer of track 
information of an mp3 player or a soft-
ware update. With MOST 25, the asyn-
chronous channel has a gross bandwidth 
of up to 12.7 MBit/s.

The available bandwidth can be flexibly 
distributed between the asynchronous 
channel and the synchronous channels  
by means of the “boundary descriptor”, 
which can also be shifted to the transit 
 period if relevant preconditions are met. 

Topology
A MOST system is arranged in a ring struc-
ture whereby a device is connected to its 
predecessor or successor in the ring by  
an input or output respectively (Fig. 1). 
One of the devices acts as the “timing 
 master” and generates the data frames  
for data transfer with which the other 
 devices synchronize.

Each device has a bypass. When this is 
closed, the device forwards the signal 
 directly and is therefore invisible to the 
MOST system. This service is useful,  
for example, when the system is starting 
and a device requires more time for initial-
ization, or in the event of a temperature-
 dependent shutoff.

There are also other possible structures 

for a MOST system, e.g. a star topology. 
 Internally, however, these must always  
be arranged to form a (logical) ring.  
With a star structure, this can be achieved 
through use of a central hub, for example.

Device model
The MOST standard defines the model 
shown in Figure 2 for a MOST device for 
which the following elements are required: 

At the lowermost level, the physical 
layer provides access to the transmission 
agent. Departing from the original defini-
tion that provided for optical transmission 
by POF cable (Plastic Optical Fiber), there 
are today various physical layers available 
with optical and electrical transmission as 
well as various speeds of transfer.

The MOST network interface controller 
(NIC) is a hardware controller that is re-
sponsible for controlling the physical layer 
and implements the basic transfer ser-
vices. While in the original version of the 
NIC many control tasks had to be carried 
out by the main processor of the device, 
the current version (Intelligent Network 
Interface Controller, INIC) is, for the most 
part, able to handle tasks autonomously 
and already implements substantial parts 
of the network service. Typical controllers 
for the MOST are the OS8104 (NIC) and the 
OS81050 (INIC), manufactured by SMSC.

The MOST network service is the driver 

layer through which applications and 
 system services have access to the NIC. 
The lower layer of the network service 
(layer 1) offers basic communication and 
management functions, while the layer 
above (layer 2) offers functions for sup-
porting the development of applications, 
such as a translator for the application 
protocol or support for the notification 
service.

The applications of the device are imple-

mented on top of the network service.  
In a MOST system, the interface of an ap-
plication is realized as a function block 
(FBlock). Each device must at least imple-
ment a special FBlock, the NetBlock,  
which is required for management func-
tions within the MOST system. In addition, 
a device will usually implement one or 
more applications that can be used as 
FBlocks of applications on other devices.  
A device of a vehicle infotainment system 
is often integrated with several functions, 
e.g. those of a radio tuner and those of an 
amplifier, which can be represented in the 
MOST system as independent FBlocks.

Transmission agent
The MOST bus was originally defined as  
an optical transmission agent that used a 
plastic optical fiber (POF). The optical sig-
nal used here with a wavelength of 650 nm 
(in the red wavelength range) is generated 
by an LED on the transmit side, which is 
designated Tx-FOT (FOT = Fiber Optic 
Transceiver). On the receive side, Rx-FOT, 
the optical signal is converted back into an 
electrical signal by a PIN photodiode.

The POF cables used for automotive 
 applications (Fig. 3) consist of a 980 μm 
thick optical core insulated by 20 μm thick 
optical cladding with a low refractive in-
dex. In total, the optical conductor there-
fore has a diameter of 1 mm. The optical 
 fiber is insulated with a black buffer, which 
is in turn surrounded by a protective cable 
sheathing. This gives the cable a total dia-
meter of 2.3 mm.

POF lines offer the following benefits 

when used in the motor vehicle: 
 ▶ No electromagnetic interference radia-

tion

 ▶ Insensitivity to interference irradiation
 ▶ Lower weight than equivalent shielded 

electrical lines

 ▶ More flexible routing in comparison to 
equivalent shielded electrical lines

To date, modern vehicles are equipped 
 exclusively with MOST 25, with POF data 
transmission via POF connections. In addi-
tion to this, however, further transmission 
techniques have been defined for the 
MOST:
 ▶ The optical transmission by glass fiber 
cable (PCS) with laser diodes (VCSEL), 
which offers a greater damping reserve, 
supports higher speeds and is less sensi-
tive to high temperatures. 

 ▶ An electrical transmission by copper 
 cable, which is also less sensitive to 
 temperature and is more economical by 
comparison, requires additional shield-
ing measures at higher bandwidths.  
This has consequences for costs and 
 cabling.

Data transfer
Data transfer on the MOST bus is orga-
nized into data frames, which are gener-
ated by the timing master with a fixed data 
rate and passed on by subsequent devices 
in the ring.

Data frames
The timing master normally generates  
data frames with a cycle of 44.1 kHz,  
and in rarer cases 48 kHz. The cycle is 
 defined by the system manufacturer  
(i.e. the vehicle manufacturer in conjunc-
tion with its device suppliers) to suit the 
predominant media formats in the system. 
The size of the data frames, by extension, 
determines the bus speed of a MOST sys-
tem. With MOST 25, the size of a data 
frame is 512 bits. 

A data frame is made up of the following 

ranges (Fig. 4):
 ▶ Areas for administrative information  
at the start and end of the data frame, 
the tasks of which include the synchro-
nization of the data transfer, determina-
tion of the devices’ ring positions and 
the transmission of the boundary 
 descriptor

 ▶ An area for the control channel (with 
MOST 25, two bytes per data frame)
 ▶ An area for the synchronous channels, 
whereby one or more bytes are always 
assigned to a specific synchronous 
 channel

 ▶ An area for the asynchronous channel 

In the case of MOST 25, the synchronous 
and asynchronous area demand a 60-byte 
share of the data frame. The distribution 
between the synchronous channels and 
the asynchronous channel is determined 
by the value of the boundary descriptor 
with a resolution of 4 bytes. The synchro-
nous area must have at least 24 bytes  
(6 stereo channels). This means that  
24 to 60 bytes are permitted for the 
 synchronous area and 0 to 36 bytes are 
permitted for the asynchronous area.

System events
The fundamental system events described 
below indicate the current status of the 
data transfer in the MOST system. These 
are monitored by the NIC and forwarded 
by the network service to the applications, 
which must then respond accordingly.
 ▶ Lock, stable lock: a lock occurs as soon 
as communication is established in the 
ring, i.e. the correct device receives the 
correct data frames. A stable lock is set 
when the system has been in lock status 
for a specific period.

 ▶ Unlock, critical unlock: an unlock de-
notes the loss of the lock, i.e. that no 
 correct data frames are being received. 
If the system is in the unlock state for  
a certain period, the status switches to 
critical unlock.

 ▶ Network change event: if the number of 
devices in a MOST system changes be-
cause one device has opened or closed 
its bypass, this is signaled by a network 
change event. 

Addressing
Devices on the MOST bus are addressed by 
means of a 16-bit address. The following 
different addressing types are supported:
 ▶ Logical addresses: each device has a log-
ical address that is unique in the system 
and is set and distributed when the sys-
tem starts. The logical addresses can  
be set dynamically based on the ring 
 position, for which, beginning with the 
timing master, the hexadecimal range 
0x100 to 0x13F is reserved. Or they  
can be defined statically by the system 
manufacturer in a range reserved spe-
cifically for this purpose.

 ▶ Physical addresses: for system adminis-
tration services, e.g. determination of 
logical addresses, each device also has a 
physical address that is derived from its 
current ring position. The physical ad-
dresses are assigned the range 0x400 to 
0x43F. 

 ▶ Group addresses: each device may also 

be assigned a group address in the 
0x300 to 0x3FF range, making it possi-
ble to address all devices in a given 
group at the same time.

 ▶ Broadcast address: the MOST addition-
ally supports a special broadcast ad-
dress, hexadecimal 0x3C8, which makes 
it possible to address all devices in the 
MOST system.

Transmission of control commands
The control channel permits the transmis-
sion of control messages with a maximum 
length of 32 bytes. These have to be shared 
among consecutive data frames. With 
MOST 25, the 16 data frames required  
here are also known as a block. The format 
of the control messages is defined by the 
protocol described in the next section.

The sending of messages on the control 

channel is supported by the NIC. It pro-
vides the necessary services for data pro-
tection and channel arbitration, i.e. for de-
termining the next opportunity for a mes-
sage to be sent. The reliable transmission 
of control messages is safeguarded by the 
use of a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) and 
an automatic repeat request.

The control channel’s gross bandwidth 
of 705.6 kBit/s is reduced to a net data rate 
of 406 kBit/s following the deduction of ap-
proximately 3 % for system administration 
overheads (two of 64 control messages) 
and less the extra overhead to account  
for arbitration and data protection. Since 
arbitration only allows a particular device 
to populate every third available control 
message, an individual device has a maxi-
mum data rate of 135 kBit/s at its disposal 
for sending.

To enable the sending of messages of 
more than 32 bytes, the network service 
supports the segmentation and deseg-
mentation of application messages up to 
65,556 bytes in size on the control chan-
nel. This service, also known as the appli-

Bus systems  |  MOST bus  |  117

cation message service (AMS), differs from 
the control message service (CMS), which 
only allows 32-byte control messages to  
be sent.

Transmission of multimedia data
In the MOST system, the transmission of 
multimedia data takes place on the syn-
chronous channels. The data transfer is 
controlled by relevant control commands 
on the control channel. A synchronous 
channel can be assigned a specific band-
width, which is achieved with a resolution 
of one byte of a data frame. A stereo audio 
channel with a resolution of 16 bits re-
quires four bytes, for example. In the  
case of MOST 25, a maximum of 60 bytes 
(depending on the value of the boundary 
descriptor) are available for the synchro-
nous channels, which equates to 15 stereo 
audio channels.

The sinks and sources for multimedia 
data are each assigned to an FBlock, which 
provides the necessary functions for their 
management. An FBlock may therefore 
contain several sources and sinks, which 
are numbered consecutively with a source 
and sink number respectively. 

An FBlock has functions that supply in-
formation about the quantity and type of 
sources and sinks that it makes available 
(SyncDataInfo, SourceInfo and SinkInfo). 
Furthermore, each FBlock with a source 
has an “Allocate” function with which it 
 requests a synchronous channel and asso-
ciates its source to it. Its “Deallocate” 
 function, on the other hand, is used to  
free up the channel again. 

Similarly, an FBlock with a sink has a 
 “Connect” function for connecting the sink 
to a particular synchronous channel, and 
a “DisConnect” function for its disconnec-
tion. Several sinks may also be connected 
to a particular channel at the same time. 

With MOST 25, the channel assignment 

for synchronous channels is managed  
by the timing master. A source wishing  

to  occupy a synchronous channel  
sends an appropriate system message 
 request (ResourceAllocate) to the tim- 
ing master. A corresponding message 
 (ResourceDeallocate) is used to free the 
channel.

Transmission of packet data
On the asynchronous channel, data is sent 
in the form of packets. The asynchronous 
channel currently supports two modes:  
a slower 48-byte mode, where 48 bytes  
are available in each packet for the net 
data transfer but which places less heavy 
demands on device implementation, and  
a 1,014-byte mode that is more complex  
to implement.  

With MOST 25, between 0 and a maxi-
mum of 36 bytes of a data frame can be 
 assigned to the asynchronous channel, 
which corresponds to a maximum gross 
bandwidth of 12.7 MBit/s. For the 1,014-
byte mode, this produces a maximum net 
bandwidth of almost 11 MBit/s, and a data 
rate of almost 3 MBit/s for the 48-byte 
mode. In practice, however, substantially 
lower data rates are achieved mainly due 
to restrictions in device implementations.
The transmission of data packets on the 
asynchronous channel is also directly sup-
ported by the NIC. Likewise, a packet on 
the asynchronous channel contains a CRC 
to permit detection of simple transmission 
errors. Unlike the control channel, how-
ever, there is no issuing of automatic re-
peat requests on the data link layer.

To ensure reliable transfer and flow con-
trol in the large data volumes typical of the 
asynchronous channel, it is conventional 
to use yet another transport protocol that 
is implemented in a higher driver layer. 
This may either be the MOST high protocol 
(MHP), developed specifically for the 
MOST, or the popular TCP/IP protocol, 
which is set up on an appropriate adapta-
tion layer known as the MOST asynchro-
nous medium access control (MAMAC).

118  |  Bus systems  |  MOST bus

Administrative functions
The MOST standard defines the following 
administrative services that are required 
for the operation of a MOST system.

Configuration status
A valid configuration status in the MOST 
system is the prerequisite for communica-
tion in the application layer. The configu-
ration of the MOST system is managed by  
a single device, the network master. An ap-
plicative communication is only permitted 
once this device has signaled a conflict-
free configuration status.
 ▶ OK configuration status: the network 

master transmits the OK configuration 
status as soon as a conflict-free configu-
ration is achieved.

 ▶ NotOK configuration status: if a conflict 
arises, e.g. because two devices have  
the same address, the network master 
transmits its NotOK configuration status. 
In response to this, all devices initialize 
their addresses and communication set-
tings.

 ▶ New and Invalid configuration statuses: 
these configuration statuses indicate 
that a new application (FBlock) has  
been registered in the system or that a 
previously registered application has 
dropped out.

NetBlock
It is mandatory for each device to imple-
ment an FBlock called the NetBlock, which 
covers a range of different administrative 
functions (e.g. for address initialization) 
and supplies information about the device 
and the FBlocks that it implements.

Network master
The network master is implemented by  
a special device in a MOST system and  
is responsible for system configuration.  
In present-day systems, the network mas-
ter is usually realized by the headunit  
(i.e. the control element) of the infotain-
ment system. This device often assumes 
the role of timing master too, but this does 

not necessarily have to be the case. The 
other devices in the MOST system in this 
relationship are known as network slaves.
The network master manages an image 

of the current configuration of a MOST 
system in the central registry. In addition 
to the addresses of all devices, this also 
contains all FBlocks implemented by them 
(down to the system FBlocks such as the 
NetBlock). A network slave searching for 
the device address for a particular FBlock 
may request it from the network master. 
If a network slave frequently accesses 
other devices, it may, for faster access, also 
store a local copy of the central registry –  
a decentral registry – which it must update 
accordingly in the event of any change in 
the configuration.

To build the central registry, the net-
work master carries out a network scan 
when the system starts and as soon as  
a network change event has occurred. 
 During this scan, it queries the NetBlocks 
of all devices for the FBlocks implemented  
by this device. If it detects a conflict while 
doing so, e.g. duplicate device address or 
duplicate instance of an FBlock, it takes 
measures to resolve the conflict. To do 
this, the network master may initiate a 
 recalculation of addresses, convert the  
InstId of an FBlock or, if necessary,  
ignore a device. 

Connection master
The connection master manages the syn-
chronous connections existent in the MOST 
system at a given time. It makes available  
a table containing information about all  
the connections currently present in the 
MOST system (SyncConnectionTable).  
It also makes it possible to query the band-
width remaining for further synchronous 
connections (AvailableChannels).

On request, the connection master 
builds connections between a specific 
source and sink (BuildSyncConnection) or 
removes them (RemoveSyncConnection) 
by sending the necessary commands to  
the associated FBlocks. 

Bus systems  |  MOST bus  |  119

Table 1

It is even possible to dispense with the 
connection master completely if a central 
entity in a MOST system, e.g. the headunit, 
is responsible for the administration of the 
synchronous channels.

MOST application layer
The MOST standard defines a suitable pro-
tocol in the application layer for the trans-
mission of control commands, status infor-
mation and events. This protocol makes it 
possible to address a specific function of 
an application interface (i.e. of an FBlock) 
that is provided by any device within the 
MOST system. For example, it is possible 
to start playback of a CD on a separate  
CD player or to query the number of the 
track currently playing in it. While the 
MOST protocol is mainly applied to the 
control channel, it can be transferred 
across the asynchronous channel if 
 necessary.

Overview
The protocol for MOST control messages 
provides for the following elements of a 
control message (Table 1):
 ▶ The address of a device in the MOST sys-

tem (DeviceID)

 ▶ An identifier for an FBlock implemented 

by this device (FBlockID) and its in-
stance in the MOST system (InstID)

 ▶ The identifier for the requested function 

within the FBlock (FktID)

 ▶ The type of operation (OpType) that 

should be applied to this function, e.g. 
the setting or querying of a property of 
the FBlock

 ▶ A data range containing the parameters 
of the function call (Data) and a corre-
sponding length value (Length)

Function block (FBlock)
A function block (FBlock) defines the in-
terface of a specific application or system 
service. An FBlock is assigned an address 
comprising an 8-bit FBlockID, which spec-
ifies the type of FBlock, and an additional 
8-bit InstID. The latter is a means of distin-
guishing between several instances of 
FBlocks of the same type in a MOST sys-
tem. 

An FBlock that is controlled by an asso-
ciated application, and the device that im-
plements the FBlock, are known as the 
slave in this relationship (e.g. an applica-
tion that addresses an external CD player 
through the associated FBlock). The appli-
cation that controls the FBlock is called 
the controller.

The functions that an FBlock possesses 
are defined by the function catalog. In the 
case of system services, the function cata-
logs are defined by the MOST standard. 
The MOST standard even defines the inter-
faces for common applications from the 
area of vehicle infotainment systems (e.g. 
for an amplifier or a CD player/changer). 
However, these interfaces tend to be ex-
tended by the system manufacturer. Other 
proprietary FBlocks are defined in their 
entirety by the system or device manufac-
turer.

120  |  Bus systems  |  MOST bus

Functions and operations
A function block is made up of several 
functions that are addressed with a 12-bit 
FktID. Depending on the type of function, 
the function may be assigned differently 
predefined operations, which are de-
scribed by a 4-bit OpType identifier. In the 
case of functions, a further distinction is 
made between methods and properties.
A method describes an action that an 
FBlock is able to execute, e.g. starting the 
station scan of a radio tuner. A method  
can be initiated by the controller using a 
Start or StartResult operation. In response, 
the slave returns a corresponding result 
message if applicable (for StartResult).  
If this result is not made available within  
a specific period, the controller is notified 
that the method is still being processed by 
means of a processing message. In the end, 
a method may even be terminated by the 
sending of an abort message.

A property describes a particular attri-
bute of the FBlock, such as the number of 
the track currently playing. A property 
such as this can be requested (Get opera-
tions) or set (Set or SetGet operations)  
by the controller. As the result of such a 
query, the slave responds with a status 
message, if applicable (for Get and SetGet), 
containing the current contents of the 
property.

Furthermore, the MOST standard pro-
vides for a notification service with which 
a controller may register with a slave for 
certain properties. If the value of one of 
these properties changes, all controllers 
that have registered for notification are in-
formed of the change by a status message.

Data field
The data field of the control message con-
tains the parameter values for a function 
call or its results. The data field is inter-
preted as specified in the definition of the 
function concerned and may contain one 
or more parameter values.

The MOST standard defines the following 
parameter types:
 ▶ Boolean and BitField for individual 

 boolean values (1 byte) or sequence  
of individual bits (1, 2 and 4 bytes).

 ▶ Enum for enumerations. 
 ▶ Unsigned and signed byte, word and 

long for integer values with or without 
sign and a size of 1, 2 or 4 bytes.
 ▶ String for character strings. These  
are zero terminated and contain a 
 description of the character coding  
in the first byte.

 ▶ Stream, ClassifiedStream and 

 ShortStream for various types of  
byte sequences of any length.

A parameter type for real numbers does 
not exist. The MOST standard provides for 
real numbers represented as fixed-point 
values by the integer parameter types. 
More complex data types are not defined 
in the standard either. These have to be 
 realized by function classes instead.

Function classes
To standardize the way in which functions 
are defined, the MOST standard specifies  
a series of function classes for properties. 
These determine which properties the 
function has and which operations are 
permissible. 

In addition to simple function classes 

(with a single parameter for numerical 
 values or texts), there also exist complex, 
composite function classes. These are used 
to represent composite data structures 
such as records and arrays. They can also 
be nested at a specific nesting depth, 
which makes it possible to create two-
dimensional arrays or arrays of records, 
for example. These nested data structures 
are, for example, used to represent the 
phone book of a mobile phone. 

Bus systems  |  MOST bus  |  121

With multidimensional function classes, 
the two parameters PosX and PosY are 
used to address a particular position in the 
first or second dimension, where 0 always 
stands for all elements of this dimension. 
This makes it possible to access not only  
a specific element but also an entire line  
of a two dimensional array.

Applications
As well as defining the lower layers neces-
sary for data transfer, the MOST standard 
defines the interfaces for typical applica-
tions from the area of vehicle infotainment 
systems, e.g. a CD changer, amplifier or 
 radio tuner.

The FBlocks defined by the MOST Coop-
eration are compiled in a function catalog. 
The function catalog defines in detail all 
functions for the FBlocks contained in 
them as well as the permissible operations 
and their parameters.

For the function catalog, there is a ma-
chine-readable description available in 
XML format that can be used to import the 
catalog into various MOST tools.

In addition to the function catalog’s 
 description of all functions of an FBlock, 
developments are underway to specify the 
dynamic behavior for the use of an FBlock. 
This involves the use of message sequence 
charts (MSCs) compliant with the 
MSC 2000 standard but with minor,  
MOST-specific enhancements. 

Functions required by various applica-
tions, e.g. the aforementioned functions 
for managing sources for multimedia data, 
are defined in the GeneralFBlock. This is 
used as a function compilation, i.e. when a 
new FBlock is defined, all necessary func-
tions are copied from the GeneralFBlock to 
the new FBlock.

Bluetooth

Overview
Mobile communication is gaining ever 
more importance in all domains. For con-
venient communication between various 
devices, a wireless link is indispensable. 
Infrared connections, as often used in 
the past, tended to be manufacturer-
 specific, they required a direct line of 
sight and  imposed constraints on the 
area of movement. Only with a standard-
ized, wireless link could mobile devices 
of  different manufacturers communicate 
with each other without problems.

The development of the Bluetooth 
standard began in 1994 at the telecom-
munications company, Ericsson. As part 
of an initial study, Ericsson investigated 
the possibilities for completely replacing 
the cable connections between the cell 
phone and additional devices. In cooper-
ation with other industry partners, the 
Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) 
was formed in 1998 to create a uniform, 
internationally-accepted standard. The 
SIG set itself the aim of specifying a wire-
less technology with low manufacturing 
costs, low energy consumption and ro-
bust resistance to interference. The 
 wireless interface had to be suitable  

for transmitting data for multimedia 
 applications.

In the meantime, the Bluetooth SIG has 

expanded to involve around 2,000 com-
panies from the telecommunications, data 
processing and automotive engineering 
fields.

Applications
Bluetooth is an industry standard for  
the networking of mobile multimedia 
 devices, such as a car sound system, cell 
phone, headset, PDA (Personal Digital 
Assistant), PC and peripheral equipment 
(Fig. 1). Bluetooth stands for the simple 
exchange of data between portable ter-
minals and the wireless transmission of 
audio and video signals for entertain-
ment and information.

The short-range wireless connectivity 
of Bluetooth eliminates the need for con-
nection cables between the cell phone 
and the hands-free system: no more 
 tangling of cables when making a call.  
It is in this area that Bluetooth has been 
the most well received.

Meanwhile, a large number of con-
sumer electronics devices, be they cell 
phones, PDAs, notebooks or car phones, 
now offer an address book function.

With Bluetooth, it is possible to conve-
niently synchronize the entries stored  
in the various address books. The car 
driver is spared the laborious task of 
typing the phone number stored in the 
cell phone or PDA or inputting an ad-
dress into the navigation system. 

Bluetooth also makes it possible to 
 listen to the radio through a headset in 
the rear of the vehicle and to control  
the car sound system using a PDA.

Bluetooth is predominantly used for  
the transfer of data in the multimedia 
 domain. However, this technology can 
quite easily be used for diagnostic and 
service purposes. Workshops or break-
down services would be able to conve-
niently read vehicle information during 
fault diagnosis and record the condition 
of the vehicle.

Bluetooth versions
The first specification (Bluetooth 1.0) of 
the Bluetooth standard was adopted in 
July 1999. In December 1999 this specifi-
cation was replaced by Bluetooth 1.0b, 
which contained improvements and clar-
ifications for interoperability. February 
2001 saw the release of the Bluetooth 1.1 
specification, which fixed fundamental 
 interoperability problems between the 
first devices and chips and is used in 
most Bluetooth devices today. Three 
years later, in November 2003, version 
1.2 of the specification was published. 
This used the IEEE (Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers) language def-
inition for technical documentation and 
introduced adaptive frequency hopping 
(AFH) as a technical advancement that 
improves resistance to interference in 
the frequency band. The most significant 
modification was introduced with ver-
sion 2.0 of the specification in November 
2004. With the enhanced data rate (EDR), 
it was possible to triple the bit rate from 
1 MBit/s to 3 MBit/s and reduce power 
consumption. With each new version of 

the specification, great emphasis was 
placed on backward compatibility with

Transmission technology
Frequency band
Bluetooth operates in the worldwide-
 license-free 2.4 GHz ISM band (Industrial 
Scientific Medicine). This is available 
 practically worldwide without approval  
– apart from certain national limitations – 
and is reserved for applications in indus-
try, science and medicine. For this rea-
son, the possibility of interference from 
garage-door openers, microwave ovens 
or other appliances which operate using 
the same frequency band has to be ac-
cepted. To minimize interference, the 
best possible use should be made of the 
frequency spectrum. Devices that use  
the ISM band therefore implement 
spread-spectrum techniques.

Frequency-hopping method
Bluetooth divides the 2.4 GHz band  
into 79 channels at intervals of 1 MHz 
(f = 2,402 + k, k = 0…78). The band is 
 terminated at both the upper and lower 
end by two guard bands with a width of 
3.5 MHz (upper guard band) and 2 MHz 
(lower guard band). The transmission

8 differential phase-shift keying (8DPSK), 
which modulate the phase of the carrier. 
p/4DQPSK represents one of four com-
binations of a bit pair (00, 01, 10 and 11) 
and so transfers a maximum of two bits; 
8DPSK can represent any combination  
of three bits. This is used to increase the 
bit rate from 1 MBit/s (net 727 kBit/s) to 
2 MBit/s (net 1,446 kBit/s) with GFSK,  
or 3 MBit/s (net 2,169 kBit/s) with EDR.

Power classes
Bluetooth devices are categorized into 
different power classes. Manufacturers 
are free to decide which power class they 
implement. The present specifications 
 define three power classes:
 ▶ Class 1 with 100 mW (20 dBm) trans-
mission output for a range of 100 to 
150 m

 ▶ Class 2 with 2.5 mW (4 dBm) transmis-
sion output for a range of 10 to 25 m
 ▶ Class 3 with 1 mW (0 dBm) transmis-

sion output for a range of 10 m

Topology
Bluetooth supports the automatic config-
uration of ad-hoc networks. This means 
that two or more devices are able to 
spontaneously form a network with no 
prior knowledge of each other. Bluetooth 
is based on the master-slave principle.  
In principle, any Bluetooth device may  
be a master or a slave. The master is a 
special device that coordinates commu-
nication between the devices.

uses a combined frequency-hopping/ 
time division duplex (FH/TDD) method: 
the frequency-hopping spread spectrum 
(FHSS, Fig. 2). The channels are switched 
1,600 times per second (i.e. in 625 µs 
slots). The slots are assigned in accor-
dance with the TDD method, i.e. the 
transmitter and receiver are authorized 
to send alternately. The frequency-hop-
ping method guarantees optimal and 
 uniform use of the ISM band and makes 
Bluetooth resistant to interference from 
other transmitters in the same frequency 
band (e.g. WLAN). In addition, it also 
 offers some security because a hacker 
would not know the destination of a fre-
quency switch or indeed the time frame 
for which a particular frequency would 
be valid. This makes interception of a 
connection much more difficult. 

The introduction of adaptive fre-

quency hopping (AFH) in the Bluetooth 
1.2 specification further increased 
 Bluetooth’s resistance to interference 
and reduced the effect of Bluetooth itself 
as a source of interference on other de-
vices in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The num-
ber of effective channels is dynamically 
adaptable to the conditions in the fre-
quency band. Frequencies used by other 
transmitters are then removed from the 
list of 79 possible  channels.

Modulation method
Bluetooth uses the Gaussian frequency-
shift keying (GFSK) method of modula-
tion. This is a special variant of fre-
quency-shift keying (FSK) supplemented 
with a Gaussian low-pass filter. GFSK 
 varies the frequency and delivers 1 bit 
per keying interval. Bluetooth has a sym-
bol rate of 1 MBit/s. With the enhanced 
data rate (EDR) introduced with the 
 Bluetooth 2.0 specification, it has been 
possible to increase this data rate to 
3 MBit/s. This is made possible by the  
use of two variants of phase-shift keying 
(PSK): the p/4 differential quaternary 
phase-shift keying (p/4DQPSK) and the 

Bus systems  |  Bluetooth  |  125

Piconet
A network of Bluetooth devices is known 
as a piconet (Fig. 3). For the devices 
within a piconet, there are two roles: 
 master or slave. Which device assumes 
which role is not decided until communi-
cation is established. A device sets up a 
piconet and transmits its device ID and 
the value of its internal clock. This de-
vice becomes the master.

Any device that is not participating in  
a piconet but is not switched off remains 
in standby, which is marked by a small 
current draw.

The first stage in the creation of a 
piconet involves the potential master 
searching for other devices in its range 
(inquiry scan). Special frequency-hop-
ping sequences  (inquiry sequences) are 
available for this purpose. Devices that 
wish to enter into communication with 
other devices respond with an inquiry 
response message. By the end of the in-
quiry sequence, the information about all 
devices willing to communicate is avail-
able. The potential master is now able to 
address a specific device by means of a 
special paging sequence. Paging is a pro-
cess whereby a fixed connection is es-
tablished between a master and a slave. 
The slave contains all the information it 
needs to synchronize with the master.

The piconet is defined by the frequency-
hopping sequence, i.e. the sequence of 
switching between the 79 possible chan-
nels. The hopping sequence is specified  
by the master and is calculated from the 
master’s device ID (a worldwide unique 
48-bit identifier) and its internal clock. 
The slaves synchronize with the master’s 
clock and its hopping sequence. 

A master is able to manage up to seven 
active slaves. Each active slave receives  
a 3-bit active member address (AMA). 
Active devices can send data or even 
simply remain connected. By deregister-
ing, a device can switch back to standby.  
A Bluetooth device may also switch to 
any of three energy saving modes: hold 
mode, sniff mode and park mode. The 
devices continue to be synchronized with 
the hopping sequence of the piconet. The 
lowest energy saving mode is the park 
mode, where the device relinquishes its 
AMA and receives in its place an 8-bit 
parked member address (PMA). With the 
PMA, the device is still a subscriber in  
the piconet but makes way for another, 
active device. Parked devices remain 
synchronized with the hopping sequence 
of the  piconet and can be addressed and 
reactivated by the master using the PMA.

Scatternet
In a piconet, only one slave is ever able  
to communicate with the master simulta-
neously. When more slaves enter the net-
work, the data rate per device falls very 
quickly. This is where scatternets pro-
vide a solution. A scatternet consists of 
up to ten piconets in which the individ-
ual piconets partly overlap. In this way, it 
is possible to set up even larger networks  
in which all network subscribers may 
connect to one another. The scatternet  
in Figure 4 comprises two piconets. One 
of the Bluetooth devices is a member of 
both piconets. Through this device, the 
two networks are able to exchange data. 
However, this device, which is assigned

to more than one piconet, can only func-
tion as master in one of these networks.
A device that is assigned to two picon-
ets in a scatternet must synchronize with 
the network with which it wishes to com-
municate. It cannot remain connected to 
both networks at the same time. Before 
the device leaves the old piconet, it must 
inform its master that it will be unavail-
able for a certain period of time. The 
 remaining network subscribers can 
 continue to communicate.

A master, too, may leave its own 

 piconet and become a slave in another.  
All communication in its old network, 
however, is broken until it returns and 
assumes its master function again. 

A master cannot become master of a 
second piconet. If this were to happen, 
both piconets would behave in an identi-
cal manner and form a single network.

Physical data channel
A data channel is represented by a hop-
ping sequence between the 79 possible 
frequencies in the ISM band. Any device 
that is actively participating in a piconet 
must also hop at the same carrier fre-
quency (frequency fi). As soon as a mas-
ter has sent data at frequency fk, a slave 
can respond at frequency fk+1. This pro-
cedure is illustrated in Figure 5. 

It is conventional for the transmissions 
of the master to begin in the even time 
slots and those of the slaves to begin 
in the odd time slots. This characteris-
tic  conforms to the regular time-divi-
sion multiplexing method (TDD here) 
whereby the master uses one half of the 
time slots and the slaves the other half. 

In addition to packets that may occupy 

one time slot, Bluetooth provides for 
packets that may occupy three or five  
time slots (multi-slot packets). As soon  
as a master or slave sends a packet three 
or five time slots long, this transmitter 
will remain on the same frequency.  
There is no frequency change within  
a packet (Fig. 6).

Once the packet has been transferred, 
the frequency hops as determined by the 
hopping sequence (independently of the 
transmission process). In the illustration, 
for example, the frequency hops from  
fk  to fk+3 after the transmission of a 3-slot 
packet). The reason for this behavior is 
that not every station may have received 
the transmission and cannot therefore 
respond specifically to the transfer of 
data in several time slots. For this rea-
son, all stations that are not involved in 
the transmission always continue to hop 
in the sequence specified by the master.

Physical connections
Bluetooth supports both circuit-switched 
and packet-switched data channels. For 
circuit-switched, synchronous communi-
cation, Bluetooth offers a synchronous 
connection-oriented link (SCO), and an 
ACL (Asynchronous Connectionless Link) 
for packet-switched, asynchronous 
 communication. Between two Bluetooth 
devices, there may only ever be one  
ACL link but there can be up to three  
SCO links. The ACL links are the founda-
tion for the data transfer. The SCO links 
are purely voice channels with a data 
rate of 64 kBit/s. The voice is transmitted 
by continuously variable slope delta 
modulation (CVSD) or pulse-code modu-
lation (PCM). A Bluetooth master can 
maintain several different data channels 
between its slaves even at the same time.

Logical data channels
Logical channels refer to different types 
of channels streamed over a physical 
 connection. The data transmitted over  
a physical channel has different logical 
meanings. Bluetooth distinguishes be-
tween two categories of channel: link 
channels, which are used for the ex-
change of control information between 
master and slave; and user channels, 

which transfer data from the user level – 
the applications.

Data packets
A Bluetooth data packet generally 
 comprises three fields: 
 ▶ Access code 
 ▶ Header and 
 ▶ Payload 

A packet may simply comprise the access 
code, or the access code and a header,  
or the access code, header and payload 
(Fig. 7). 

A packet begins with an access code.  
If a header follows, the access code has  
a length of 72 bits, otherwise it is 68 bits 
long. The access code is used for the 
 synchronization and identification of a 
piconet, for device polling and for device 
calls. There are three different types of 
 access code:
 ▶ Channel access code (CAC), the purpose 
of which is to synchronize and identify 
a piconet. The CAC is sent with each 
packet transmitted over the piconet.
 ▶ Device access code (DAC), which is used 
to transfer specific identifiers during 
the device call (e.g. when paging).
 ▶ Inquiry access code (IAC), which is 

used for device polling.

The header of a Bluetooth packet is  
54 bits long and contains information 
about the link (link control information).  
It is made up of the address, packet type, 
flow control, error monitoring and 
checksum fields. The actual length of  
the header (i.e. the sum of the bits in  
the header) is 18 bits. The header is pro-
tected by forward error correction (FEC). 
The bits of the header are sent three 
times (1/3 FEC),  giving a header length of  
54 bits. A receiver can then simply take 
the majority decision; each bit triplet is 
resolved to the value with majority in  
the triplet.

The payload of a Bluetooth packet can 

be up to 341 bytes in size (1,023 bytes 
with EDR). The data field of the payload 
consists of up to three segments: the  
payload header, the payload itself and,  
in certain circumstances, a checksum.
Bluetooth uses 16 different packet 
types, the common feature of all being 
the access code and the header. The 
structure of the payload depends on the 
packet type concerned. Along with pack-
ets for ACL and SCO links, there are also 
packet types for polling the slaves, syn-
chronizing the hopping sequence and 
 acknowledging data transfers.

Bluetooth device addresses
A Bluetooth device is assigned a world-
wide unique Bluetooth device address. 
The address is derived from the IEEE-
802 standard and implemented in the de-
vice by the manufacturer. The 48-bit ad-
dresses are subdivided into three parts
 ▶ LAP (Lower Address Part, containing  

 ▶ UAP (Upper Address Part, containing  

24 bits)

8 bits)

Bluetooth architecture
The Bluetooth architecture is complex. 
This is inherently associated with the 
idea behind general cable emulation.  
The architecture is designed to enable 
new protocols and applications to be 
adapted for the use of Bluetooth. Accord-
ingly, the Bluetooth protocol stack is 
very extensive (Fig. 8 shows a simplified 
version of the protocol stack).

The Bluetooth technology can be sub-

divided into three logical sections:
 ▶ Hardware
 ▶ Host stack
 ▶ Applications

The hardware layer and the host stack  
are defined in the Bluetooth Core Specifi-
cation; the applications are part of the 
Bluetooth Profile Specification.

Hardware-side protocols
The hardware is represented by the 
 Bluetooth chip. This is where the radio 
layer, baseband and link management  
are contained. The radio layer deals with 
the radio transmission, used frequencies, 
modulations and transmission output. 
The baseband represents the link-estab-
lishment mechanisms, the packet struc-
ture and the timing. The link management 
establishes and manages the link between

two devices and also implements security 
and authentication functions. 

The host controller interface (HCI) is 
the interface between the hardware of a 
Bluetooth module and the host-side pro-
tocols. The HCI is a hardware abstraction 
and realizes various interfaces for con-
trolling the Bluetooth hardware and 
transferring data (e.g. via USB or UART).

Host stack
The host stack uses the HCI to control 
the Bluetooth hardware and transfer 
data. The format of this data is deter-
mined by the upper protocol layers. The 
logical link control and adaptation proto-
col (L2CAP) implements the abstraction 
of the hardware’s properties, adapts the 
upper layers of the protocol stack to the 
capabilities of the baseband and hides 
transmission details such as the connec-
tionless or  connection-oriented trans-
mission type. The L2CAP layer essen-
tially has three main functions: 
 ▶ It can receive packets with a length of 
up to 64 kB from the upper layers and 
decomposes them into smaller data 
packets (segments) for processing in 
the lower layers if necessary. At the 
other end, the segments are recom-
posed back into packets.

 ▶ It manages the multiplexing and de-

multiplexing of several packet sources.  
If a packet is being recomposed, the 
L2CAP layer determines to which pro-
tocol of the upper layers the packet is 
forwarded.

 ▶ L2CAP offers functions for negotiating 
quality of service and configuration pa-
rameters. This means, for example, that 
the maximum size of the payload can be 
negotiated so that a device with limited 
resources would not be overwhelmed 
by overly large packets. Using the con-
figuration parameter for the quality of 
service, it is possible to define the 
properties of the data transfer: best ef-
fort (best attempt but with no guarantee 
of data transfer) or guaranteed.

In addition to L2CAP, there are also au-
dio and control protocols that govern the 
handling of audio data and control data. 
Audio applications, for example, can 
make direct use of the baseband layer 
once the audio signals have been coded 
accordingly.

The service discovery protocol (SDP) is 
another important host-side protocol.  
It serves to identify and scan for services 
with specific properties and to describe 
services within range of a Bluetooth de-
vice. Bluetooth devices are meant to be 
able to interact on an ad hoc basis with 
other devices in different environments.  
It is therefore necessary to know which 
services are made available by which de-
vices within range. All devices wishing to 
provide services must use an SDP server; 
for all other devices, an SDP client is suf-
ficient. The SDP prepares the services 
available on a device in a service data-
base. The service information in the pos-
session of the SDP server is stored in a 
service record. The service record con-
sists of a list with service attributes that 
describe the properties of the service 
more precisely and is identified by a  
32-bit service record handle.

Two further protocols in the protocol 
stack form the fundamental basis for the 
interoperability of Bluetooth devices.

The RFCOMM (Radio Frequency Com-

munication) cable emulation protocol 
above the L2CAP layer simulates up to  
60 virtual serial interfaces derived in ac-
cordance with the ETSI 07.10 standard.  
As a result, almost any software that pre-
viously expected a serial interface can 
work with Bluetooth.

TCS BIN (Telephony Control Protocol 

Specification – Binary) is employed as  
the means of controlling telephone and 
telephony functions. This is a bit-ori-
ented protocol for establishing voice 
and data connections between Bluetooth 
devices. The use of appropriate, indus-

130  |  Bus systems  |  Bluetooth

try-wide standards has made it possible, 
here too, to ensure wide-ranging com-
patibility with legacy applications.

Applications
Many more protocols have been adapted 
for the Bluetooth standard (adapted pro-
tocols) and can be found in the protocol 
stack. Internet applications can, for ex-
ample, continue to use TCP/IP through 
the point-to-point protocol (PPP) or the 
Bluetooth network encapsulation proto-
col (BNEP). For the exchange of vCalen-
dars and vCards, it is possible to use the 
object exchange protocol (OBEX) cov-
ered by the IrDA standard.

Profiles
The uppermost layer contains the appli-
cations and profiles. Profiles represent 
“standard solutions” for a particular us-
age scenario. The Bluetooth specification 
currently brings together 13 different 
applications described as profiles. Each 
profile uses a certain choice of protocol; 
in principle, application profiles make  
a  different protocol stack available for 
each application. Profiles describe the 
vertical slice through the Bluetooth pro-
tocol stack; the protocols represent the 
horizontal layers (Fig. 9). Within the pro-
files, the required and optional functions 
of the layers are defined. These stan-
dardized profiles make it possible to en-
sure interoperability between different 
devices.

The four fundamental profiles of the 

Bluetooth specification are:
 ▶ Generic access profile (GAP)
 ▶ Service discovery application profile 

 ▶ Serial port profile (SPP) and
 ▶ Generic object exchange profile 

(SDAP)

(GOEP)

The Bluetooth profiles form the hierar-
chy (Fig. 10). The GAP forms the basis 
and describes all the essential functions 
that a Bluetooth device must fulfill at the 
lowermost level. These include, for ex-
ample, the functions for establishing and 
managing the link, the supported operat-
ing modes and the security of a link.

The SDAP defines the access interface 
for the service discovery protocol (SDP) 
with which devices can discover or poll  
the services offered by other devices.  
SDP builds on the GAP. All Bluetooth de-
vices must implement these two profiles.

The SPP is used by most other 

 Bluetooth profiles. One exception to  
this is the telephony control profile.  
This is always used when Bluetooth is 
 being used for cable emulation or if a 
 serial data connection is to be used.  
The SPP builds on the GAP and uses  
the RFCOMM protocol.

The GOEP defines the fundamental 
functions necessary for the exchange  
of complex objects. It defines a client-
server relationship for the exchange of 
data. Like the SPP, the GOEP provides  
the  foundation for further profiles.

▶ Origin of the name, Bluetooth

The name, Bluetooth, originates from 
King Harald Gormsen, a Danish Viking. 
Harald had the nickname, Blatand.   
In the Middle Ages, Bla actually meant 
dark, while Blatand made reference 
to the dark figure of Harald Gormsen. 
Bluetooth, therefore, is not a direct 
translation of Blatand. 

In the 10th Century, Harald Gorm-
sen united large parts of Denmark 
and Norway. The Bluetooth wireless 
system developed 1,000 years later 
unified a wide range of different infor-
mation, data processing and wireless 
mobile devices. This is why it was 
named after King Harald.

132  |  Bus systems  |  FlexRay

bus access is controlled by the use of mini-
slots. Minislots are small time windows  
in which a defined message can be trans-
ferred. This access method is also known 
as FTDMA (Flexible Time Division Multi-
ple Access).

With messages transmitted in the static 
component of the cycle, the transfer prop-
erties can be assured in accordance with 
known methods. In the dynamic compo-
nent, messages are sent as required. In this 
case, messages are prioritized based on 
the message ID. The division between the 
static and dynamic component is freely 
configurable but it cannot be modified 
later during system operation. The same 
applies to the slot lengths in the static 
range, which, while configurable, must re-
main constant once operation is underway.
FlexRay systems can be equipped with 

two transmission channels, with each 
channel having separate lines. This makes 
it possible to create a redundant data 
transfer or increase the available band-
width for specific applications. The latter 
can be used both for the parallel transmis-
sion of information of two network nodes 
and for the faster transfer of information 
of one node.

FlexRay operates at a maximum bit rate 

of 10 MBit/s, which is achievable in opti-
mal environmental conditions. A rate of  
up to 20 MBit/s is achievable if two chan-
nels are used without redundant access.  
In addition to the bit rate of 10 MBit/s, 
which is the only bit rate defined in Speci-
fication 2.1 dated 15th December 2005, 
there are endeavors to support lower bit 
rates of 2.5 or 5 MBit/s.

FlexRay

Overview
FlexRay is a field that was designed to 
 support open and closed-loop control 
technologies in the automotive sector. 
 Development focused on the suitability  
for use in active safety systems in particu-
lar. FlexRay therefore offers transfers with 
guaranteed compliance with transfer 
properties, high bit rates and a fault-
 tolerant design.

The development of FlexRay, managed 
by the FlexRay Consortium, goes back to 
cooperation between German automotive 
manufacturers, BMW and DaimlerChrysler. 
In 1999 these two companies began to 
compile requirements for a new communi-
cation system. In the process, develop-
ment would incorporate experience 
gained from the byteflight system of  
BMW and the prototype development  
of  DaimlerChrysler.

The aim of FlexRay is to provide a sys-
tem with high transfer rates that will work 
in a deterministic and fault-tolerant man-
ner while being as flexible as possible to 
use and expand. The main fields of appli-
cation of the FlexRay are drivetrain sys-
tems (drive) and active safety systems with 
no mechanical fall-back level (x-by-wire). 
However, the areas of passive safety sys-
tems and comfort/convenience and body 
electronics are also supported.

To support these very different domains, 
FlexRay uses two different types of bus ac-
cess. For deterministic transfer properties, 
it offers time-controlled bus access. In the 
case of applications whose transfers place 
less demanding requirements on transfer 
properties, it is desirable to make as effec-
tive use of the available transfer capacity 
as possible. To combine these two ap-
proaches, communication takes place in 
cycles. In each cycle, there is firstly a static 
transmission component in which bus ac-
cess is controlled by TDMA (Time Division 
Multiple Access). There then follows a dy-
namic transmission component in which 

Bus systems  |  FlexRay  |  133

Areas of application
The areas of application of the FlexRay are 
very diverse. By offering redundant, time-
controlled and fault-tolerant transfers,  
not only is FlexRay suitable for use in 
 active safety systems with no mechanical 
fall-back level and in the area of the drive-
train, but its optional, dynamic transmis-
sion range means that it is able to support 
application in the areas of passive safety 
systems and networking in the body and 
comfort/convenience domains.

With the high bandwidth of up to 
20 MBit/s for non-redundant transfers,  
it is even conceivable, in theory, that 
FlexRay could be used for the transfer  
of audio or highly compressed video.

Topology
Point-to-point
The simplest configuration of a FlexRay 
system is the direct link between two 
 network nodes. The maximum distance 
between the two nodes is 24 m in this 
 configuration.

Bus topology
Between 4 and 22 nodes can be connected 
in a bus topology. The maximum distance 
between any two nodes in a bus topology 
may be 24 m.

Star topology
A star topology is another architectural 
variant of the FlexRay network. Both ac-
tive and passive couplers are supported.

Passive star topology
3 to 22 nodes can be connected in a pas-
sive star. Here, too, the distance between 
any two nodes cannot be greater than 
24 m.

Active star topology
An active star topology can be viewed as  
a point-to-point link between a number  
of nodes and an active coupler. In this to-
pology, therefore, only the distance from  
a node to the coupler is of importance. 
This cannot be more than 24 m.

Apart from the connection lengths and 

the number of connectable nodes, the 
most important difference between an 
 active and a passive star topology is in  
the achievable bit rates. With the use of 
passive couplers, the achievable data  
rate (approx. 1 MBit/s) is below the rate  
that can be achieved with active couplers 
(up to 10 MBit/s).

Cascaded star topologies
Cascaded star topologies are the product 
of several active star topologies linked 
 together. In a FlexRay system, a topology 
like this is limited to three cascaded star 
topologies.

Hybrid topologies
Hybrid topologies are a blend of topolo-
gies from bus and star topologies, e.g. the 
connection of several bus topologies to a 
star topology instead of individual nodes.

Two-channel topologies
Since it is possible to implement both 
channels of a FlexRay system indepen-
dently, different topologies can be used  
for each channel. For example, one chan-
nel could be realized as an active star 
 topology, the other as a bus topology.

Hardware
FlexRay controller of a subscriber 
A FlexRay node (Fig. 1) comprises the  
host processor, a communication control-
ler (CC) and one bus driver (BD) for each 
channel to which the node is connected. 
Optionally, each node may contain a  
bus guardian (BG) for monitoring each  
bus driver and the bus guardian may re-
ceive information through an additional 
host processor.

It is optional whether a network node  

is connected to one or both channels;  
here, at the very most, the requirements 
from the field of application of the network 
node take effect.

Transmission agents
The transmission agent for a FlexRay sys-
tem is of a twisted-pair cabling design, 
where shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP) 
cabling may be used.

Each of the two FlexRay channels con-
sists of two wires designated bus plus (BP) 
and bus minus (BM).

Host processor
The host processor gathers information 
from the sensors, which is forwarded to 
the communication controller for trans-

mission. The information received by the 
communication controller is forwarded to 
the actuators responsible for processing.

Communication controller
The communication controller (CC) real-
izes all aspects of the FlexRay system 
 relating to the protocol. Its tasks include 
scheduling, synchronizing with other net-
work nodes, creating a macrotick signal, 
creating a bit stream from the information 
of the host or controlling bus access.

Bus driver
The bus driver (BD) assumes the role of a 
transceiver. It converts logical information 
into physical voltages that are carried on 
copper wires, and vice versa. The role of 
the BD also includes a protective function 
against electrostatic discharge (ESD).

Furthermore, the BD monitors the states 
of the BP and BM and is thereby able to de-
tect whether the bus is affected by physical 
faults.

The BD also processes wakeup signals 

and, optionally, is able to control the 
power management of the network node 
because functions of the node can be 
switched off.

Bus guardian
The bus guardian (BG) is a device that will 
only permit transmissions if the connected 
network node is authorized to send a mes-
sage. With this system, it is theoretically 
possible for faulty network nodes to inter-
fere at the very most with their own trans-
mission but not with the transmissions of 
other network nodes.

The FlexRay protocol only provides the 
framework for use of a BG: its use is not a 
mandatory specification. Specification 2.0 
only described a local bus guardian that 
would operate inside the network node 
and monitor access to one of the channels. 
A critical aspect of this concept was that 
correct operation of the bus guardian in a 
faulty network node could not be guaran-
teed as a consequence of the integration  
of the bus guardian in the node and the 
permission for the bus guardian to access 
the oscillator of the network node.

Specification 2.1 contains a refined 
 concept for the local bus guardian and 
 introduces the concept of a central bus 
guardian.

Local bus guardian
The local bus guardian (node-local bus 
guardian) is implemented as a stand-alone 
CC inside the network node that monitors 
operation of a CC (Fig. 2). Its synchroniza-
tion process is independent of that of the 
CC’s; in particular, the CC and BG have 
 separate oscillators.

In addition, it is also possible for the BG 
and CC to be controlled by dedicated host 
processors that communicate with each 
other. This is, however, not mandatory.

As a consequence of direct control lines 

(bus-guardian enable, BGE) between the 
BG, CC and BD, information can only be 
transferred from the CC to the BD if the  
BG permits this transfer to take place.

Central bus guardian
The central bus guardian (CBG, Fig. 3) was 
a new feature introduced with Specifica-
tion 2.1. It operates in the coupler of a  
star topology and monitors the operation 
of all connected nodes or networks. Faults, 
such as short-circuits on buses or network 
nodes, that transmit information like a 
“babbling idiot” with no consideration of 
the transmission window, and thus inter-
fere with orderly communication, can be 
detected by a CBG and suitable counter-

measures may then be taken. As a result, 
the effects of these faults can be confined 
to small areas of the network.

the bus driver looks out for the transmis-
sion of a wakeup signal, in response to 
which the node is set to wakeup mode.

Operating modes
In addition to normal operation, a FlexRay 
system also supports the complete initial-
ization of the network from sleep to 
standby (Fig. 4). In order for this system 
start to function, the BDs of all network 
nodes have the capability to detect wakeup 
signals on the bus and to start the remain-
ing other components of the dedicated 
network node.

Special network nodes that may be con-

nected to the starter motor of a vehicle,  
for example, generate the wakeup signal. 

The system start is split into the wakeup 
and startup phases. The wakeup phase in-
volves the activation of the network nodes 
by the wakeup signal. In the startup phase, 
the network nodes are initialized and syn-
chronized.

If the function of a node is not required 
for the time being, the node can be set to  
a standby mode in which all operations  
of the coding and decoding process are 
stopped. This reduces the energy con-
sumption of the node. In sleep mode, the 
power consumption of a network node is 
at its minimum. In this mode, all functions 
of the network node are deactivated: only 

4 Wakeup sequence

Sending and receiving
A bus driver connects a FlexRay network 
node to the channel that contains a re-
ceiver and transmitter. If a controller is 
connected to both channels, it follows that 
there must be two receivers and transmit-
ters available in the network node.

Protocol
Protocol layers
The FlexRay protocol is built on five core 
mechanisms: 
 ▶ Coding and decoding
 ▶ Control of bus access (media access 

 control, MAC) 

 ▶ Processing of frames and symbols 
 ▶ Clock synchronization and 
 ▶ Schedule monitoring by the bus 

 guardian

Unlike in other network protocols, with 
FlexRay there are interfaces between all 
core mechanisms. This requires a process 
that coordinates and synchronizes the 
changes in the core mechanisms. This is 
the task of the protocol operation control 
(POC).

FlexRay gives the host system the capabil-
ity of influencing all five core mechanisms 
directly. To arrange this, communication 
takes place through an interface – the con-
troller host interface (CHI) – between the 
network node and host.

Concentrating on the main interfaces, 
the task areas can be arranged as a proto-
col stack (Fig. 5). At the top level is the ap-
plication, which forwards its commands to 
the CHI. Under the CHI is the POC, which 
in turn has access to the MAC, clock syn-
chronization and frame & symbol process-
ing. In the next lower layer are the pro-
cesses for coding and decoding. The low-
ermost level is represented by the transfer 
characteristics of the physical layer.

The bottom three layers are in nodes 

that are connected to both channels: 
 double presence because these functions 
have to be fulfilled for each channel sepa-
rately. More precisely speaking, this 
means that for one node connected to  
both FlexRay channels there is double 
availability of synchronization, MAC, 
frame & symbol processing, coding  
and decoding, and physical layer.

Coding on the physical layer
For coding, FlexRay uses a NRZ method 
(Non-Return to Zero) in which the two 
identical transmission states are not di-
vided by a range in which the voltage falls 
back to a zero value. This type of coding 
makes it necessary to have mechanisms 
with which a network node can divide the 
transmitted states. To this end, FlexRay 
adds a sequence behind each transmitted 
byte: the byte start sequence (BSS). From 
this sequence, each node can detect when 
a byte has been transmitted and, with this 
information, encode the individual bits  
of the transmission.

By applying different voltages to the  
two wires of one channel, it is possible  
to create four bus states, which are desig-
nated Idle_LP, Idle, Data_0 and Data_1  
(Fig. 6).

A bus state is identified by measuring 
the differential voltage. Here, the bus volt-
age (uBus) is made equal to the difference 
between uBM and uBP (voltages at BP and 
BM).

With this method, the data transfer is pro-
tected against external electromagnetic 
 interference because these act equally on 
both wires and are canceled out in the dif-
ference.

Idle_LP (LP = low power) is the state in 
which a very low voltage of -200 mV and 
200 mV is present at BP and BM. This state, 
for example, is used to identify the start of 
a transmission.

In Idle state, a voltage of 2.5 V with a tol-
erance of 500 mV is present at BP and BM. 
To set the channel to Data_0 state, at 
least one transmitting node must apply  
a negative differential voltage of -600 mV 
to the channel.

For the channel to be set to Data_1 state, 
at least one transmitting node must apply 
a positive differential voltage of 600 mV  
to the channel.

If the transmission of an information 
signal is neither blocked by the bus guard-
ian nor the communication controller, a 
HIGH bit is signaled by the Data_1 channel 
state and a LOW bit by Data_0.

Generation of a frame bit stream
Before a node can transmit a frame con-
taining the data of the host, the frame is 
converted into a bit stream. To this end, 
the frame is first decomposed into individ-
ual bytes. The start of a frame is populated 
with a transmission start sequence (TSS) 
followed by a frame start sequence (FSS) 
(Fig. 7). From the bytes of the frames, an 
extended byte sequence (EBS) is then gen-
erated whereby each frame byte is pre-
ceded with a byte start sequence (BSS).
The 24-bit checksum (CRC) for this  
bit sequence (TSS+FSS+EBS) is now calcu-
lated and appended to the bit sequence.  
To finish the bit stream, a frame end 
 sequence (FES) is appended.

If the frame belongs to the dynamic seg-

ment, a dynamic trailing sequence (DTS) 
can be additionally appended to prevent 
another node from beginning its transmis-
sion on the channel prematurely.

Communication cycle
Each FlexRay cycle (Fig. 8) contains a 
static segment that is transmitted as the 
first part of the cycle. The static segment 
contains a fixed number of transmission 
ranges, the “static slots”.

Optionally, there may be a dynamic seg-
ment in the FlexRay cycle and this is trans-
ferred in second place. Each dynamic seg-
ment contains a fixed, freely configurable 
number of “minislots”.

Also optional is the symbol window, 
which is transmitted as the third element 
of the cycle. It can be used for the trans-
mission of an individual symbol and has 
the same size as a static slot.

To terminate the cycle, there is a phase – 
network idle time (NIT) – in which the bus 
is set to idle state. In general, the length  
of the NIT corresponds to the remaining 
macroticks not used by the static and dy-
namic segment or symbol window. This is 
not the case if it was detected during syn-
chronization that an offset correction is 
 required through which the length of the 
NIT can be increased or reduced.

Bus systems  |  FlexRay  |  139

Static segment
The static segment comprises a fixed num-
ber of equally sized transmission windows 
(static slots), which are sent simultane-
ously on both channels. Exactly one frame 
can be sent in each static slot. Both the size 
and quantity of the static slots in a static 
segment are configured during integra-
tion.

Bus access in the static segment is 
 controlled by a TDMA method whereby,  
in each slot, the frame with the corre-
sponding frame ID is sent. Frame ID 1  
is therefore sent in slot 1, frame ID 2 in  
slot 2 and thus frame ID n in slot n.

Dynamic segment
Unlike in the static segment, the transmis-
sions in the dynamic segment are not of 
fixed length. To control bus access, “mini-
slots” are used that hold the same fixed 
number of macroticks for all nodes con-
nected to the network. Macroticks are 
ranges in which exactly one frame can  
be transmitted.

“Dynamic slots” (transmission windows 
of variable size) are now created based on 
the minislots. The maximum size of a dy-
namic slot is limited by a fixed number of 
minislots specified during configuration.

To identify the end of a transmission,  
a phase in which the channel is idle (dy-
namic slot idle phase) is added to the end 
of a dynamic slot. The phase in which the 
transmission takes place is called the dy-
namic slot transmission phase.

Another difference between the dy-
namic and static segment is that the coun-
ters of slots transferred are incremented 
synchronously on both channels in the 
 dynamic segment. In the dynamic seg-
ment, the counter of both channels is in-
cremented independently in line with  
the current transmission status (Fig. 9).

Symbol window
The symbol window makes it possible to 
send a collision avoidance symbol (CAS)  
or a media access test symbol (MTS).  
These two symbols are identical and  
help to prevent collisions during the 
 system-startup phase.

The third symbol defined in the FlexRay 

protocol – the wakeup symbol (WUS) – is 
not permitted to be sent in the symbol win-
dow. It serves only to generate a wakeup 
pattern (WUP), which is used during the 
system startup.

Network idle time (NIT)
During the NIT, a network node corrects 
the ascertained time deviations of its inter-
nal clock. It also gives the network node 
the opportunity in this phase to make im-
plementation-dependent adjustments and 
changes to settings relating to the commu-
nication cycle.

Clock control
In both the static and the dynamic part of 
the communication cycle, FlexRay reverts 
to the identifiers of the transmission win-
dow in which a node may transmit. If this 
method is to be successful, it is necessary 
for all nodes connected to the network  
to have synchronous time information.

For this purpose, selected messages from 
the static part of the cycle are used (sync 
frames) and are transmitted by the net-
work nodes that are connected to both 
channels. 

In a distributed communication system, 

each network node generally needs its 
own internal clock for setting transmission 
timing correctly. As a consequence of tem-
perature and voltage fluctuations and pro-
duction-related precision tolerances, these 
internal clocks can soon deviate from an 
abstract, system-wide global time. In the 
case of a system such as FlexRay, which 
controls bus access by means of time slots, 
the synchronization of all network nodes 
plays an especially important role because, 
without a standardized, global time preset 
for all nodes, the specified transmission 
windows cannot be maintained and may 
break down.

Clock control hierarchy
In a FlexRay system, clocking is controlled 
on three levels (Fig. 10). The bottom level 
is represented by the microticks, which 
are derived directly from the oscillator 
clock of the network node. A microtick 
is therefore not a system-wide variable, 
but only relevant to the node concerned.
At the next level up, the clock is con-
trolled by means of macroticks – ranges  
in which exactly one frame can be sent. 
Within fixed tolerances, macroticks form 
the lowermost system-wide time unit.  
Each network node determines the dura-
tion of a macrotick in microticks. The 
number of microticks per macrotick does 
not have to be the same for all macroticks.
The top level is characterized by a clock 
control based on the communication cycle, 
which always contains the same, fixed 
number of macroticks.

Time synchronization
A synchronization method is required in 
order to guarantee a standardized time 
across the entire system. The basic para-
meters for timing are the number of 
 microticks per communication cycle  
(pMicroPerCycle), the duration of a com-
munication cycle (gdCycle) and the dura-
tion of a microtick (pdMicrotick), where 
the relationship between each is deter-
mined by the following equation:

pMicroPerCycle = round(  

gdCycle

_____________ 
  )
 
pdMicrotick

During operation of a FlexRay network, 
the clocks of the oscillators of various net-
work nodes will not be equal or even sim-
ply remain constant. They will fluctuate  
in response to outside influences. This 
 deviation is balanced by two corrective 
measures: the gradient correction and the 
inclusion of an offset in the communica-
tion cycle.

Fault-tolerant average algorithm
Since an individual node can only observe 
the differences between the expected time 
at which a transmission should have been 
actioned and the actual time at which the 
transmission took place, a fault-tolerant 
average algorithm (FTM), as described by 
J. L. Welch and N. A. Lynch, is used in both 
corrective measures. The measured time 
differences of all transmitted sync frames 
are sorted by their value. If more than 
seven sync frames were received, the two 
highest and two lowest values are removed 
from the list. If between three and seven 
sync frames were received, the highest and 
the lowest value are removed. For fewer 
than three sync frames, the average is 
 derived from all measured differences.

Gradient correction
With gradient correction, deviations in  
the transmission frequency of a node are 
continuously corrected during the com-
munication cycle. The node here checks 
the transmission frequencies of all other 
nodes. By means of the FTAA, these  
values are used to adjust the node’s  
own transmission frequency.

Offset correction
Offset correction is a way to correct devia-
tions in the communication-cycle phase  
by including an offset in the NIT. With this 
method, the node similarly employs the 
FTAA to determine its phase difference  
in relation to the other nodes of the net-
work and uses it to determine the offset 
required to shorten or extend the NIT 
phase. Since all nodes use this approach, 
all nodes can initiate the transmission of  
a cycle in a synchronous manner.

Timing
Transmissions in the FlexRay system  
are timed by action points, which are 
 specially-marked macrotick boundaries.  
A transmission in a static slot begins once 
a static-slot action point has been reached. 
The position of this action point in a mac-
rotick is defined system-wide.

In a dynamic slot, a transmission begins 

once a minislot action point has been 
reached and ends at a subsequent minislot 
action point. This method ensures that 
there is always an idle period between 
 individual transmissions.

Frame format
FlexRay uses the same format in both  
the static and dynamic part of the frame. 
The format can be broken down into three 
parts: header, payload segment and trailer 
segment (Fig. 11).

The startup frame indicator reveals that 
this frame is a startup frame. Startup 
frames are used in the network’s starting 
phase and may only be sent by special 
coldstart nodes.

The indicators are followed by the  

frame ID, payload length, header CRC and 
cycle count.

The frame ID has a length of 11 bits and 

corresponds to the number of the slot in 
which the frame is sent. In one cycle, each 
frame ID exists only once on each channel.
The payload length expresses the size  
of the information sent in the payload seg-
ment. Since the payload in a FlexRay frame 
is always sent in 2-byte words, a 62 in the 
payload length field indicates, for exam-
ple, that 124 bytes of payload are being 
transmitted in the payload segment.

In the static segment, the payload length 

field always contains the same value 
 because the size of information here is 
constant for all frames. Of course, this 
property does not apply to frames in the 
dynamic segment.

In the header CRC, an 11-bit CRC value 

is transmitted. This is formed from the 
polynomial

x11 + x9 + x8 + x7 + x2 +1.

Since the information in the header seg-
ment is constant for all frames in the static 
segment, the header CRC value can be cal-
culated offline and assigned to the network 
node through configuration settings.

If a frame in the dynamic segment is 
 always of the same size, it is possible here 
also for the CRC value to be calculated off-
line.

The final field in the header segment  
is the cycle count. This field contains the 
count number of the cycle in which the 
sending network node is currently active.

Header segment
The header segment contains a total of  
five bytes, at the start of which is a series 
of indicators.

The reserved bit is intended for future 
modifications to the protocol and is sent as 
a logical “0”.

The payload preamble indicator indi-
cates whether or not the payload segment 
contains a network-management vector 
(NMVector). An NMVector enables the host 
processor to transmit data directly without 
first being processed and prepared by the 
CC.

The null frame indicator indicates a null 
frame that contains no usable information.
The sync frame indicator indicates that 

this frame is intended to be used for sys-
tem synchronization. This indicator may 
only be set by network nodes that operate 
as sync nodes.

Payload segment
The payload segment has a maximum 
length of 254 bytes, which are transmitted 
in 2-byte words.

The payload segment customarily trans-
fers the payload that is further processed 
by the host processors. Optionally, how-
ever, an NMVector may also be sent in the 
payload segment, or a 16-bit message ID. 
With the assignment of message IDs,  
it is possible to send several data blocks in 
a frame. For this purpose, the message ID 
is placed at the front of the other data by 
the host processor as application data.

Trailer segment
The trailer segment contains a single  
field in which a 24-bit CRC checksum 
(frame CRC) is sent. The polynomial used 
to determine the frame CRC is:

x24 + x22 + x19 + x18 + x16 + x15 + x14 +
x13 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x6 + x3 + x+1

Standardization
FlexRay Group
FlexRay is a protocol specified by the 
FlexRay Group. The FlexRay Group was 
founded in 2000 by the companies, BMW, 
DaimlerChrysler, Motorola and Philips 
Semiconductors (www.flexray-group.com).
The members of the FlexRay Group are 

organized in a hierarchy. They also have 
different levels of influence on the further 

development of FlexRay, depending on  
the obligations that they have accepted. 
The uppermost group is represented by 
the core partners, which first and foremost 
include the founding members. Alongside 
the core partners are the premium associ-
ates and associate memberships.

By 2004 General Motors, Bosch and 

Volkswagen had joined the FlexRay Group 
as core partners. In 2004 Freescale took 
over Motorola’s position in the group of 
core partners.

ple, individual actuators can be targeted 
for activation to check them for correct 
operation. At the end of the line (EOL),  
the diagnosis interface is used to test the 
electronic control unit and make changes 
to configurations (e.g. immobilizer, trans-
mission type). It is even possible to pro-
gram the entire flash EPROM using end- 
of-line programming.

Diagnostics requires an interface for con-
necting the tester to the electronic control 
units. For communication, there are basi-
cally two options available at the present 
time:
 ▶ K line and
 ▶ CAN bus

The K-line network is not a bus in the true 
sense, which means that collisions may 
 occur. Since most electronic control units 
have a CAN interface for the exchange of 
data between electronic systems, this op-
tion for communication with the tester is 
gaining ever more in importance. 

Various protocols are implemented on 
the interfaces. These tend to be the CARB 
or official protocol and the manufacturer-
specific communication, which can be 
closely related in their properties and 
functions. It is even possible to use both 
interfaces: CARB-relevant functions run on 
the CAN, manufacturer-specific functions 
on the K line.

Figure 2 provides an overview of the 
standards and the various layers of the  
OSI reference model.

Diagnosis interfaces

Diagnosis legislation (e.g. CARB, California 
Air Resources Board) demands constant 
monitoring of emission-related compo-
nents in various electronic systems (OBD, 
On-Board Diagnosis). Faults (e.g. electrical 
short-circuits of sensors, implausible op-
erating states) are stored in a fault memory 
in the control unit. These faults can be 
read using a scan tool (official testing sta-
tion) or workshop tester. For this purpose, 
there is a socket in the footwell, dashboard 
or center console of the vehicle to which 
the tester is connected by means of a stan-
dard connector (ISO 15031-3) (Fig. 1).

Using a workshop tester, the after-sales 

service is able to read the entire fault 
memory: emission-related faults and 
 vehicle-specific faults (e.g. from Motronic, 
ABS). With the information stored in the 
fault memory, it is possible to diagnose a 
fault and repair it efficiently. The tester 
can also be used to clear the fault memory. 
Furthermore, measured values and con-
trol-unit identification values can be evalu-
ated. Using the workshop tester, it is also 
possible to control special diagnostic func-
tions. With actuator diagnosis, for exam-

Diagnostic protocol
The communication method in diagnostics 
is characterized by the fact that the tester 
(client) addresses one or several electronic 
control units (servers) and requests data 
output (e.g. from the fault memory) or an 
action (e.g. actuator diagnosis). These ser-
vices and the transmission agent are de-
fined in the various protocols.

KWP 71
This protocol was developed in collabora-
tion with Bosch as the first standardized 
serial interface and is based on a 5-baud 
initialization and byte handshake. For ad-
dressing, the protocol provides for the use 
of a unidirectional line (L line). The line  
for data exchange (K line) is bidirectional. 
 Alternatively, if the L line is not used at  
all in the system architecture, the K line 
can also be used for addressing because 
addressing and data exchange are two 
chronologically sequential states. The way 
in which communication is established is 
predefined, the services are standardized.

KWP 2000 (ISO 14230: 1-3)
This diagnostic protocol connects a tester 
to the electronic control units using a  
K line. In the KWP 2000 standard, there 
are various possibilities for the way in 
which communication is established (fast 
initialization and 5-baud initialization). 
The communication services are specified 
but there is some freedom for customer-
specific adaptations.

ISO 15765: 1-3 (CAN)
This standard reproduces the existing 
 protocols, ISO 14230: 1-4, on the CAN.  
It defines a way to leave untouched the 
fundamental format of messages ex-
changed between tester and electronic 
control unit and to transmit them on the 
CAN bus. 

CARB 
The Californian environmental authority 
(CARB) introduced guidelines to promote 
support for a standardized interface.  
The CARB protocol is built on existing 
standards and specifies the data flow and 
timing (transport layer). This is established 
in ISO 14230-4/ISO 9141-2 for the K line 
and in ISO 15765-4 for the CAN. The actual 
communication messages (services) in the 
application layer are precisely defined in 
ISO 15031-5/SAE J1979 and permit no 
manufacturer-specific deviations.

In California, every newly registered vehi-
cle must support at least one of these pro-
tocols with all emission-related electronic 
control units. The European counterpart  
is the EOBD standard.

Application protocols
The increasing complexity of control-unit 
functions places high demands on the 
 tuning and optimization of these systems 
to suit the types of engine and vehicle con-
cerned. This process is known as applica-
tion engineering. For this purpose, an 
 application system is connected to the 
electronic control unit. The application 
protocol for the K line is the McMess pro-
tocol, and the CCP protocol for the CAN.

McMess
With the McMess protocol, parameters in the 
electronic control unit can be modified and 
operands recorded. In a special application 
mode, the protocol describes the method 
and contents of communication between ap-
plication system and electronic control unit 
for the K line. With McMess, for example, the 
measuring device is able to read the contents 
of the variable memory (e.g. sensor values, 
measured values) quickly.

CCP (CAN Calibration Protocol)
The CCP protocol describes the contents 
of communication between an application 
system and an electronic control unit if 
these communicate on the CAN bus.  
CCP allows electronic control units in 
the network to function at higher payload 
rates than on the K line.

Communication on the K line
Physical layout 
The diagnostic tester connects to one or 
several electronic control units using the 
K-line system (Fig. 3). All electronic con-
trol units have equal rights. Communica-
tion flows bidirectionally between the tes-
ter and the electronic control units. This 
means that data can be received and sent 
by all subscribers. However, only one sub-
scriber is ever able to send at a given time.
The communication is an asynchronous 
process. There is no additional line for the 
transmission of a clock signal. The baud 
rate on the K line is between 1,200 and 
10,400 baud in accordance with ISO stan-
dards. In special applications (e.g. manu-
facturer-specific flash programming),  
it could even be as high as 250 kBd. 

Data transfer on the K line is realized as 
follows: the resistor in the tester increases 
the potential of the line – provided no elec-
tronic control unit is sending on it – to bat-
tery-voltage level (Fig. 4). If an electronic 
control unit is activated, it connects its  
K-line connection to the shared ground 
and therefore switches the potential of the 
K line to ground. Each of the connected 
electronic control units is able to detect 
that one of the bus subscribers is actively 
accessing the K line.

Message format
The message format of the KWP 2000 
 protocol comprises three parts (Fig. 5):
 ▶ Header
 ▶ Data bytes and
 ▶ Checksum

Checksum
The 1-byte checksum is always positioned 
at the end of a message. It contains the 
value of the modulo 256 sum across all 
bytes in the message – apart from the 
checksum itself.

Header
The header is made up of no more than 
four bytes.
 ▶ The format byte (Fmt) contains informa-
tion about the form and composition of 
the message. Two bits (A0 and A1) pro-
vide address information, while six bits 
(L0 to L5) provide the quantity of data 
bytes. With this coding, there can be up 
to 63 data bytes. If L0 to L5 are set to 
zero, the number of payload bytes must 
be coded using the length byte (Len).
 ▶ The target address (Tgt) indicates the 
communication partner for which the 
information is destined.

 ▶ The source address (Src) indicates the 
communication partner that sent the 
 information.

 ▶ The length byte (Len) specifies the quan-
tity of payload bytes (max. 255 bytes). 
Up to a value of 63, the coding can take 
place in Fmt. For more than 63, the 
length must be specified using this byte.

The existence of a target and source ad-
dress as well as the length byte is depen-
dent on the parameters from the format 
byte.

Data bytes
Up to 255 bytes of payload can be sent per 
message. The first byte of the payload is 
 always a service-identification byte (SId). 
The subsequent data bytes are data that 
differ depending on the service con-
cerned.

Initialization
To be able to send messages, each elec-
tronic control unit must support a subset 
of the possible message formats. At the 
 beginning of communication, the format 
supported by the electronic control unit  
is communicated to the tester by means  
of key bytes as part of initialization.

The ISO standards specify which of the 
possible initialization procedures are cus-
tomary for ECU diagnostics. The following 
initialization procedures are supported:
 ▶ 5-baud initialization and
 ▶ Fast initialization

These different initialization methods are 
used either for CARB diagnostics or for 
 after-sales diagnostics. Furthermore, a 
 distinction can be made between physical 
initialization and functional initialization, 
which introduces the topic of “point-to-
point” or “point-to-multi” communication. 
With functional initialization, a group of 
electronic control units is addressed and 
initialized. A function initialization can 
only be successful if all the electronic con-
trol units of this group support the same 
baud rate, the same transmission timing 
and the same protocol. By contrast, only 
one electronic control unit is initialized in 
the case of physical initialization.

5-baud initialization
Communication is initiated by means of  
a 5-baud address sent by the tester. It is 
thus possible for each electronic control 
unit to be addressed individually and ad-
dressing is clearly separate from the data 
transfer.

The tester outputs the address onto the 
K line at a transfer rate of 5 baud (Fig. 6). 
10 bits (eight data bits, one start and one 
stop bit) take approx. 2 seconds. 

On receiving the address, the electronic 

control unit responds with the baud-rate 

recognition pattern. From the bit sequence 
01010101 (binary format), the tester de-
termines the baud rate of the electronic 
control unit, which may be between 1,200 
and 10,400 baud. The electronic control 
unit then transmits the two key bytes, 
which communicate the header format  
and timing method that the electronic 
 control unit supports. As acknowledgment 
that communication has been successfully 
established, the tester sends the comple-
ment of the second key byte back to the 
electronic control unit and, in return, re-
ceives from the electronic control unit the 
complement of the address. Initialization 
is then complete and the regular data 
transfer may begin.

Fast initialization
Fast initialization establishes communica-
tion in a shorter time than 5-baud initial-
ization. With fast initialization, the tester 
sends a wakeup pattern (WuP) comprising 
a low and high phase, each lasting 25 ms 
(Fig. 7). At the end of the WuP, the tester 
sends the StartCommunication Service at a 
rate of 10,400 baud. The electronic control 
unit returns a positive reply containing the 
key bytes. Initialization is then complete 
and regular communication may begin.

CARB initialization
CARB initialization is a special case of  
5-baud initialization, although CARB may 
also be activated by fast initialization.  
A functional initialization of all connected 
electronic control units is achieved with 
the fixed address 0x33. The baud rate is 
permanently set at 10,400 Bd. The require-
ments are described in more detail in 
ISO 14230-4 and ISO 9141-2. 

One of the outcomes of these standards 
is that all emission-related electronic con-
trol units fitted in a vehicle may only sup-
port one protocol: ISO 14230-4, ISO 9141-2 
or SAE J1850. A mixture of protocols in the 
same vehicle is not permitted.

Key bytes
The electronic control unit uses key bytes 
to inform the tester of which header bytes, 
length bytes and timing method are sup-
ported. The key-byte decoding process  
is defined in ISO 9141 and ISO 14230-2.

Arbitration
Arbitration is a means of preventing or de-
tecting collisions of data sent by different 
electronic control units at the same time. 
Arbitration is necessary if a correct response 
to the tester request is to be received in 
the case of functional communication  
(e.g. reading the fault memory of all emis-
sion-related electronic control units using 
a scan tool). Collisions can be expected 
 because more than one electronic control 
unit is permitted to send following initial-
ization by the tester.

Arbitration is only relevant to data 

transfer on the K line.

Collision prevention
To prevent collisions following a tester re-
quest, each electronic control unit checks 
the K line for a falling edge after a time of 
P2min. A falling edge may be interference, 
or another electronic control unit has 
 already been sending data.

If a falling edge was detected, the elec-
tronic control unit delays sending its  
own data until the bus has returned to  
idle state and the P2min time period has 
again elapsed. Only then may it attempt  
to send its data again.

Collision detection
A collision cannot be prevented if two 
electronic control units send at the same 
time. In this event, the collision still has  
to be detected. This is possible by monitor-
ing the K line. To this end, the electronic 
control units reread their own transmitted 
byte through the serial interface.

In Figure 8, two electronic control units 

(ECU 1 and ECU 2) send a start bit at the 
same time. ECU 2 then sends a 0 (dominant 
bit) and ECU 1 a 1 (recessive bit). The 0 
 appears on the K line. With bit 2, the exact 
opposite is true. Here, ECU 1 persists with 
the dominant level. When the complete 
byte has been transferred, the electronic 
control units compare the byte sent on the 
K line with the byte they have read. In the 
example, a recessive level was overwritten 
by a dominant level for both electronic 
control units. From this, both electronic 
control units deem the transfer to have 
been faulty and retreat from sending.

To prevent cyclical collisions, the elec-
tronic control unit reports after a time of 
P2min, which is calculated in accordance 
with a specific algorithm.

Let us assume that ECU 2 in the previous 
example sent a 1 as its first data bit. ECU 1 
would then receive nothing from the data 
transfer of ECU 2 and would continue to 
establish communication. ECU 2, however, 
detects the collision in bit 2 and retreats. 
The collision in this event is non-destruc-
tive.

Communication on the CAN
Physical layout
A CAN interface containing the necessary 
hardware already exists in many electronic 
control units. This bus system can also be 
used for diagnostics. It is possible to com-
municate with the electronic control units 
using a diagnostic tester connected to the 
bus by a diagnosis connector.

Different addressing methods exist: 
 normal and extended addressing, whereby 
normal addressing is the regular address-
ing method and is analyzed below. Longer 
messages that do not fit into a CAN frame 
(seven bytes with normal addressing, six 
with extended addressing) are segmented 
into several CAN frames and recomposed 
by the recipient.

Unsegmented messages
If the quantity of data bytes to be transmit-
ted is no greater than seven bytes (for nor-
mal addressing), a single frame is trans-
ferred. The first byte to be sent is the PCI 
(Protocol Control Information). It identi-
fies the frame in the high nibble (top four 
bits of a byte) as being a single frame and 
indicates the data length (DL) in the low 
nibble (Fig. 9).

The data is sent by the transmitter to the 

receiver in a single message (Fig. 10a).

Baud rates
The typical baud rates associated with 
CAN are 500 kBd or 1 MBd.

Addressing and message types
Tester communication on the CAN bus  
is defined by ISO 15765. The communica-
tion services of ISO 15765-3 or 14 229-1 
are defined in a similar way to those of 
ISO 14230-3 (Fig. 2). 

The fundamental difference between 
these protocols is in the format of mes-
sages and how they are transmitted. While 
up to 255 data bytes can be transmitted in 
a message on the K line, only eight data 
bytes are possible with the CAN. To repro-
duce the service messages on the CAN, the 
contents (data bytes) of the header and the 
checksum are separated and embedded in 
a similar, new message format. The ad-
dress of the electronic control unit is now 
the CAN identifier itself. With different 
CAN identifiers, it is now possible to sup-
port functional or physical addressing.

Segmented messages
If more than seven data bytes (for normal 
addressing) are to be delivered, the diag-
nosis tester (client) sends a first frame  
on the CAN data bus (Fig. 10b) first of all. 
The electronic control unit (server) ac-
knowledges with a flow-control frame.  
The other data is subsequently sent in 
 consecutive frames.

The first frame contains the PCI, an ad-

the first six data bytes (Fig. 11). In the 
high nibble, the PCI contains the informa-
tion for identifying the frames as the first 
frame. The extended data length (XDL) 
is stored in the low nibble. Together with 
the DL, a 12-bit data word is formed with 
which it is possible to express values from 
0 to 4,095. 

The transmitter sends the first frame 
and waits for an acknowledgment of re-
ceipt from the receiver in the form of a 
flow-control frame. This message again 
contains the PCI, the high nibble of which 
identifies the frame as the flow-control 
frame. The low nibble contains the flow 
status (FS), which can be used to authorize 
or delay the sending of further frames 
(consecutive frames).

BlockSize (BS) indicates how many consec-
utive frames can be received without the 
need for a further flow-control frame to  
be sent. The values expressed in STmin

The flow-control frame is followed by 
the consecutive frames. Again, the PCI  
in the high nibble contains the identifier, 
while the low nibble contains the sequence 
number (SN). With the first consecutive 
frame to be sent, the SN is set to 1. The SN 
is incremented with each subsequent con-
secutive frame; after 15, the SN restarts 
from 0. By evaluating the sequence num-
ber, the receiver is able to detect whether 
or not all the frames have arrived.

Architecture of electronic systems

Over the last three decades, tremendous 
progress has been made in automotive 
engineering. Modern injection and ex-
haust-gas treatment systems drastically 
reduced pollutants in the exhaust gas, 
while occupant-protection and vehicle 
stabilization systems improved safety  
on the road. Much of this success is due 
to the introduction of electronically-con-
trolled systems. The proportion of these 
systems used in cars increased continu-
ously. The requirements of safety and 
 environmental compatibility, but also  
the demand for comfort and convenience 
functions, will increase yet further and 
this will in no small part be achieved 
through the use of electronics. Up to 
around 90 % of innovations in the motor 
vehicle will be realized by electronics 
and microprocessor-controlled systems. 
The networking of these electronics cre-
ates the prerequisite for having this wide 
variety of electronic systems integrated 
within the complete vehicle system to 
form a whole. However, this results in  
a complexity that can only be overcome 
at considerable expense.

Overview

History
The on-board electrical network of a car 
around the year 1950 comprised approx. 
40 lines. Essentially, cables were only re-
quired for the battery, starter, ignition and 
the lighting and signaling systems. 

With the first electronic injection and 
 ignition systems, cabling complexity began 
to increase fast. Sensors fitted in the en-
gine compartment (e.g. speed sensor, 
 engine-temperature sensor) had to deliver 
signals to the engine control unit, while 
the fuel injectors required their triggering 
signals from the electronic control unit. 

A further increase in cabling complexity 

resulted from the introduction and rapid 
widespread adoption of the antilock brake 
system (ABS). Meanwhile, comfort and 
convenience systems, e.g. electrical power-
window units, would also form part of the 
standard equipment. All these systems re-
quire additional connecting lines for the 
connection of sensors, control elements 
and actuators to the control unit.

Technology of the present day
In the 1990s the cabling work in a luxury 
class vehicle amounted to around 3 km. 
This figure clearly demonstrates how 
 complex the vehicle system has become. 
The growth of the proportion of electron-
ics in the motor vehicle (Fig. 1) can mainly 
be attributed to the growth in microelec-
tronics and sensor technology. 

At first, many of the new systems were 

integrated into the vehicle by means of 
their own dedicated electronic control 
unit. For the most part, the individual 
 electronic control units operated in mutual 
independence. All the same, connecting 
lines became increasingly necessary be-
tween electronic control units to enable 
the exchange of data by means of PWM 
signals, for example. Depending on the 
 vehicle class, there are between 20 and  
80 electronic control units fitted in today’s 
vehicles. They control such equipment as 
the engine, antilock brake system or the 
airbags. The number of microcontrollers 
in the vehicle has therefore risen continu-
ously in recent years (Fig. 2).

The components of the individual sys-
tems are optimally matched to each other. 
The systems may originate from different 
manufacturers that use previously agreed, 
albeit still their own, interfaces. The rain 
sensor, for example, “speaks” in a different 
way to the sensors for the engine manage-
ment. The following example demon-
strates just how networked the functions 
in a modern vehicle are: the radar sensor 
of the adaptive cruise control system 
(ACC) measures the distance to the vehicle 
traveling in front. If this distance is shorter 
than a specified minimum distance, the 
ACC electronic control unit sends this in-
formation to the engine management, the 
ESP electronic control unit and the airbag 
electronic control unit. The engine man-
agement reduces torque and thus driving 
speed. If this is not sufficient, the elec-
tronic stability program (ESP) must also 
generate brake pressure to decelerate  
the vehicle. If the distance continues to 

shorten, the airbag and seat-belt preten-
sioners are set to emergency standby.
The communication between the elec-
tronic control units cannot take more than 
fractions of a second. The more electronic 
control units interact in the one complete 
system, the more difficult it becomes for 
them to communicate undisturbed.

With the number of electronic control 
units and the associated need for mutual 
communication, the costs of developing 
the systems rose as did the adaptation 
costs for making interfaces compatible. 
With the CAN bus (Controller Area Net-
work) developed by Bosch, a powerful and 
widely used data bus system has become 
commonplace in vehicles for the first time. 
The data line of the CAN bus makes it pos-
sible for the electronic control units to 
 exchange specific and relevant items of 
 information with each other. At the start,  
the network only comprised a few elec-
tronic control units, such as the engine-
management system, the electronic stabil-
ity program and the transmission control. 
Gradually, further systems would expand 
this network, especially in the areas of 
comfort and convenience and infotain-
ment. The CAN bus has gradually evolved 
into the standard for networking systems 
in the motor vehicle. Today it is the stan-
dard for communication between elec-

tronic control units within different areas 
of the electronics (drivetrain, suspension, 
body electronics and infotainment) and 
forms a powerful backbone for networking 
these areas with each other. Additional bus 
systems (e.g. LIN bus, MOST bus) are used 
as subbuses or for transmitting at high 
data rates with comparatively low realtime 
requirements in the motor vehicle.

Development trends
The proportion of electrics and electronics 
in the motor vehicle will continue to in-
crease. In the drivetrain, the number of 
components in the exhaust line (e.g. ex-
haust-gas sensors) is increasing due to 
stricter exhaust-emissions legislation. 
While the demands for reductions in fuel 
consumption can, for example, be fulfilled 
by means of new valve-gear concepts, even 
this requires additional electronic compo-
nents. A further increase in the proportion 
of electronics results mainly from the 
growth of electronic systems in the areas 
of safety, comfort and convenience, and 
 infotainment. 

Objectives
Drivers demand a high level of reliability 
from a car. The vehicle manufacturer and 
the supplier of assemblies, meanwhile,  
are constrained by other requirements 
such as minimization of manufacturing 
costs, space restrictions and the weight  
of components. An opportunity to fulfill 
these requirements in the face of the in-
creasing complexity of the “vehicle” sys-
tem is seen in the shift of the traditional 
implementation technologies of mechan-
ics, hydraulics and electrics towards 
 microprocessor-controlled, electronic 
 systems. For this reason, the development 
of software will continue to gain in impor-
tance in future.

The current situation in the electrical 
and electronic architecture of motor vehi-
cles is characterized by an increase in 
functionality and an increasingly strained 
costs situation. To achieve both of these 

objectives simultaneously, development 
partners are more frequently tapping into 
resources that are already available in sub-
systems. These can be sensors or actuators 
as well as realized functions that are avail-
able to different systems over the commu-
nications network. For new systems and 
functions, manufacturers strive to get by 
on a minimum of additional resources.  
In the meantime, engineers are faced with 
a new challenge in the form of "networked" 
thinking and subsystem integration, espe-
cially when the assemblies for the subsys-
tems originate from different development 
partners (suppliers).

Complaints in the field (i.e. with series-
production vehicles) due to electrical or 
electronic failures could be the conse-
quence of not having taken the interac-
tions of the subsystems into consideration. 
The causes – unmanageable behavior of 
functionality spread among networked 
systems, and their integration – are avoid-
able through the logical application of cer-
tified development processes as early as  
in the specification phase. Furthermore, 
modeling and tools for authoring a formal 
description of architectures are gaining 
ever more in importance.

Broadened requirements for a complete 
motor vehicle system in the future are 
leading to increased networking of vehicle 
components and subsystems. In this re-
gard, new functions are being developed 
that go beyond the frontiers of traditional 
applications – and this is without addi-
tional expenditure on hardware wherever 
possible.

New development methods and technol-
ogies are required to make this achievable. 
With a top-down approach, new functions 
are viewed from the perspective of the 
complete vehicle. This means that, in ac-
cordance with the method of systems engi-
neering, functional requirements and non-
functional requirements (e.g. quality ob-
jectives, safety, costs, etc.) are set for the 
vehicle as a whole and derived as specifi-

Architecture of electronic systems  |  Overview  |  155

cations for the subordinate subsystems. 
These requirements are formulated as a 
model and can thus be used as a specifica-
tion for the subsystems and the creation  
of test cases. This is what is known as an 
“executable specification”, which makes  
it possible to prove the completeness and 
the traceability of the requirements, for 
example, or to identify the requirements 
for interaction and communication be-
tween subsystems. In this way, it is possi-
ble to form an optimized architecture for 
the complete vehicle and its subsystems 
and components. The functional relation-
ships between the complete motor vehicle 
system and the subordinate subsystems 
can be surveyed in different levels of detail 
and suitable interfaces can be defined for 
the functions. This approach supports an 
expanding networking of functions. Syner-
gies are exploited between vehicle areas 
(domains such as the drivetrain, interior, 
infotainment) that were hitherto consid-
ered in isolation and resources are spared. 
As an element of the development pro-
cess that works in the opposite direction, 
the generation of new functions from avail-
able resources and existing systems (bot-
tom up) should also be taken into consid-
eration to minimize innovation risks.  
This is how new functions are integrated 
into existing systems, for example. Exam-
ples of this approach are measures to avert 
the consequences of an accident by “pre-
paring” subsystems for an imminent crash 
(closing windows, closing the sliding sun-
roof, activating the airbag, etc.) or the as-
sistance of the driver in emergency brak-
ing situations in ESP in future. In this way, 
it is possible to reduce the number of elec-
tronic control units and counteract rising 
system costs.

The development process described 
characterizes the CARTRONIC® concept 
that Bosch developed in the 1980s.  
The  results of this concept are being 
 incorporated into the Autosar Initiative 
(see Autosar Initiative)

Vehicle system architecture

Architecture
The architecture of a system represents  
its “construction plan”. It describes the 
structural and dynamic system character-
istics as a whole. The architecture is usu-
ally specified in a description language. 
Special draft mechanisms are used for 
 specific requirements. With architecture 
being a construction plan for different 
 realization technologies and a means of 
proving that functional and nonfunctional 
requirements have been fulfilled in the 
system draft, different views of the system 
architecture are required. Examples of this 
include: 
 ▶ Hardware architecture 
 ▶ Software architecture 
 ▶ Network architecture in the area of real-

ization technologies

 ▶ Cost and resource consumption in the 

area of economical analysis and
 ▶ For the area of social requirements, 

 aspects such as safety, availability and 
legal conformity

The problems that arise in the integration 
of differently structured subsystems can 
be reduced by means of an architecture.

Functional structure 
The domain of vehicle motion has the task 
of ensuring the controlled movement of 
the vehicle as well as its directional stabil-
ity. This task can be subdivided into vari-
ous levels (Fig. 3). 

The navigation level is home to the plan-
ning tools for the driving route. These are 
merely informational in nature and have 
no interventional influence on vehicle 
 motion. 

At vehicle guidance level, the decisions 
of the driver are implemented by means of 
the steering wheel and accelerator pedal 
but also various assistance systems for ve-
hicle handling (e.g. ACC, course stability 

156  |  Architecture of electronic systems  |  Vehicle system architecture

systems). At this level, the driver is able  
to overrule the assistance systems at any 
time. 

At the stability level, there are the sub-
systems that are able to correct the deci-
sions taken at handling level if these hap-
pen to be outside the range of safe refer-
ence variables (e.g. ABS, ESP). This may  
be the case when cornering or on wet road 
surfaces, for example. 

At stabilization level, correcting vari-
ables for implementation by the vehicle’s 
actuators are determined. Information 
about the environment (e.g. road condi-
tion, air temperature, rain sensor signal)  
is still required at the various levels for  
the implementation of the relevant tasks.
These tasks can be assigned to func-
tional components, which are the architec-
tural elements of the functional architec-
ture. In this way, the driver information 

functional component represents the tasks 
of the navigation level, which are to inform 
the driver of the driving route determined 
by means of a mapping system (Fig. 3). 
 Vehicle guidance represents the guidance 
level, and stability intervention the tasks 
of the stabilization level. The vehicle mo-
tion coordinator determines the correcting 
variables for the actuators, e.g. of the  
drive and electronic stability program 
(ESP), from the information input by 
 vehicle guidance and stability interven-
tion.

Figure 4 shows how the functional com-

ponents of guidance level, stabilization 
level and vehicle actuators are related in  
a hierarchical structure within vehicle 
 motion. Communication relationships 
 between the components and interactions 
with other domains, e.g. body and interior, 
are also featured in the model.

In the same way as Vehicle motion is 
 refined, these functional components 
 require further detailing until the refined 
components represent manageable, 
clearly delimited tasks that make flexible, 
modular implementation possible through 
different realization technologies. Defined 
interfaces between the components enable 
communication and the exchange of data. 
For example, the transmission control 
 issues a request through the engine-man-
agement system for a specific reduction  
in torque during a gearshift. This value is 
exchanged as a physical variable via the 
interface.

With its integration into a suitable pro-
cedural model, the functional structure is 
the starting point for subsequent stages in 
the development process.

Systematic creation of EE system 
architectures
The increasing amount of networking in 
traditional vehicle domains for the realiza-
tion of new functions can be illustrated 
 using the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) 
driver-assistance system as an example. 
Adaptive, same-lane driving is made possi-
ble by the networking of a combined 
cruise and distance control system with 
the engine-management system, brake sys-
tem, transmission and cockpit. Here, sub-
systems from the drivetrain, chassis and 
infotainment (interaction with the driver) 
domains are used to realize the new func-
tion with minimal cost.

The decision as to whether a function  
(e.g. ACC) is realized in a dedicated logic 
close to the sensor or in one of the exist-
ing, subscriber electronic control units  
has no bearing on the function itself.

Rather, the decision is affected by non-
functional requirements such as safety, 
availability, costs or resource availability. 
In addition to the functional requirements, 
these  requirements mainly determine how  
the function is realized. The “how” is de-
scribed by the architecture of the system. 
Different requirements result in different 
system architectures.

ization stages. This required a decoupled 
development process and the exploitation 
of synergies between subsystems. The de-
velopment frameworks took into consider-
ation the dependencies and interface con-
tents within the individual domains and 
with the rest of the vehicle, as is the case 
with a networked system such as ACC,  
for example.

CARTRONIC® concept
With the CARTRONIC® architecture con-
cept, all closed and open-loop control 
tasks in the vehicle have been structured 
in accordance with logical, functional 
viewpoints and modeled in the form of  
a functional architecture. Delimited func-
tions (and their dependencies) that imple-
ment specific functional requirements 
have been represented by defined archi-
tectural elements. The functional struc-
ture, i.e. the structural description, repre-
sented a hierarchical decomposition of  
the subsystems down to manageable size. 
Interactions between elements of the func-
tional structure have been described by 
communication relationships. Since the 
use of the architecture concept could have 
led to different functional structures,  
it was essential to reach agreement on  
the tasks and interfaces. It was necessary 
to choose interfaces that were based on 
physical variables and thus supported 
 aspects such as reusability and inter-
changeability. 

The motor vehicle system with all its open 
and closed-loop tasks was dismantled into 
subsystems that implement clearly defined 
tasks. These subsystems include the en-
gine management, brake system, transmis-
sion control, ACC, lighting management, 
etc. Different levels of functional structure 
detail can be assigned to the system and 
subsystem levels (Fig. 5). It was therefore 
possible to create development frame-
works for selected functional components 
and component groups on which to base 
implementation in the form of partial real-

Bosch introduced this concept to the Auto-
sar Initiative (Workpackage 10.x).

Software architecture 
The independence of the functional struc-
ture, or architecture, from the later real-
ization stage results in a decoupling of 
functionality and technology and thus 
forms the first stage of a model-based 
 development process. The functional 
structure can be used on several occasions 
and expanded as the foundation for draft-
ing system architectures. This architecture 
is characterized by architecture drivers 
(specific criteria of the architecture) that 
are essentially the product of nonfunc-
tional requirements (e.g. costs, quality, 
 reusability, relocatability).

Further precision of the development 
frameworks devised from the functional 
structure, and of their interfaces in partic-
ular, is required if it is to be possible to 
evaluate an electronic control unit for the 
relocatability of functions and the integra-
tion of software, which is a contribution  
of various participants in the project. 
While retaining the realization-indepen-
dent information from the functional 
structure – such as an agreed torque inter-
face – the frameworks are supplemented 
by realization-specific information such  
as data type, quantization, runtime prop-
erties or resource requirements.

In the same way as hardware and disci-
plines such as mechanics or hydraulics, 
software can also be classified as a realiza-
tion technology. Product-line or platform 
approaches have long been a familiar 

Architecture of electronic systems  |  Vehicle system architecture  |  159

 feature of mechanical development or pro-
duction optimization and their application 
is virtually universal. The trend towards 
software-based system solutions and im-
provements, in conjunction with the vastly 
expanding software scopes of electronic 
systems, has given rise to the demand for 
this strategy to also be transferred to soft-
ware-intensive systems.

The decisive challenge faced today is 
less to do with technical feasibility but 
more about how to develop methods fur-
ther and apply already developed methods 
and processes in product developments  
in a systematic and disciplined way, and  
to anchor them within the organization. 
The product-line approach in software de-
velopment was transferred to the motor 
vehicle domain with the participation of 
Bosch with methodological support from 
the software engineering institute (SEI). 
The method will be used systematically  
in future Bosch product generations.

Network architecture
With the spreading of open standards  
such as the CAN bus, the integration of 
functions into application-specific elec-
tronic control units, and satellites linked 
by subnetworks, network architecture has 
become the synonym for the complexity 
management of distributed systems. 
 Extensions and “attachment solutions”  
are easily integrated until the limits of 
 network capacity are reached. If these 
possibilities were to be exploited without 
checking the system draft, this would 
 result in unmanageable increases in com-
plexities and integration conflicts. Biologi-
cal systems solve these unmanageable 
complexities through specialization and 
the creation of subnetworks with new 
forms of organization. Their objectives  
are stability and the ability to survive.  
This model has, to a certain extent, 
evolved on its own in motor vehicle sys-
tems through assignment to traditional

fields of application or domains and the 
comparatively slow growth of networking 
within these domains.

Bus systems for the individual domains are 
becoming more specialized due to their 
plainly different requirements. With the 
CAN in the drivetrain as the point of ori-
gin, new bus systems such as the LIN sub-
bus have begun to infiltrate the area of 
body electronics or FlexRay in the case of 
safety-relevant x-by-wire systems. In the 
multimedia field, where demands for high 
data rates but low safety requirements 
prevail, bus systems such as Bluetooth 
have started to make an appearance.

Breaking through these traditional do-
mains with ever more applications leads  
to known consequences, e.g. dramatic in-
crease in complexity, high start-up costs, 
increasing integration times and costs, and 
more demanding work in customer service 
as a consequence of diagnostics no longer 
being manageable. A solution for these 
multidimensional optimization tasks has in 
the past been sought in the software field. 
In the case of technical systems in particu-
lar, the paradigm is still king, especially in 
software realizations, because the absence 
of physical boundaries supports unlimited 
growth.

Autosar Initiative
The Autosar Initiative (AUTomotive Open 
Systems ARchitecture) was founded in  
July 2003 by several vehicle manufacturers 
and suppliers – Bosch among them. Their 
global objective is the joint development  
of an open system architecture for future 
automotive applications. The aims of the 
partnership include the standardization  
of fundamental system functions (basic 
software) and function interfaces; they  
will replace the company-specific, individ-
ual solutions used to date. Model-based 
concepts and methods ought to reduce 
complexity in spite of an expanding range 
of functions. The demands for quality and 
reliability are fulfilled by the multiple use 

of proven standards. Autosar concerns 
 itself with all vehicle domains. 

Based on the uniform electronics plat-
form, which primarily consists of standard 
software modules, each vehicle manufac-
turer is then free to build its own specific 
content. They enable integration into the 
electronics network. These software func-
tions permit differentiation between the 
competition.

Not only does software have to conform 

to the Autosar standard. The electronic 
control units must be built in such a way 
that the Autosar software is able to run on 
them. The Autosar members are hoping 
that the new development methods yield 
such benefits as shorter development 
times and lower development costs. 

Until now, it was often the case that dedi-
cated electronic control units would be 
 developed and fitted for new functions  
(e.g. electronic transmission control, 
 antilock brake system, air conditioning). 
The number of electronic control units 
 fitted in the vehicle grew continuously; 
 today’s generation of vehicles are 
equipped with between 20 and 80 elec-
tronic control units. In future vehicle gen-
erations, it is intended that all functions  
be covered by a network of 10 to 20 elec-
tronic control units. Some of these will 
function a little like main computers that 
will bundle the important function groups 
together. These include the drivetrain, 
 suspension management system, body  
and interior and the multimedia/telematics 
domain. On data buses, sensors with inte-
grated electronics output processed and 
verified signals, while the buses carry the 
relevant control commands to actuators 
with integrated triggering electronics.

In future, new functions will often be 
able to use the existing computer architec-
ture up to its performance limit and will  
be widely realized in the form of a soft-
ware add-on. This would therefore render 
unnecessary the additional electronic con-
trol unit that would have been required  

Architecture of electronic systems  |  Vehicle system architecture  |  161

Outlook
Increasingly greater demands for safety, 
reliability and availability are being placed 
on the network architecture of modern 
 vehicles. This is where energy network 
 architecture will play a key role. In the  
face of vehicle functions increasingly be-
ing realized electronically, this architec-
ture makes for a reliable supply of power 
to systems and thus forms the basis for  
the reliability and safety of future systems. 
One possible future technology is the 
transmission of power and information  
on the supply line. The following benefits 
arise from the powerline communication 
(PLC) concept used in the public grid:
 ▶ Weight and cost reductions as well as 

space savings from the discontinuation 
of data lines

 ▶ Easier retrofitting for retrofit systems 

(spare parts trade)

 ▶ Reduction in complexity of the wiring 
harness in respect of manufacture and 
installation

 ▶ Increase in system safety, especially in 
mechanically stressed zones (e.g. door, 
mirror) that are characterized by pre-
mature aging of lines and increased risk 
of failure

 ▶ Powerline as a redundancy path for sys-

tems relevant to safety 

 ▶ Simultaneous, or parallel, implementa-
tion of several bus systems or services, 
e.g. diagnostics

today. The system only needs to be supple-
mented by the sensors and actuators re-
quired.

Software will no longer be an inevitable 
component of hardware, but will increas-
ingly become a stand-alone product.  
The first examples of business and col-
laborative models between supplier and 
manufacturer have already been put into 
practice at Bosch, e.g. in drivetrain man-
agement. 

Examples
Individually-controlled drive components 
at each of the wheels with different wheel 
positions and wheel loads permit optimum 
use of tire force potential. This results in 
increased driving dynamics and safety 
while at the same time reducing consump-
tion, wear and emissions. For this to be 
possible, all active elements in the drive-
train, suspension and steering must be 
networked.

One example of superordinate functions 
realized by networking is the ASIS (Active 
Shift Strategy) drive strategy for automatic 
transmissions in passenger cars. Based on 
the evaluation of various control elements 
(e.g. accelerator pedal) and conclusions 
drawn from the information of other sys-
tems (e.g. cornering detection from the 
wheel speeds), this strategy is able to con-
trol the gearshift in such a way as to meet 
the driver’s real-time demand for agility 
and power through selection of the appro-
priate gear. In future, the telematics will  
be able to support additional, improved 
driving strategies, e.g. through the use  
of GPS signals for transmission control  
in terms of predictive driving.

Mechatronics

The term “mechatronics” came about as 
a made-up word from mechanics and 
electronics, where electronics means 
“hardware” and “software”, and mechan-
ics is the generic term for the disciplines 
of “mechanical engineering” and “hy-
draulics”. It is not a question of replacing 
mechanical engineering by “electronifi-
cation”, but of a synergistic approach 
and design methodology. The aim is to 
achieve a synergistic optimization of me-
chanical engineering, electronic hard-
ware and software in order to project 
more functions at lower cost, less weight 
and installation space, and better quality. 
The successful use of mechatronics in a 
problem solution is dependent upon an 
overall examination of disciplines that 
were previously kept separate. 

1 Mechatronic system

Mechatronic systems  
and components 

Applications
Mechatronic systems and components are 
now present throughout almost the entire 
vehicle: starting with engine-management 
systems and injection systems for gasoline 
and diesel engines to transmission control 
systems, electrical and thermal energy 
management systems, through to a wide 
variety of brake and driving dynamics sys-
tems. It even includes communication and 
information systems, with many different 
requirements when it comes to operability. 
Besides systems and components, mecha-
tronics are also playing an increasingly 
 vital role in the field of micromechanics.

Examples at system level
A general trend is emerging in the further 
development of systems for fully automatic 
vehicle handling and steering: more and 
more mechanical systems will be replaced 
by “X-by-wire” systems in future.

A system that was implemented long ago is 
the “Drive-by-wire” system, i.e. electronic 
throttle control. 

“Brake-by-wire” replaces the hydrome-
chanical connection between the brake 
pedal and the wheel brake. Sensors record 
the driver’s braking request and transmit 
this information to an electronic control 
unit. The unit then generates the required 
braking effect at the wheels by means of 
actuators. 

One implementation option for  

“Brake-by-wire” is the electrohydraulic 
brake (SBC, Sensotronic Brake Control). 
When the brake is operated or in the event 
of brake stabilization intervention by the 
electronic stability program (ESP), the SBC 
electronic control unit calculates the re-
quired brake pressure setpoints at the in-
dividual wheels. Since the unit calculates 
the required braking pressures separately 
for each wheel and collects the actual val-
ues separately, it can also regulate the 
brake pressure to each wheel via the 
wheel-pressure modulators. The four 
pressure modulators each consist of an 
 inlet and an outlet valve controlled by 
electronic output stages which together 
produce a finely metered pressure reg-
ulation.

Pressure generation and injection are 
 decoupled in the Common Rail System.  
A high-pressure rail, i.e. the common rail, 
serves as a high-pressure accumulator, 
constantly providing the fuel pressure re-
quired for each of the engine’s operating 
states. A solenoid-controlled injector with 
a built-in injection nozzle injects fuel di-
rectly into the combustion chamber for 
each cylinder. The engine electronics re-
quest data on accelerator pedal position, 
rotational speed, operating temperature, 
fresh-air intake flow, and rail pressure in 
order to optimize the control of fuel me-
tering as a function of the operating condi-
tions. 

Examples at component level
Fuel injectors are crucial components in 
determining the future potential of Diesel-
engine technology. Common-rail injectors 
are an excellent example of the fact that an 
extremely high degree of functionality 
and, ultimately, customer utility can only 
be achieved by controlling all the physical 
domains (electrodynamics, mechanical en-
gineering, fluid dynamics) to which these 
components are subjected.

In-vehicle CD drives are exposed to partic-
ularly tough conditions. Apart from wide 
temperature ranges, they must in particu-
lar withstand vibrations that have a critical 
impact on such precision-engineered sys-
tems. 

In order to keep vehicle vibration away 

from the actual player during mobile de-
ployment, the drives normally have a 
spring damping system. Considerations 
about reducing the weight and installation 
space of CD drives immediately raise ques-
tions concerning these spring-damper sys-
tems. In CD drives without a damper sys-
tem, the emphasis is on designing a me-
chanical system with zero clearances and 
producing additional reinforcement for 
the focus and tracking controllers at high 
frequencies. 

Only by combining both measures 
 mechatronically is it possible to achieve 
good vibration resistance in driving  
mode. As well as reducing the weight by 
approx. 15 %, the overall height is also 
 reduced by approx. 20 %.

The new mechatronic system for electri-
cally operated refrigerant motors is based 
on brushless, electronically commutated 
DC motors (BLDC’s). Initially, they are 
more expensive (motor with electronics) 
than previous DC motors equipped with 
brushes. However, the overall optimization 
approach brings benefits: BLDC motors 
can be used as “wet rotors” with a much 
simpler design. The number of separate 
parts is therefore reduced by approx. 60 %. 

164  |  Mechatronics  |  Mechatronic systems and components

In terms of comparable cost, this more 
 robust design doubles the service life, 
 reduces the weight by almost half and 
 reduces the overall length by approx. 40 %. 

Examples in the field of micromechanics
Another application for mechatronics is 
the area of micromechanical sensor sys-
tems, with noteworthy examples such as 
hot-film air-mass meters and yaw-rate 
 sensors. 

Because the subsystems are so closely 

coupled, microsystems design also re-
quires an interdisciplinary procedure that 
takes the individual disciplines of mechan-
ical components, electrostatics and possi-
bly fluid dynamics and electronics into 
consideration. 

Development methods

Simulation
The special challenges that designers face 
when developing mechatronic systems are 
the ever shorter development times and 
the increasing complexity of the systems. 
At the same time, it is vital to ensure that 
the developments will result in useful 
products.

Complex mechatronic systems consist of  
a large number of components from differ-
ent physical domains: hydraulic compo-
nents, mechanical components and elec-
tronic components. The interaction be-
tween these domains is a decisive factor 
governing the function and performance 
of the overall system. Simulation models 
are required to review key design deci-
sions, especially in the early development 
stages when there is no prototype avail-
able.

Mechatronics  |  Development methods  |  165

However, an analysis of the typical compo-
nents in mechatronic systems shows that 
they can be composed of a few simple ele-
ments specific to the domains. These stan-
dard elements are, for example: 
▶  In the hydraulic system: throttle, valve 

▶  In the electronic system: resistor, capac-

or electric line 

itor or transistor 

▶  In the mechanical system: ground with 
friction, transmission or clutch (or the 
equivalent for micromechanics)

The preferable solution is that these ele-
ments should be stored in a central stan-
dard model library that is also decentrally 
accessible to product development. The 
essence of the standard model library is  
a documentation of all the standard ele-
ments. For each element, this comprises: 
▶  Description of physical behavior in 

▶  The physical equations, parameters 
(e.g. conductivity or permeability),  
state variables (e.g. current, voltage, 
magnetic flux, pressure) and 

▶  The description of the associated inter-

words

faces 

In addition, a major part of the environ-
ment is a reference model written in a 
modeling language that is independent  
of the tool. Overall, the library includes 
reference models from the mechanical, 
 hydraulic, electronic, electrodynamic  
and software areas.

Basic issues can often be clarified by pro-
ducing relatively simple models of the 
components. If more detail is required, 
more refined component models are 
needed. The detailed models focus mainly 
on a specific physical domain:
▶  This means that detailed hydraulic mod-
els of common rail injectors are avail-
able, for example. These can be simu-
lated using special programs with nu-
meric calculation methods that are 
exactly tailored to hydraulic systems. 
Cavitation phenomena have to be taken 
into consideration, among other things.
▶  Detailed models are also needed to de-
sign the power electronics that trigger 
the injector. Again, this involves the use 
of simulation tools which must be devel-
oped specifically to design electronic 
circuits.

▶  The development and simulation of the 

software that controls the high-pressure 
pump and the power electronics in the 
control unit with the aid of the sensor 
signals also takes place using tools that 
are specially designed for this area of 
the overall system.

As the components in the overall system 
interact with each other, it is not sufficient 
to consider specific detailed models of the 
components in isolation. The optimum so-
lution is also to take into account the mod-
els of other system components. In most 
cases, these components can be repre-
sented by simpler models. For example, 
the system simulation that is focussed on 
the hydraulic components only requires  
a simple model of the power electronics.

The application of various domain-specific 
simulation tools during the development 
of mechatronic systems is only efficient if 
there is some sort of support for exchang-
ing models and parameters between the 
simulation tools. The direct exchange of 
models is highly problematic due to the 
specific languages used for describing the 
models of each of the tools.

166  |  Mechatronics  |  Development methods

V model
The dependencies of the different product 
development phases are illustrated in the 
“V model”: from requirement analysis to 
development, implementation, testing and 
system deployment. A project passes 
through three “top-down” levels during 
the development stage:
▶  Customer-specific functions 
▶  Systems and 
▶  Components

A requirements specification (what) must 
first be produced at each level in the form 
of specifications. This results in the design 
specification, which is drawn up on the ba-
sis of design decisions (the actual creative 
engineering work). The performance spec-
ifications describe how a requirement can 
be met. The performance specs form the 
basis for a model description which allows 
a review (i.e. validation) of the correctness 
of each design stage together with previ-
ously defined test cases. This procedure 

passes through each of three stages, and, 
depending on the technologies applied, for 
each of the associated domains (mechani-
cal engineering, hydraulics, fluid dynam-
ics, electrics, electronics, and software).

Recursions at each of the design levels 
shorten the development stages signifi-
cantly. Simulations, rapid prototyping, and 
simultaneous engineering are tools that al-
low rapid verification, and they create the 
conditions for shortening product cycles.

Outlook

The major driving force behind mecha-
tronics is continuous progress in the field 
of microelectronics. Mechatronics benefits 
from computer technology in the form of 
ever more powerful integrated computers 
in standard applications. Accordingly, 
there is a huge potential for further in-
creases in safety and convenience in  
motor vehicles, accompanied by further

reductions in exhaust emissions and fuel 
consumption. On the other hand, new 
challenges are emerging with regard to  
the technical mastery of these systems.
However, future “X-by-wire” systems 

without the mechanical/hydraulic fall-
back level must also provide the pre-
scribed functionality in the event of a 
problem. The condition for their imple-
mentation is a high-reliability and high-
availability mechatronic architecture 
which requires a “simple” proof of safety. 
This affects both single components as 
well as energy and signal transmissions. 

As well as “X-by-wire” systems, driver-as-
sistance systems and the associated man/
machine interfaces represent another area 
in which the consistent implementation of 
mechatronic systems could achieve signifi-
cant progress for both users and vehicle 
manufacturers. 

The design approaches of mechatronic 
systems should strive toward continuity  
in several aspects:
▶  Vertical: 
  “Top-down” from system simulation, 
with the objective of overall optimiza-
tion, through to finite element simula-
tion to achieve a detailed understanding, 
and “bottom-up” design engineering 
from component testing through to 
 system testing

▶  Horizontal: 
  “Simultaneous engineering” across 

 several disciplines in order to deal with 
all product-related aspects at the same 
time

▶  Beyond company boundaries: 
  Step by step, the idea a “virtual sample” 

is nearing our grasp

Another challenge is training in order to 
further an interdisciplinary mindset and 
develop suitable SE processes and forms  
of organization and communication.

168  |  Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Basic principles of semi conductor technology

Electronic components in the vehicle

Since the first electronic systems were 
introduced in the passenger car sector in 
the 1960s, the proportion of electronics 
in the motor vehicle has steadily risen. 
The first components to be used were 
predominantly discrete components. 
However, manufacturing costs and high 
requirements for system reliability soon 
inhibited their further development. 
Technological advances in microelec-
tronics promoted the increasingly dense 
integration of components. This gave  
rise to compact, dependable electronic 
systems for automotive applications.

Electronic systems in the motor vehicle 
make high engine output possible with low 
exhaust emissions and low fuel consump-
tion, they improve safety on the road and 
make for high levels of comfort and conve-
nience. The basis for these modern sys-
tems are the electronic components fitted 
in the electronic equipment concerned. 
They consist of a multitude of different 
passive and active components, the latter 
characterized by semiconductor compo-
nents.
 

Basic principles of semi-
conductor technology 

Electric conductivity
The specific suitability of different materi-
als for the conduction of electricity is de-
termined by the number and mobility of 
free charge carriers that they contain. The 
electric conductivity of solids at room tem-
perature has a range of 24 powers of ten. 
Solids are subdivided into three classes 

of material according to their electrical 
conductivity (Table 1).

ers is very large (one or two free electrons 
per atom). Their level of mobility is moder-

ate. Due to the high number of free elec-
trons, the electric conductivity of metals is 
high: good conductors have a conductivity 
of 106 siemens/cm.

Non-conductors (insulators)
In insulators, the number of free charge 
carriers is practically zero and conse-
quently the electric conductivity virtually 
non-existent. The conductivity of good in-
sulators is of the order of 10–18 siemens/cm.

Semiconductors
The electric conductivity of semiconduc-
tors is somewhere between that of conduc-
tors and insulators. Under normal condi-
tions, semiconductors also have a very 
small number of free charge carriers, but 
that number can be substantially increased 
by energy input from an external source. 
Their conductivity, therefore – in contrast 
to that of metals and insulators – is heavily 
dependent on:
▶  Pressure (affects the mobility of charge 

carriers)

▶  Temperature (affects the number and 

mobility of charge carriers)

▶  Exposure to light (affects the number of 

charge carriers) and

▶  Added impurities (doping, affects the 
number and type of charge carriers)

By doping the semiconductor material,  
it is possible to alter the properties of the 
semiconductor component in a specific 
manner. The sensitivity of semiconductors 
to pressure, temperature and light also 
makes them suitable for use as sensors.

Doping of semiconductor materials
The basis of semiconductor technology is 
the ability to accurately modify and local-
ize the conductivity of semiconductors by 
the controlled introduction of impurities 
that affect electrical properties (doping). 
The electric conductivity that can reliably 
be brought about in silicon by doping 
ranges from 104 to 10–2 siemens/cm.

As silicon is by far the most commonly 
used semiconductor material, the explana-
tions that follow will restrict themselves 
exclusively to that material. When solid, 
silicon consists of a crystal lattice in which 
each silicon atom is linked to four, equally 
spaced adjacent atoms. Every silicon atom 
has four outer electrons (Fig. 2). with two 
shared electrons forming the bond with 
the contiguous atoms. In this ideal state, 
silicon has no free charge carriers; thus 
it is not conductive. This condition is 
changed by the introduction of suitable 
 additives (doping), and energy input  
from an external source.

n-type doping
The addition of foreign atoms with five 
outer electrons (e.g. phosphorus) intro-
duces free electrons because only four  
are required to bind each atom within  
the silicon crystal lattice. Thus, each 
 additional phosphorus atom will provide  
a free, negatively charged electron.  
The silicon becomes n-conductive 
 (negatively conductive). It is then  
referred to as n-type silicon (Fig. 3).

p-type doping
The addition of foreign atoms with three 
outer electrons (e.g. boron) creates elec-
tron gaps. The boron atom is one electron 
short of the number required to properly 
bind it within the silicon crystal lattice. 
This gap in the bonding pattern is also 
called a hole.

4 p-n junction without external voltage

Holes are mobile in the silicon. In an 
 electrical field, they behave like positively-
charged charge carriers. They are able to 
drift by allowing the electrons of adjacent 
atoms to fill the gaps. It appears as if posi-
tive charge carriers are drifting through 
the silicon and positive current is flowing. 
Each boron atom introduced therefore 
supplies one free, positively charged hole. 
The silicon becomes positively conductive 
and is therefore referred to as p-type sili-
con (Fig. 3).

The conductivity of n-type silicon is 
around 10 times as high as that of p-type 
silicon assuming other factors are equal 
(e.g. number of foreign atoms, tempera-
ture, pressure) because electrons can 
move about 10 times as fast as holes.

Intrinsic conductivity
In response to external energy input,  
such as heat or incident light radiation, 
electrons may break free from the crystal 
structure. Conductivity, therefore, can 
even be generated in undoped silicon. 
Electron-hole pairs produce intrinsic con-
ductivity in the semiconductor. Such con-
ductivity is generally low compared with 
that produced by doping. Increases in tem-
perature induce an exponential rise in the

An n-type semiconductor always has some 
holes due to thermal fluctuations even at 
room temperature and a p-type semicon-
ductor always has some free electrons. 
Such minority charge carriers are funda-
mental to the way in which almost all 
 semiconductor components work,  
as will be demonstrated later.

p-n junction
The boundary between the p-type and n-
type regions of the same semiconductor 
crystal is called the p-n junction. Its prop-
erties are fundamental to almost all semi-
conductor components.

electrons (●). In the n-type region, by con-
trast, there are very few holes and a large 
number of free electrons. Due to the concen-
tration differentials, the mobile charge car-
riers in each region diffuse into the other 
 region in each case (diffusion currents).  
As a result, the p-type region is negatively 
charged and the n-type region positively 
charged. A potential difference (diffusion 
voltage) is created between the p-type re-
gion and the n-type region which counter-
acts migration of the charge carriers 
(Fig. 4b), ultimately bringing the exchange 
of holes and electrons to a halt. A region  
that is deficient in mobile charge carriers, 
and therefore has poor electric conductiv-
ity, is created at the p-n junction. It is re-
ferred to as the depletion layer or space-
charge  region. Due to the diffusion voltage, 
the  depletion layer has as strong electric 
field.

If an external voltage is applied to a  
p-n junction, it produces the effects 
 explained below (Fig. 5).

forced into the space-charge region.  
The depletion layer collapses. When the 
diffusion voltage is exceeded, the charge 
carriers flood the p-n junction and a large 
current flows in a forward direction.

Reverse direction
If the negative terminal is connected to  
the p-type region and the positive terminal 
to the n-type region, the width of the 
space-charge region increases. Conse-
quently,  current flow is largely inhibited 
apart from a very small residual current 
(reverse current) produced by minority 
charge carriers.

Breakdown voltage
Above a specific voltage in the reverse 
 direction (breakdown voltage), there is  
a sharp rise in reverse current.

The cause of this effect is the release of 
bound electrons from the crystal lattice in 
the space-charge region due to the high 
field strength (Zener breakdown) or due to 
surges of accelerated electrons. The accel-
erated electrons strike other electrons, 
breaking them free of their bonds and start-
ing an avalanche-like increase in the num-
ber of charge carriers (“avalanche break-
down” or “first breakdown”). Both effects 
are reversible. The nature of the break-
down and the level of the breakdown 
 voltage are dependent on the doping 
 concentration profile.

A second breakdown occurs if there  
is localized heating of a semiconductor 
component caused by current constriction 
so that the area concerned becomes more 
conductive. This results in a self-accelerat-
ing increase in current and leads to the 
 destruction of the semiconductor compo-
nent. The reason for this is the increasing 
intrinsic conductivity. Semiconductors 
have a very high positive temperature co-
efficient, i.e. on heating, their conductivity 
increases fast (exponentially). Due to the 
stronger flow of current, this produces 
even further heating (positive feedback).

Passive components

Ohmic resistors
Design 
Ohmic resistors are generally made of ma-
terials with conductive properties similar 
to metals, e.g. carbon (carbon-film resis-
tors) or special metal alloys (metal-film 
 resistors). Through the suitable selection 
of metal alloys, they are constructed so as 
to reduce to the absolute minimum the ef-
fect of voltage, current and temperature on 
their electrical resistance. The conductor 
has a very small cross-section relative to 
its length, this being achieved either by the 
application of thin films to insulators or by 
winding wire into a coil.

The resistor in a circuit is referred to by 
the symbol R and its unit of measurement 
is the ohm (Ω). 

Applications
In electronic circuits, resistors limit the 
current flow I or produce a voltage drop U 
proportional to the current. The resulting 
energy loss is converted into heat. Resis-
tors can be used, for example, to adjust  
the operating point of a transistor.

Capacitors
Design 
A capacitor comprises two metal plates 
that are electrically insulated from each 
other. If a negative voltage is applied  
to one of these plates, its electrons will 
gather together and it becomes negatively 
charged. Since like charges repel, the elec-
trons in the other plate are forced away 
and the plate becomes positively charged. 
The area and separation of the plates as 
well as the medium insulating them (di-
electric) determine the quantity of charge 
carriers that can be stored by the capacitor 
(its capacitance). Using a vacuum (or air) 
as the dielectric offers the lowest capaci-
tance. The capacitance can be substan-
tially increased by the use of other insulat-
ing materials. The ratio to capacitance 
with air as the dielectric is known as the 
relative dielectric constant «r. 

Since, in many cases, very large plates 
would be required for the commonly used 
capacitance values, capacitors are nor-
mally made by winding long strips into a 
coil (wound capacitors) or packing a large 
number of small plates together (multi-
layer capacitors). 

The electrolytic capacitor uses a  

thin layer of oxide as the dielectric. This 
method makes it possible to manufacture 
small capacitors with large capacitances.

This effect is utilized for triggering the 
airbag, for instance. Even if the wires con-
necting the airbag triggering unit to the 
vehicle’s battery are severed in a serious 
accident, the capacitor still holds suffi-
cient electrical energy to ensure that the 
airbag is deployed. In alternating-current 
circuits, a capacitor has a similar effect to 
a resistor.

In alternating-current circuits, the 
 capacitor is repeatedly charged and dis-
charged. A charge and discharge current 
therefore flows in permanent alternation. 
The current intensity depends on the ca-
pacity of the capacitor and the frequency 
of the alternating current. A capacitor 
therefore acts like a resistor, the resistance 
of which depends on capacity and fre-
quency. As the frequency decreases, the 
resistance increases. If the frequency is 
 reduced to its lowest limit, i.e. zero (direct 
current), the resistance is equal to infinity 
and, consequently, no current flow is pos-
sible. 

This relationship is utilized, for exam-

ple, by frequency filters in speaker sys-
tems in order to filter out high-frequency 
sounds from lower-frequency sounds 
(high-pass).

The capacitance in a circuit is referred to 
by the symbol C and its unit of measure-
ment is the farad (F).

Applications
If a DC voltage is applied to both plates, 
the capacitor stores up charge until the 
limit of its capacitance is reached (Fig. 2). 
A charging current I starts to flow that 
drops as the charge stored in the capacitor 
increases. No more current can flow once 
the capacitor is fully charged. Thus – for  
a certain period at least – the capacitor 
stores electrical energy that is then avail-
able even if the external power supply 
fails.

Coils 
When an electric current flows through  
a coil, a magnetic field is created. Its 
strength depends on the current intensity, 
the number of windings in the coil and  
the properties of the coil core (generally  
a ferrite or iron core). Inductance, as  
a characteristic of a coil, indicates the 
amount of magnetic energy the coil can 
store for a given current intensity. 

The magnetic field changes with a 
change in current intensity. A voltage is 
consequently induced in the coil which re-
sists the generation of the magnetic field 
(Lenz’s law). To clarify: if a DC voltage is 
applied to the coil, a current flows that 
generates a magnetic field. A change in 
magnetic field produces an induced volt-
age that is in the opposite direction to the 
applied DC voltage and thus resists the in-
crease in current. The current intensity in-
creases, but the increase becomes smaller 
and smaller. The change in magnetic flux 
and thus the induced voltage are also com-
mensurately reduced. The current seeks to 
achieve its maximum value as determined 
by the ohmic resistance of the coil wind-
ing. The magnetic field of the coil through 
which the direct current is flowing has 
then reached its maximum strength;  
no more voltage is induced due to the mag-
netic flux being constant. The coil does not 
therefore represent a lasting hindrance to 
the flow of direct current.

The inductance in a circuit is referred to 
by the symbol L and its unit of measure-
ment is the henry (H).

Applications
The generation of a magnetic field in a coil 
and the force that it exerts on a permanent 
magnet is used for applications such as 
fuel injectors. In the energized valve, the 
magnetic field causes the valve needle to 
lift away from its seat and allow the valve 
to exhaust gas.

In an alternating-current circuit, be-
cause of the constant generation and col-
lapse of the magnetic field (and the energy 
contained within it), the coil acts as a fre-
quency-dependent resistor, the character-
istics of which, however, are exactly the 
opposite of those of a capacitor. In this 
case, the higher the frequency, the greater 
is the resistance. This means that the coil 
can be used for frequency filters in loud-
speaker systems to filter out the low-fre-
quency sounds from the higher-frequency 
sounds (low-pass).

Semiconductor components

Semiconductor components are active 
components that are generally subdivided 
into four categories (Table 1). These cate-
gories are further subdivided according  
to the way in which the components are 
manufactured and their function. 

Discrete semiconductor components are 
stand-alone, “distinguishable” compo-
nents. According to the currently accepted 
definition, semiconductor components 
with fewer than 100 transistor functions 
are referred to as discrete.

Monolithic integrated circuits (ICs, Inte-
grated Circuits) are active components 
which incorporate more than 100 transis-
tors (monolithic literally meaning “made 
from a single stone” from the Greek 
“monolithos” meaning “single stone”).  

1 Semiconductor components (examples)

Discrete active components

– Semiconductor resistors

– Diodes

Micromechanical sensors (examples)

– Yaw rate/angular-position sensors

– Pressure sensors

– Acceleration sensors

– Flow sensors

– Temperature sensors

(Hall-effect sensors)

– Gas sensors

–  Position/angular-position sensors  

A complex electronic circuit is therefore 
integrated on a single, silicon chip.

Optoelectronic components emit or receive 
light. They are fundamentally different 
from the traditional active components in 
terms of their method of manufacture and 
usage. For example, most light emitting 
components (light emitting diodes, laser 
diodes) are not made of silicon, but from 
III/IV semiconductors (alloy made from 
semiconductor materials with three and 
five outer electrons, e.g. GaAs).

Micromechanical sensors contain mechani-
cal and electrical functions of sensors on  
a semiconductor chip (MST, MicroSystem 
Technology, or MEMS, MicroElectro-
Mechanical System). In this case too, the 
methods of production and the type of use 
differ substantially from conventional ac-
tive components. Normally, they are for 
the most part made from silicon but they 
contain some very complex, mechanical 
structures, e.g. “fingers”, that are free to 
oscillate and are thus suitable as a means 
of measuring acceleration. Pressure sen-
sors contain fine membranes that can be 
used to measure pressure differentials.

Diodes
Diodes are semiconductor components 
with a p-n junction and two electrical con-
nections – one to the p-type region and one 
to the n-type region. The pattern of doping 
impurity concentration within the crystal 
determines the specific characteristics of 
diodes. 

Diodes designed for a forward current  
of more than 1 A are referred to as power 
diodes.

Rectifier diode
A rectifier diode allows current to pass in 
one direction (positive terminal connected 
to p-type region) but not in the other (posi-
tive terminal connected to n-type region). 
It acts like a flow control valve and is suit-

Table 1

able for rectifying alternating current 
(Figs. 1a and 2). 

The current flowing in reverse direction 

(reverse current) is much smaller than  
the forward current (approx. 1/100 the 
strength). It rises rapidly in response to 
increases in temperature.  

Application: amongst other applications, 
rectifier diodes are used in automotive 
 alternators to convert the alternating 
 current into direct current. Because of the 
high ambient temperatures to which the 
alternator is subjected, the reverse current 
is a critical factor and has to be taken into 
account in the design of the diodes used.

Zener diode 
The Zener diode is a semiconductor diode 
in which the reverse current rises abruptly 
upwards of a certain voltage as a result  
of Zener breakdown and/or avalanche 
 effects. This diode is rated for different 
breakdown voltages depending on the 
 particular application. They are designed 
for continuous operation at the breakdown 
voltage. 

Even though large numbers of these 
 diodes depend for their function on ava-
lanche effects rather than Zener break-
down, they are still referred to as Zener 
 diodes.

Application: the Zener diode is mainly 
used for voltage limitation (e.g. damping 
diodes against overvoltage) and for pro-
ducing a voltage reference (e.g. in the 
 voltage regulator). 

Variable-capacitance diode
With the variable-capacitance diode, it is 
possible to exploit the property whereby 
the space-charge region at the p-n junc-
tion of a diode acts like a capacitor; the 
semiconductor material (depletion layer) 
freed of charge carriers acts as the dielec-
tric. An increase in the applied voltage in-
creases the width of the depletion layer

and reduces the capacitance; reducing the 
voltage increases the capacitance. 

Application: variable-capacitance diodes 
are used mainly for resonant circuit tuning 
and frequency multiplication (e.g. in tun-
ers).

Semiconductor resistors
The electrical resistance of these compo-
nents is, by contrast with ohmic resistors, 
dependent on voltage, current intensity 
and temperature. They generally consist of 
polycrystalline semiconductor materials. 
The effects that occur in semiconductor 
resistors are based in part on depletion-
layer properties that appear at the crystal-
lite boundaries.

NTC resistors (thermistors)
NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) 
resistors (thermistors or thermal resistors) 
are, as the name suggests, resistors that 
have a marked negative temperature coef-
ficient. The electrical resistance decreases 
with increasing temperature due to the in-
creasing number of free charge carriers. 
NTC resistors are made from polycrys-
talline metal oxides such as Fe2O3, ZnTiO4 
or MgCr2O4 by a process of compression 
and sintering. Their temperature coeffi-
cients can be as much as –6 %/K.

Application: NTC resistors are used as 
temperature sensors, for example.

The term PTC resistors refers to resistors 
made of semiconductor materials. PTC 
resistors made of ferroelectric ceramic 
material (e.g. polycrystalline barium 
titanate) have a relatively narrow tem-
perature range and a very high positive 
temperature coefficient (+6 to 60 ‰/K). 
PTC resistors made of silicon have a wide 
temperature range and a virtually constant 
positive temperature coefficient (approx. 
+0.8 ‰/K).

Uses: e.g. heater elements for auxiliary 
heaters or diesel-fuel preheating. The 
greater resistance with increasing temper-
ature allows heat output to be adjusted 
 automatically.

Transistors
Transistors can be used to control a large, 
electrical current with a small current. 
Consequently, these semiconductor com-
ponents can be used as switches or ampli-
fiers. “Transistor” is a contraction of the 
term “transfer resistor”.

Figure 3 illustrates the classification of 

the transistor family. 

Application: transistors are hardly ever 
used as individual components any more. 
They are integrated into integrated cir-
cuits (IC) on a semiconductor chip, e.g. as 
circuit breakers in output-stage modules 
or as component parts of densely-inte-
grated logic chips or microcontrollers.

PTC resistors (thermistors)
PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) 
 resistors are resistors that have a positive 
temperature coefficient (of the order of a 
few ‰/K). The resistance value increases 
with rising temperature because lattice 
 oscillations impede the flow of free elec-
trons. PTC resistors conduct electricity 
better at low temperatures than at high 
temperatures. Most metals are thermal 
 resistors with very low temperature 
 coefficients.

Bipolar transistors
Bipolar transistors consist of three zones 
of varying conductivity, the configuration 
being either pnp or npn. These regions 
(and their connections) are called the 
emitter (E), the base (B) and the collec-
tor (C).

Depending on their applications, 

 transistors are categorized as low-signal 
transistors (up to 1 watt power loss), 
power transistors, switching transistors, 
low-frequency transistors, high-frequency 

Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Semiconductor components  |  179

transistors, microwave transistors, photo-
transistors, etc.

Such transistors are called bipolar be-
cause they make use of charge carriers of  
both polarities (holes and electrons). In an 
n-p-n transistor, positive charge carriers 
(holes) in the base current control roughly 
100 times as many negative charge carri-
ers (electrons) flowing between the emitter 
and the collector. This corresponds to a 
current amplification factor of around 100. 
Bipolar transistors are thus controlled by 
means of the base current.

Operating principle of a bipolar transistor
(with reference to an n-p-n transistor):
The emitter-base junction (EB) is poled  
for forward bias (Fig. 4 ). This means that 
electrons migrate into the base region.  
The base-collector junction (BC) is polar-
ized for reverse bias. This induces the 
 formation of a space-charge region with  
a strong electric field. 

Coupling (transistor effect) occurs if the 

two p-n junctions are very close to one 
 another (less than 10 µm apart in silicon). 

3 Transistor family

Transistors

The electrons injected at the EB then dif-
fuse through the base to the collector.  
As soon as they come within the range of 
the electrical field at the BC junction, they 
are accelerated into the collector region 
and travel onwards as the collector cur-
rent. Thus, the concentration gradient in 
the base is retained, and additional elec-
trons continue to migrate from the emitter 
to the collector.

In standard transistors, 99  % or more of 
all the electrons emanating from the emit-
ter reach the BC space-charge region and 
become collector current. The few missing 
electrons are caught in the electron holes 
while traversing the p-doped base. If no 
base current is flowing, the base would be-
come negatively charged and the resulting 
repulsion forces would completely prevent 
the continued flow of electrons within 
an extremely short space of time (50 ns). 
Such a build-up of negative charge can be 
partially or entirely counteracted by a low 
base current of positive charge carriers

(holes). Small changes in the base current 
bring about large variations in the emitter-
collector current.

With moderate base currents, the  
n-p-n transistor acts as a bipolar, current-
controlled, amplifying semiconductor 
component. If the base current alternates 
abruptly between very low and very high 
levels, the transistor acts as a switch.

Field-effect transistors (FET)
In a field-effect transistor (Fig. 5a), the 
current flowing from the source (S) to the 
drain (D) through a conductive channel is 
controlled by an electric field. That field  
is generated by a voltage applied via a 
 control electrode known as the gate (G). 
Between the electrode and the semicon-
ductor is an electrically insulating layer. 
The use of an electric field to control the 
current flow explains the origin of the term 
“field-effect transistor” (FET).

Field-effect transistors differ from their 

bipolar counterparts in utilizing only a 
 single type of charge carrier (electrons or 
holes), giving rise to the alternate designa-
tion “unipolar transistor”. Field-effect 
transistors are subdivided into:
▶  Junction field-effect transistors 

 (junction FET, JFET)

▶  Insulated-gate field-effect transistors, 

in particular metal-oxide semiconductor 
(MOS) field-effect transistors  
(MOS-FETs).

MOS-FETs are not only suitable for ex-
tremely densely integrated circuits, they 
have also penetrated most other fields of 
application for bipolar transistors.

determine the width of the channel. If the 
negative gate voltage is increased, the 
space-charge regions extend further into 
the channel and constrict the current path. 
The voltage at the control electrode (G) 
thus controls the current between the 
source (S) and the drain (D). The FET only 
requires charge carriers of a single polarity 
in order to function. The current is con-
trolled virtually without power consump-
tion. Thus, the junction FET is a unipolar, 
voltage-controlled component.

Operating principle of a MOS FET
(with reference to a MOS FET with p-type 
enrichment): 
While no voltage is present at the gate elec-
trode, no current flows between the source 
(S) and the drain (D); the p-n junctions are 
reverse biased (Fig. 5b). A negative voltage 
applied to the gate (G) forces the electrons 
in the n-type region below the electrode 
into the center of the crystal and draws 
holes – which are always present as minor-
ity charge carriers even in n-type silicon – 
to the surface. A narrow p-type layer forms 
beneath the surface: This is called the  
p-type channel. Current can now flow be-
tween the two p-type regions (source and 
drain). This current consists exclusively of 
holes. As the gate voltage acts through an 
insulating oxide layer, no current flows in 
the control circuit and control therefore re-
quires no power. The MOS transistor is a 
unipolar, voltage-controlled component.

PMOS, NMOS, CMOS transistors
If a p-type channel MOS transistor (PMOS 
transistor) is doped with a donor impurity 
rather than an acceptor impurity, it be-
comes an NMOS transistor. Due to the 
higher mobility of electrons, NMOS tran-
sistors switch faster than PMOS transis-
tors, which are easier to manufacture and 
were therefore available first.

If PMOS and NMOS transistors are 

Their advantages are: 
▶  Very low power loss 
▶  High interference resistance 
▶  Low supply voltage 
▶  Suitability for analog-signal processing 

The low power consumption, particularly 
for digital circuits, is due to the fact that 
current only flows when a digital cell 
changes (e.g. switches from “0” to “1”). 
 Retention of the information requires only 
that a voltage is applied. Since, with this 
configuration, the PMOS and NMOS tran-
sistors are connected to one another, the 
leakage flow is minimal as a consequence  
of the intrinsic conductivity of the silicon. 

More than 80 % of all integrated circuits 

are now manufactured using CMOS tech-
nology.

Monolithic integrated circuits (ICs)
Monolithic integration
The planar process is a method of manufac-
turing semiconductors which makes it pos-
sible to produce all components of a circuit 
(resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors) 
and the conductive connections between 
them on a single silicon wafer (chip) in a 
single production process. It involves the 
creation of multiple p- and n-type layers in 
a multi-stage doping process using a pre-
doped single-crystal silicon disk or wafer.
An integrated circuit (IC) no longer con-
tains any discrete components but rather 
switching elements or functional elements 
(e.g. gates, capacitors). In this way, it is possi-
ble to manufacture complex circuits of small 
size and still meet reliability requirements.

Integration level
The integration level is defined as the 
number of functional elements, transistors 
or gates on a single chip. The following cat-
egories are defined based on the integra-
tion level (and chip surface area):
▶  SSI (Small-Scale Integration): up to 

 created in pairs on the same silicon chip,  
they are referred to as CMOS transistors 
(Complementary MOS transistors, Fig. 5c). 

around 1,000 elements per chip, average 
chip area 3 mm2 (varies considerably 
depending on level of power loss)

182  |  Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Semiconductor components

▶  MSI (Medium-Scale Integration): up to 
around 10,000 elements per chip, aver-
age chip area 8 mm2

▶  LSI (Large-Scale Integration): fewer than 
100,000 elements per chip, average chip 
area 20 mm2

▶  Classification by production technique: 

bipolar/unipolar (MOS) 

  mixed form: e.g. BiCMOS, BCD
▶  Classification by function: 

analog/digital;  
mixed form: e.g. mixed signal IC

▶  VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration): 

▶  Classification by application: 

more than 100,000 elements per chip, 
average chip area 30 mm2

standard IC – ASIC; 
mixed form: e.g. ASSP

The number of functional elements on  
VLSI chips is constantly increasing. Micro-
processors can now have up to 10 million 
transistor functions per chip. Memory 
modules (DRAM) can even contain several 
hundred million transistors. The number 
of such functional elements is subject to  
an exponential increase over time. This 
was first recognized by Gordon Moore 
(co-founder of the company Intel) and  
is formulated in “Gordon Moore’s Law”:
Elements per chip = 2(year – 1956) · 2/3

This means that the number of functions 
per chip will double every 18 months.  
This is because the structural units (width 
of transistors) in which the chips are man-
ufactured are becoming smaller at the 
same time as the number of functional ele-
ments is growing. Thus the structural units 
of new processors have shrunk from 10 µm 
in 1972 to 0.18 µm in the year 2000.

The integration levels of LSI and VLSI 
 demand methods such as CAD (Computer-
Aided Design). VLSI circuits in particular 
can only be created with the help of highly 
sophisticated programs which can convert 
entire function blocks into corresponding 
circuit subdivisions. Such program sys-
tems are called HDL (Hardware Descrip-
tion Language) or VHDL (Visual HDL).

ASIC modules (Application-Specific IC) are 
developed and produced specifically for a 
particular application and exclusively for  
a particular customer.

ASSP modules (Application-Specific 
 Standard Product) are developed and pro-
duced specifically for a particular applica-
tion for a particular customer but also sold 
to others for the same type of application.

Apart from a few exceptions, ICs are now 
always based on MOS or combined tech-
nologies.

Analog circuits
Analog circuits are required wherever 
electronic equipment has to communicate 
with the outside world – which is always 
analog. This applies in particular to the 
 areas of the preparation and processing  
of input and output signals. Examples of 
analog-input signal generators are micro-
phones (telephone) and knock sensors. 
Examples of analog-output signal receiv-
ers are speakers or actuators. 

Applications
▶  Standardized functions: 

stabilized-voltage sources, stabilized-
current sources, differential amplifier 
stages, coupling circuits, potential shift-
ing circuits, output stages

IC classification
There are various systems for classifying 
ICs, although there are invariably mixed 
categories within each system.

▶  Application-based ICs: 

operational amplifiers, voltage regula-
tors, comparators, timers, transducers, 
interface circuits

Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Semiconductor components  |  183

▶  Specialized ICs: 

voltage references, broadband amplifi-
ers, analog multipliers, function genera-
tors, phase-locking circuits, analog 
 filters and switches

Digital circuits
Digital circuits are used wherever large vol-
umes of data have to be processed within  
a short space of time. High-performance 
microcontrollers can perform several hun-
dred million computational operations per 
second. They are thus able to utilize the in-
put data to provide the required, highly ac-
curate response at the output of the partic-
ular device. With digital circuits, even large 
amounts of data can be coded and carried 
on a line, e.g. data transfer on the CAN bus.
Since inputs and outputs for communi-

cation with the real world always have  
to be analog, analog-digital converters 
(ADCs) are used at the inputs of a digital 
circuit, and digital-analog converters 
(DACs) at the outputs.

Digital systems make use of a whole series 
of recurring basic circuits and variations 
of them. The scale ranges from simple 
gates (e.g. inverters, logical AND operator) 
to memories, microprocessors and micro-
controllers. 

Digital modules can only be connected 

up to form a complete system if power 
supply voltages, logic signal levels, switch-
ing speeds and signal transmission times 
are compatible. This requirement is met 
within a family of circuits (e.g. CMOS). 
Since, apart from a few specialized appli-
cations mainly in military systems, CMOS 
logic circuits are the only type now used, 
compatibility is guaranteed.

Mixed-signal ICs
ICs in which both analog and digital circuit 
elements are combined are called mixed-
signal ICs. They are an essential require-
ment for the combination of entire elec-
tronic systems on a single piece of silicon 
(SoC: System-on-a-Chip).

With ever-increasing degrees of integra-
tion, this type of circuit is becoming more 
and more attractive and the number of 
 applications is continually increasing.  
It is now conceivable, for example, to in-
tegrate the entire electronic circuitry for 
a mobile phone or a complete Internet-
access system on a single chip. For com-
mercial reasons, however, two or three 
chips are used. Where only low levels of 
electrical power are required, such as in 
the examples quoted, both the analog and 
the digital sections are manufactured us-
ing CMOS technology.

Mixed-signal ICs for applications involv-
ing higher electrical power levels, such as 
are frequently encountered in automotive 
systems, are typically hybrids of various 
technologies. An example would be BCD 
systems (where B stands for bipolar, C for 
CMOS and D for DMOS). Here, three differ-
ent technologies are used on the one chip 
because they each have properties that are 
complex and expensive to implement us-
ing the other technologies. Bipolar struc-
tures are particularly suitable for handling 
very small currents without distortion.  
The bipolar section is therefore responsi-
ble for converting the analog inputs. CMOS 
is the optimal choice for the rapid process-
ing of digital data. The CMOS section of the 
IC performs the logical processing opera-
tions using digital technology. Using DMOS 
technology, it is possible to produce high 
currents; the DMOS section is therefore 
able to provide high analog output levels.

Optoelectronic components
Photoresistor
A photoresistor is a resistor whose resis-
tance decreases when exposed to light 
(Fig. 6). Light (photons) generates free 
charge carriers in the semiconductor when 
the energy of a photon is equal to the en-
ergy holding a charge carrier within the 
lattice (internal photoelectric effect). The 
photoresistor is thus not equally sensitive 
to all wavelengths. Its maximum sensitivity 
lies within a narrow wavelength band that 

184  |  Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Semiconductor components

is specific to the material used. Photoresis-
tors generally consist of polycrystalline 
semiconductor materials in which the 
 effect is particularly marked such as CdS, 
CdSe, PbS, PbSe, CdTe, ZnO, Se, InSb, InAs, 
Ge or Si. 

Application: photoresistors are mainly 

suitable for use as light meters, e.g. in 
 cameras.

Photodiode
A photodiode is a semiconductor diode 
which utilizes the depletion-layer photo-
electric effect. Reverse voltage is present 
at the p-n junction. Incident light releases 
electrons from the crystal lattice (photo-
electric current). This also results in free 
electrons and holes that increase the re-
verse current in proportion to the light 
 intensity (Fig. 7). 

Application: in the automotive sector, 
photodiodes are used in the rain sensor, 
for example. They measure the scattered 
light emitted by a light emitting diode and 
reflected by the raindrops. 

Photovoltaic cell
Like the photodiode, the photovoltaic cell 
releases charge carriers when exposed to 
light; no external voltage is applied to the 
p-n junction, however. If the electrons and 

holes reach the p-n junction, they are sep-
arated by the internal field of the space-
charge region. A photoelectric voltage is 
generated which produces a photoelectric 
current in the external electric circuit. 
Light energy is thus converted into electri-
cal energy. 

Application: photovoltaic cells are used 
to measure light intensity and to generate 
electricity with solar cells.

LED (Light Emitting Diode)
The light emitting diode (LED) emits light 
when a forward current is passed through 
it. This signifies a reversal of the photodi-
ode effect: free electrons and holes are re-
combined, the energy that is freed in the 
process is emitted as light. The wavelength 
of the light emitted by an LED depends on 
the semiconductor material used. There is 
now a choice of colors available (e.g. red, 
yellow, green, blue, and even infrared). 
The semiconductor materials most com-
monly used are gallium compounds such 
as gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium 
phosphide (GaPh). 

Application: LEDs are used for numeri-
cal and alphabetical displays as well as for 
warning lamps. Since it has been possible 
more recently to produce many colors and 
substantially increase the amount of light

emitted, LEDs are now also used in motor 
vehicles to illuminate the instrument clus-
ter or as a third stop lamp. They have the 
advantage of a relatively high light yield 
and, as a result of their very long service 
life, do not have to be replaced. Another 
example of the LED’s application in the 
motor vehicle is its use in the rain and  
dirt sensor. 

Laser diode
With the appropriate mechanical/optical 
design, LEDs can also be made to emit la-
ser light as laser diodes, i.e. the light emit-
ted is extremely concentrated and coher-
ent. These properties are required for the 
optical data transfer in optical fiber cables 
(e.g. MOST bus). 

Phototransistor
A similar effect to that used by the photo-
diode also occurs in the phototransistor. 
Incident light striking the base alters the 
conductivity between the emitter and the 
collector in such a way that a current pro-
portional to the intensity of the light is able 
to flow through the transistor. Phototrans-
istors can thus be used as a switch for 
 photoelectric light barriers, for instance.
There are also phototransistors that 
 operate in the opposite way, i.e. they emit 
light. The advantage compared to the LED 
is that the phototransistor can be switched 
on and off very quickly. 

Application: the phototransistor is particu-
larly suited for use in the manufacture of 
flatscreen displays. A transistor is used for 
each pixel. As the areas required are gen-
erally substantially larger than the silicon 
slices available, and such slices would,  
in any case, be too expensive, flatscreen 
displays are manufactured using thin-film 
techniques (vapor deposition through a 
screen). 

The advantages of flat screens over 
cathode-ray tubes are their slimmer di-
mensions, lower power consumption and 
the absence of flicker.

Charge-coupled device (CCD)
CCDs are integrated circuits arranged as  
a charge-coupled array. They are used to 
record images in video and digital cameras 
as well as in scanners. Thousands or even 
millions of individual elements laid out in 
a matrix form (array) are created on a chip. 
Digital cameras can record up to 3.5 mil-
lion pixels with a color resolution of 
16 million colors. CCDs are capable of 
 converting the visual information into 
electrical information and storing it until  
it can be transferred to an external storage 
medium. To do this, the output register is 
scanned at a high rate.

Micromechanical sensors
It has been possible for a number of years 
now to manufacture different sensor ele-
ments using silicon technology. Since a 
large number of sensors can be produced 
simultaneously on a single silicon wafer, 
the unit costs are substantially lower than 
in the production of conventional sensors. 
In addition, there is the possibility of hav-
ing the sensor signals directly processed 
on the chip electronically. Examples of 
 micromechanical sensors are:
▶  Magnetic-field sensors: these use the 

hall effect to measure an external mag-
netic field purely electrically (e.g. posi-
tion sensor for camshaft position)
▶  Acceleration and pressure sensors: 

these use capacitance changes, caused 
by mechanical deformation of individual 
regions in the silicon, to record mea-
sured variables (yaw-rate sensor,  
intake-manifold pressure sensor)

▶  Temperature sensors: these make use 
of the relationship between a semicon-
ductor material’s temperature and its 
conductivity (e.g. engine-temperature 
sensor)

▶  Chemical sensors: these make use of the 
effect whereby certain gases and liquids 
specifically alter the electric conductiv-
ity of some semiconductor materials

Manufacture of semi-
conductor components  
and circuits

Semiconductor components 
Most semiconductor components are 
made of silicon. The basic material is  
SiO2 (quartz). It occurs naturally in large 
 quantities as rock crystal or silica sand.  
It is used to make monocrystalline cylin-
ders or rods of extremely pure silicon with 
a dia meter of between approx. 50 mm (2˝) 
and 300 mm (12˝). The most common di-
ameters are 150 mm (6˝) and 200 mm (8˝).
During the production of the crystals, 
they are given a precise conductivity spec-
ified by the component manufacturer 
 (basic doping). The silicone is sawn into 
disks approximately 0.3 to 0.7 mm thick 
which are then smoothed and polished. 
These disks are referred to as wafers.  
The process of producing the semiconduc-
tor components starts with these silicon 
wafers (Fig. 1). 

A large number of identical circuits 
(chips) is created on each wafer and those 
circuits are then separated by mechanical 
means. Before separation, however, the 
chips are tested to make sure they match 
the electrical specifications. Any unusable 
chips are marked and then discarded once 
separated. Only the usable chips are as-
sembled, i.e. cemented, bonded, encased, 
sealed and passed on for final testing 
(Figs. 1 and 3).

The value-added chain from the basic 
 material to the end product shows an 
 extremely high rate of value growth: 
 silicon in the form of silica sand costs 
about 1 euro per kg, but by the time it  
has become a finished microprocessor  
it can be worth up to 1 million euro  
per kg.

Doping processes
Doping involves introducing impurities 
with a known electrical effect into the 
semiconductor crystal at specific points 

and in precisely defined concentration 
 levels using reproducible methods. Doping 
techniques are the fundamental processes 
of semiconductor technology. The target 
parameters are concentration profile, pen-
etration depth, surface concentration and 
planar parallelity of the doping-material 
fronts.

Manufacturers of semiconductor com-

ponents buy their basic material in the 
form of wafers that have been pre-doped 
according to precisely defined specifica-
tions.

Doping during crystal growth
While the crystal is being grown, phos-
phorus, for example, can be added to

the silicon melt as a doping material.  
As the monocrystal forms, the phosphorus 
atoms become fixed in the silicon crystal, 
giving it n-type conducting properties. 

Doping by diffusion
At high temperatures, the doping material 
can diffuse into the silicon crystal. The ef-
fect is achieved by creating a specific con-
centration level of the impurity atoms at 
the surface of the wafer. The difference in 
concentration causes the doping atoms to 
diffuse into the silicon wafer.

The process involves placing between 
50 and 200 wafers in a kiln together and 
exposing them to boron or phosphorus 
compound vapors at temperatures of 
around 1,000 °C. Boron produces p-type 
regions while the effect of phosphorus  
is to create n-type regions. Surface con-
centration levels, temperature, and time, 
are the parameters that determine the 
penetration depth of the doping material.

Doping by ion implantation
In this process, the atoms of a gaseous 
doping material are first of all ionized  
in a vacuum and then accelerated by a  
high voltage (up to 300 kV) so as to be 
“catapulted” into the semiconductor.  
This allows particularly precise control  
of concentration level and localization  
of the  implanted material. Embedding  
of the implanted atoms and restoration  
of the crystal lattice requires thermal 
 aftertreatment.

Epitaxy
This doping method creates a monocrys-
talline doped semiconductor layer a few 
micrometers thick on a monocrystalline 
substrate. If gaseous silicon tetrachloride 
and hydrogen are passed over silicon wa-
fers heated to around 1,200 °C in a quartz 
tube, the vapor breaks down and silicon  
is deposited at a rate of about 1 µm/min, 
forming a monocrystalline layer. If a de-
fined quantity of doping material is added 
to the gas flow, an epitaxial layer is created

whose electric conductivity and conduc-
tion type differs fundamentally and 
abruptly from that of the substrate.

Photolithography and the planar process
In the photolithography process, the pat-
tern of the component design is trans-
ferred to the wafer by using metal screens. 
When the design has been completed,  
the data for producing the screen is saved 
onto a storage medium (e.g. magnetic tape 
or CD). It is then used to control a photo-
graphic exposure device that transfers  
the design pattern to photographic plates. 
This pattern is subsequently reduced by 
optical means to the actual size for the ap-
plication and copied onto metal screens  
on which it is repeated as many times as 
will fit onto the size wafer being used. 

As this method can be used for struc-
tures that are many times smaller than  
the wavelength of the light used, it will 
continue to be used in the future. The size 
of the smallest achievable structures 
 depends on the wavelength of the light 
source. Using UV lasers, photolithographic 
methods have already produced structures 
as small as 0.08 µm in the laboratory  
(by comparison, a human hair has a 
 diameter of 40 to 60 µm). 

Even smaller structures can be produced 
using other methods such as X-ray or elec-
tron-beam lithography. However, those 
methods are substantially more expensive 
as they can only “expose” one IC at a time 
on the wafer. For that reason, they are only 
used in special cases. 

Silicon wafers are easily oxidized by oxy-
gen or water vapor. The oxide layer thus 
created prevents penetration by the dop-
ing atoms in the doping process. In the 
planar process, holes are created in the 
oxide layer so that when the wafer is 
doped, localized areas of n-type and  
p-type material are created.

The wafer is coated with a special lacquer 
and then exposed to light while covered 
with a metal screen. Following developing, 
the areas of the lacquer coating  previously 
covered by the screen and the oxide layer 
below it can be removed by etching. The 
position, size and shape of the holes thus 
created match precisely the specified de-
sign. In the subsequent doping process in 
the diffusion furnace or during ion implan-
tation, materials which have a known elec-
trical effect such as boron or phosphorus 
pass through those holes in the oxide layer 
into the silicon, thereby creating n-type or 
p-type regions in the desired locations. Af-
terwards, the oxide layer is removed again 
and the wafer is ready for the next stage in 
the manufacturing process. 

The photolithographic process and the 
doping process are repeated as many 
times as required to produce the desired 
number of layers of different conductivity 
on the semiconductor component. In the 
case of complex integrated circuits, this 
may involve as many as 20 or more sepa-
rate manufacturing stages. In order to pro-
vide the electrical connections between 
the resulting functional elements, the wa-
fers are coated with aluminum or copper 
and then the metal conductor track pat-
terns are formed. This process too may 
 involve the formation of multiple layers  
of metal, one above the other. 

Completion of the wafer production 
 process is followed by electrical testing 
(preliminary testing) of the individual 
chips on the wafer. Chips that do not meet 
the specifications are marked with colored 
dots. The wafers are then cut up into indi-
vidual chips using a diamond cutting tool. 
The functional chips are subsequently 
placed in metal or plastic casings and fit-
ted with external connections. After being 
hermetically sealed or encased in plastic, 
they go through a final testing stage.

Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Manufacture of semi conductor components and circuits  |  189

Conventional printed-circuit boards
The printed-circuit board has become an 
electronic component in its own right. It 
has to have precisely defined electrical and 
mechanical properties. In a motor  vehicle, 
for example, the printed-circuit board may 
be required to withstand temperatures 
ranging from –40 to +145 °C. The standards 
required in respect of EMC (ElectroMag-
netic Compatibility), maximum current ca-
pacity and complexity are becoming more 
and more demanding. And at the same 
time, the circuit boards are continually 
 expected to become smaller and cheaper – 
in spite of shorter product life cycles.

The basic material – the baseboard – is 
glass fiber. It can be rigid or semi-flexible. 
The conductor tracks on the surface are 
made from a thin layer of copper 12 to  
70 µm thick (copper base). To protect it 
against corrosion, the surface of the cop-
per is protected by a coating of tin alloy, 
gold or an organic surface sealant, de-
pending on the type of application.

Designs
Depending on the complexity of the 
 circuit, printed-circuit boards may be 
made up of a number of layers (Fig. 4).

4 Types of printed-circuit board

Circuit boards used in motor vehicles con-
sist of between two and eight layers.

Single-sided circuit board
The pattern of conductor tracks and solder 
eyes is only on one side of the baseboard 
(a).

Double-sided, non-interconnected circuit  
board
There are patterns of conductor tracks on 
both sides of the circuit board. However, 
those two circuits are not connected to 
each other (b).

Double-sided, interconnected circuit board
The conductor track patterns on each side 
are interconnected via copper layers on 
the walls of the holes (c).

Multilayer circuit board 
In addition to the two outer layers (in this 
case the 1st and 4th layers), there are addi-
tional conductor layers on the inside of the 
baseboard (internal layers). Those conduc-
tor layers may be electrically connected 
with one another. To that end, the relevant

Subsequent processing
Once the circuit board has been produced, 
it has to be fitted with the circuit compo-
nents. These subsequent processing stages 
also demand the highest quality standards 
so as to ensure reliable operation of the 
electronic control units in the motor vehi-
cle. There are two methods of mounting 
the components on the board – through-
fitting and surface mounting.

 sequence, aligned to a particular spatial 
 arrangement and tied to a cyclic timing pat-
tern”. Furthermore, the flow principle in-
volves “arrangement of the individual work 
stations according to the order in which the 
operations are performed”. This method is 
also referred to as line production.

Production of the electronic circuitry in an 
ECU involves the following stages:

Through-fitting method
With the through-fitting method, the com-
ponent connections are passed through 
the holes in the circuit board and then 
 soldered (Fig. 6a).

Surface-mounting method
The surface-mounting method (SMT, 
 Surface Mount Technology) uses special 
electronic components whose connections 
lie flat against the surface of the printed-
circuit board (Fig. 6b). Such components 
are referred to as SMDs (Surface Mounted 
Devices). Another advantage – in addition 
to the greater component density achiev-
able – is that the components can be fitted 
to the circuit board fully automatically. 
The surface-mounting method is therefore 
becoming more and more widely adopted. 
The component fitting machines used  
can achieve work rates of more than 
60,000 components an hour, increasing 
productivity as a result.

Production process
There are various production systems that 
are used in the subsequent processing of 
circuit boards and they are classified ac-
cording to the spatial arrangement of the 
production equipment and the work areas. 
The categories distinguished are job-shop, 
pool, flow-shop and flow production.

The process described below is an example 
of flow production (Fig. 7). According to the 
standard DIN 33 415, flow production in-
volves “a process of operations organized 
according to the flow principle in a rigid 

Basic materials
The basic materials consist of printed-
 circuit boards that have not yet been fitted 
with circuit components. Usually, one or 
more circuit boards are arranged on a 
“panel” of standardized dimensions.  
After being fitted with components, the 
circuit boards are cut out of the panel.

Solder-paste application
The first stage is the application of solder 
paste for the SMDs using a screen printing 
process. The solder paste is a mixture of 
metal powder, flux and other organic addi-
tives. It is pressed through the spaces in the 
printing screen onto the panel with the aid 
of a “scraper”.

SMD fitting (reflow side)
An automatic component-insertion ma-
chine presses the SMDs into the solder 
paste applied to the panel.

Reflow oven
The panel passes through a reflow oven on 
a conveyor belt. The heat of the oven melts 
the solder paste on the panel. This electri-
cally and mechanically connects the com-
ponents to the pcb.

Position checking
The camera of a vision system examines 
the soldering points (position checking 
system). Depending on the findings of the 
examination, the panel may be diverted to 
a repair station or automatically moved on 
to the next stage of production.

Turning the circuit board
In this stage, the circuit board is rotated 
through 180 degrees so that the “under-
side” is facing upwards and can be worked 
on. The way in which components are fit-
ted to the underside depends on the na-
ture of the second soldering stage: if the 
reflow/reflow method is used, the process 
described above is repeated. 

If the alternative reflow/wave method is 
used, the SMDs are fitted differently since 
the soldering method is different from that 
used for the top side. A cementing station 
is required.

Cementing station (underside)
At the cementing station, cement spots are 
first of all applied in those positions on the 
“underside” where SMDs are to be placed. 
This is done using pipettes or a screen, 

similar to the procedure for applying the 
solder paste. The cement holds the SMDs 
in position until they are soldered.

SMD fitting (underside)
At succeeding stations along the assembly 
line, the circuit components are placed on 
the cement spots. On this side of the circuit 
board, only components that are suitable 
for attachment by wave soldering can be 
fitted.

Cement hardening
In order to prevent the components falling 
off during the soldering process, the ce-
ment is hardened in an oven.

Component checking
A visual component checking system 
checks that all components are present 
and that they are in the correct positions 
on the underside of the circuit board. 
Non-compliant products are indicated  
and diverted to a repair station.

Turning the circuit board
The circuit board is once again rotated 
through 180 degrees, returning it to its 
original orientation.

Wired-component fitting
This stage involves fitting components that 
have leads attached (e.g. large coils and 
connectors) into ready-made holes (solder 
eyes) in the panel using the through-fitting 
method. They are subsequently soldered 
on the reverse side at the same time as the 
SMDs during the wave-soldering stage. 
The wired-component fitting stage com-
pletes the component fitting operations.

Wave soldering
The wave soldering stage solders the 
 connections of all SMDs and “wired com-
ponents” on the underside. The wave sol-
dering process involves the following 
three stages:
1.  Flux is applied to the underside of the 

panel.

Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Manufacture of semi conductor components and circuits  |  193

2.  The panel then passes through a pre-

heating zone so that the components are 
not damaged by the sudden increase in 
temperature in the subsequent stage.
3.  The panel passes over a wave of liquid 
solder created by a jet. As it does so,  
the solder is deposited on the soldering 
points (pads) on the panel. The solder 
resist on the circuit board prevents the 
solder attaching itself in the wrong 
places.

Position checking
Another camera checks the finished sol-
dered connections. If faults are found,  
the panel is passed to a repair station.

In-circuit testing (ICT)
The purpose of the in-circuit test is to 
check that the electrical circuit is working 
properly. The testing equipment is con-
nected via a testing adaptor and checks 
the components for correct function and 
electrical readings.

Cutting
The individual circuit boards are now cut 
out of the panel using computer-controlled 
machines.

Final assembly
In the final-assembly stage, the circuit 
board is fitted into the ECU casing.

Temperature testing
The finished ECU is subjected to very high 
temperatures in order to test its ability to 
withstand extreme conditions. The tests 
simulate operation of the ECU in real con-
ditions. In this way, component or solder-
ing faults can be detected.

Final testing
Before the ECU leaves the production line, 
it is subjected to a final test to make sure  
it performs the functions required of it in 
actual use.

Film and hybrid circuits

Film circuits
In film integrated circuits, passive circuit 
elements (usually conductor tracks, insu-
lation and resistors, but also capacitors 
and inductors) are applied to a base (sub-
strate) in layers. The advantages of these 
circuits are:
▶  Fine structures (up to approx. 10 µm) 

with high element density and

▶  Good high-frequency characteristics 

Those advantages are counterbalanced by 
relatively high production costs.

The thickness of the films originally gave 

rise to the terms “thin-film circuit” and 
“thick-film circuit”. Classification is now 
based on differences in the method of 
 production.

Thin-film circuits 
With thin-film circuits, the films are ap-
plied to glass or ceramic substrates using 
vacuum-coating processes.

Thick-film circuits 
For thick-film circuits, the preferred 
method of manufacture involves applica-
tion of the films to ceramic substrates  
by screen printing processes followed  
by  firing.

Ceramic multilayer substrates
Ceramic multilayer substrates are made  
up of unfired ceramic foils onto which 
 conductor tracks are applied by screen 
printing methods. Several such foils are 
then combined to form a multilayer lami-
nate which is fired at 850 to 1,600 °C so 
that it becomes a solid ceramic element 
with integral conductor channels. A typi-
cal hybrid substrate consists of four or  
five layers. Particularly high wiring densi-
ties can be achieved with LTCC-line sub-
strates (Low-Temperature Cofired Ce-
ramic, i.e. ceramic material which has been 
fired (sintered) together (simultaneously) 
at low temperature).

To make the electrical connections be-
tween layers, holes are punched in the in-
dividual films and filled with metal paste. 
Those holes are referred to as so-called 
“vias”. Special materials are employed  
to integrate resistors and capacitors in  
the device. The wiring densities of these 
circuits is considerably greater than with 
thick-film circuits.

Hybrid circuits
Hybrid circuits are integrated film circuits 
with additional discrete components such 
as capacitors and integrated semiconduc-
tor circuits (ICs) that are attached by sol-
dering or cementing. The use of unpacked 
semiconductor chips, to which the connec-
tions are made by bonding, or SMDs makes 
high component densities possible. A ce-
ramic multilayer substrate can be used to 
achieve extremely small hybrid control 
 devices (microhybrids). The advantages  
of these circuits are:
▶  High permissible installation tempera-

tures due to their good heat dissipation 
properties 

▶  Compactness of design combined with 

good vibration resistance and
▶  Good resistance against media 

Hybrid circuits are therefore particularly 
suited to use in telecommunications sys-
tems and for automotive applications 
where they can be found in ABS, traction 
control, ESP, transmission control and 
 engine-management control units (engine-
mounted).

Figure 8 shows the basic stages in the 
 production of a hybrid-circuit substrate. 
The tapes are punched with holes for the 
vias for each separate wiring layer and  
the holes are then filled with silver paste 
(Fig. 9a). Screen-printing stations print  
the conductor tracks onto the film.  
The various layers are aligned with each 
other, laminated and then fired at 890 °C.  
A specially controlled sintering process 
keeps the ceramic firing to within toler-

Electronic components in the vehicle  |  Manufacture of semi conductor components and circuits  |  195

ance limits of approximately 0.03 %.  
This is important for the packing density. 
The circuit’s resistors are printed on the 
reverse side of the substrate and fired  
(Fig. 9b). 

For bonding on the top side, the surfaces 

are finished using a plating process 
adapted to the LTCC. The spacing of the 
microcontroller contacts (bond land grid 
on the substrate) ranges from 450 to  
260 µm. The component connections  
are bonded using 32-µm gold wire and 
200-µm aluminum wire.

Alongside the electrical vias, there  
are also thermal vias with a diameter of 
300 µm for optimum cooling of ICs with 
high power losses. The effective thermal 
conductivity of the substrate can thus  
be increased from approx. 3 W/mK to  
20 W/mK.

All components are cemented with con-
ductive cement. There are two methods 
used for final assembly of the finished 
 hybrid.

Method 1: the finished hybrid is cemented 
to the steel panel of the casing using heat-
conducting cement and connected to the 
glass feed-through for the connector using 
bonded 200-µm aluminum wire. The cas-
ing is then hermetically sealed.

Method 2: the finished hybrid is cemented 
to the aluminum casing using heat-con-
ducting cement and connected to the plas-
tic-encased connector pins using bonded 
gold or 300-µm aluminum wire. Before the 
cover is cemented in place, a gel is applied 
to protect the circuit.

196  |  Control units  |  Operating conditions, design, data processing

Control units

Digital technology furnishes an extensive 
array of options for open and closed-loop 
control of automotive electronic systems. 
A large number of parameters can be in-
cluded in the process to support optimal 
operation of various systems. The control 
unit receives the electrical signals from 
the sensors, evaluates them, and then 
calculates the triggering signals for the 
actuators. The control program, the 
“software”, is stored in a special memory 
and implemented by a microcontroller. 
The control unit and its components are 
referred to as hardware. The Motronic 
control unit contains all of the algo-
rithms for open and closed-loop control 
needed to govern the engine-manage-
ment processes (ignition, induction and 
mixture formation, etc.).

Operating conditions

The control unit is subjected to very  
high demands with respect to
▶  Extreme ambient temperatures 

(in normal vehicle operation from  
–40 to +60...+125  °C)

▶  Extreme temperature changes
▶  Indirect materials and supplies 

(oil, fuel etc.)

▶  The effects of moisture and
▶  Mechanical stress such as vibration 

from the engine

The control unit must operate reliably 
when the vehicle is started with a weak 
battery (e.g. cold start) and with high 
charge voltages (vehicle electrical system 
fluctuations).

Other requirements arise from the need 
for EMC (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility). 
The requirements regarding immunity to 
electromagnetic interference and limita-
tion of high-frequency interference signal 
emission are extremely stringent.

Design

The printed circuit board with the electri-
cal components (Fig. 1) is installed in a 
housing of plastic or metal. A multiple  
plug connects the control unit to the sen-
sors, actuators and electrical power sup-
ply. The high-performance driver circuits 
that provide direct control of the actuators 
are specially integrated within the housing 
to ensure effective heat transfer to the 
housing and the surrounding air.

The majority of the electrical compo-
nents are of the surface-mounted device 
technology type. This concept provides 
extremely efficient use of space in low-
weight packages. Only a few power com-
ponents and the connectors use push-
through assembly technology.

Hybrid versions combining compact 
 dimensions with extreme resistance to 
thermal attack are available for mounting 
directly on the engine.

Data processing

Input signals
In their role as peripheral components,  
the actuators and the sensors represent 
the interface between the vehicle and the 
control unit in its role as the processing 
unit. The electrical signals of the sensors 
are routed to the control unit via a wiring 
harness and the connector plug. These sig-
nals can be of the following type: 

Analog input signals
Within a given range, analog input signals 
can assume practically any voltage value. 
Examples of physical quantities which  
are available as analog measured values 
are intake-air mass, battery voltage, in-
take-manifold and boost pressure, coolant 
and intake-air temperature. They are con-
verted into digital values by an analog-
 digital converter in the microcontroller

of the control unit and used for calcula-
tions by the microcontroller CPU. The 
maximum resolution of these analog sig-
nals is 5 mV. This translates into roughly 
1,000 incremental graduations based on 
an overall measuring range of 0 to 5 V.

Digital input signals
Digital input signals only have two states. 
They are either “high” or “low” (logical 1 
and logical 0 respectively). Examples of 
digital input signals are on/off switching 
signals, or digital sensor signals such as 
the rotational-speed pulses from a Hall 
generator or a magnetoresistive sensor. 
Such signals are processed directly by  
the microcontroller.

Pulse-type input signals
The pulse-shaped input signals from 
 inductive-type sensors containing infor-
mation on rotational speed and reference 
mark are conditioned in their own control 
unit stage. Here, spurious pulses are sup-
pressed and the pulse-shaped signals 
 converted into digital rectangular signals.

Signal conditioning
Protective circuits limit the voltages of in-
put signals to levels suitable for process-
ing. Filters separate the useful signal from 
most interference signals. When neces-
sary, the signals are then amplified to the 
input voltage required by the microcon-
troller (0 to 5 V).

Signal conditioning can take place com-
pletely or partially in the sensor depend-
ing upon the sensor’s level of integration. 

Signal processing
The control unit is the switching center 
governing all of the functions and se-
quences regulated by the engine-manage-
ment system. The closed and open-loop 
control functions are executed in the mi-
crocontroller. The input signals that are 
provided by the sensors and the interfaces 
to other systems (such as the CAN bus) are 
used as input variables. and are subjected 
to a further plausibility check in the com-
puter. The control unit program supports 
generation of the output signals used to 
control the actuators.

Output signals
The microcontroller uses the output sig-
nals to control output stages that usually 
provide enough power for connecting the 
actuators directly. It is also possible to ac-
tuate certain output stage relays for con-
sumers that use up a great deal of power 
(e.g. motor fans).

The output stages are proof against 

short circuits to ground or battery voltage, 
as well as against destruction due to elec-
trical or thermal overload. Such malfunc-
tions, together with open-circuit lines or 
sensor faults are identified by the output-
stage IC as an error and reported to the 
microcontroller.

Switching signals
Actuators can be switched on and off using 
the switching signals (e.g. motor fans).

PWM signals
Digital output signals can be in the form  
of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) signals. 
These are constant-frequency rectangular 
signals with variable on-times (Fig. 2), 
 Various actuators can be moved to various 
operating positions using these signals  
(e.g. exhaust-gas recirculation valve, 
boost-pressure actuator).

Control unit-internal communication
In order to be able to support the micro-
controller in its work, the peripheral 
 components must communicate with it. 
This takes place using an address/data  
bus which, The microcontroller outputs 
the RAM address whose contents are to  
be read (for example) via the address bus. 
The data bus is then used to transmit the 
relevant data. For former automotive ap-
plications, an 8-bit bus topology sufficed. 
This meant that the data bus comprised  
8 lines which together could transmit  
256 values simultaneously. 65,536 ad-
dresses can be accessed using the 16-bit 
address bus in this system. Presently,  
more complex systems demand 16 bits,  
or even 32 bits, for the data bus. In order 
to save on pins at the components, the data 
and address buses can be combined in a 
multiplex system, i.e. addresses and data 
are dispatched through the same lines  
but offset from each other with respect  
to time.

Serial interfaces with just a single data 
line are used for data that does not have  
to transmitted extremely quickly (e.g. fault 
memory data).

EOL programming
The extensive variety of vehicle variants 
with differing control programs and data 
records, makes it imperative to have a sys-
tem which reduces the number of control 
unit types needed by a given manufac-
turer. To this end, the Flash-EPROM’s com-
plete memory area can be programmed  
at the end of production with the program 
and the variant-specific data record  
(this is the so-called End-of-Line, or EoL, 
programming). 
  Another way of reducing the type 
 diversity is to store several data variants 
(e.g. transmission variants) in the memory, 
which are then selected using coding at the 
end of the production line. This coding is 
stored in an EEPROM.

Digital modules in the  
control unit

Microcontroller
Structure
A microcontroller consists of the following 
interacting components (Fig. 1):
▶  Central processing unit (CPU): this con-

tains the control unit and the arithmetic 
and logic unit. The control unit executes 
the instructions from the program mem-
ory, whereas the arithmetic and logic 
unit performs arithmetical and logical 
operations. 

▶  Input and output devices (I/O, Input/Out-
put), which handle the exchange of data 
with peripheral devices. Peripheral de-
vices include input and output devices 
and external data storage media.

▶  Program memory, in which the operating 
program (user program) is permanently 
stored (ROM, PROM, EPROM or flash 
EPROM). 

▶  Data memory, which is accessed for 

reading and writing (RAM). This con-
tains the data that is currently being 
processed. Non-volatile memory 
 (EEPROM) is used for data that must  
not be deleted when the supply voltage 
is switched off. 

▶  The bus system connects the individual 

elements of the microcontroller. 

▶  A clock generator (oscillator) ensures 
that all operations in the microcon-
troller take place within a defined timing 
pattern. 

▶  Logic circuits are modules with special-
ized tasks such as program interrupts. 
They are integrated in individual  
I/O units.

The chief components of a microcomputer 
are generally separate modules connected 
to one another on a printed-circuit board. 
The microprocessor within such as system 
– the CPU – is not functional on its own:  
it is always part of a microcomputer.  

In a microcomputer, however, the above-
mentioned functions are integrated on a 
silicon wafer (system-on-a-chip). This is 
not functional on its own (standalone) and 
is therefore referred to as a single chip 
 microcomputer. 

The microcontroller is used to control 
self-regulating systems such as an engine-
management system. Depending on the 
application, they may also have expansion 
modules connected to them (e.g. addi-
tional memory for data and program 
code).

The user program is fixed and is not re-

placed for different applications. This is 
the difference between a microcontroller 
system, for example, and a PC.

Programming
The only command form capable of direct 
interpretation by a microprocessor is a  
bit pattern, i.e. the binary representation 
of a number. Since, however, this form of 
instruction is not easy to work with for a 
programmer, and is therefore susceptible 
to errors, easily memorable abbreviations 
(mnemonics) are used. These are automat-
ically translated by an assembler program 
into bit patterns (machine code) that can 
be understood by the microprocessor. 
For more complex systems and pro-
grams, high-level programming languages 
such as C are needed, as otherwise it would 
be impossible to keep extensive programs 
manageable and free of errors. Such lan-
guages require sophisticated translation 
programs (compilers) which convert the 
text of the high-level language into a form 
that can be processed by the microcon-
troller.

The machine code is stored in the 
 program memory, where it remains 
 permanently. The CPU accesses these 
components via the bus system, reads  
the numerically coded commands and 
 executes then.

Semiconductor memories
Applications
Memories are used to store large volumes 
of
▶  Digital signals representing data 

(I/O data, statuses, intermediate results 
involving frequent and rapid reading 
and writing)

▶  Program code (usually permanently 

stored) and

▶  Constants (permanently stored)

Storage involves
▶  Recording (writing)
▶  Permanent retention (actual storage) 

▶  Location and retrieval (reading) of 

and

 information

Memories utilize physical effects that 
clearly and easily create and show two 
 different states (e.g. conducting/non-con-
ducting or loaded/not loaded). The infor-
mation that is to be stored must therefore 
exist in binary form, i.e. encoded as a 
 series of “yes or no” statuses (logical “1”  
or logical “0”). Such a “yes or no” unit of 
information is called a bit (binary digit).

Memory modules are organized on a bit or 
word basis, depending on the application. 
A “word” is a group of bits that can be pro-
cessed as a single unit. The word length is 
equal to the number of bits processed as  
a single unit. Eight bits are referred to as  
a byte.

Memories can be organized on the basis 
of different word lengths. An 8 M x 8-RAM, 
for example, has a memory capacity of  
8 million times 8 bits (64 Mbits). The data 
is organized into bytes (8 bits), making the 
memory capacity 8 Mbytes. 

Word lengths of 4, 8, 16 and 32 bits are 
common in microcontroller systems.  
The word length is one of the factors that 
determines the performance capability of 
the system. The word length that is used 
depends on the performance capability 
 requirements of the system.

The most important terms are explained 
below according to their standardized def-
initions, where applicable, or their most 
common usage (see Figure 2 for overview).

Erasable ROM 
There are also ROMs whose contents can 
be erased and reprogrammed as outlined 
below.

EPROM (Erasable PROM)
This type of erasable read-only memory 
can have its contents completely wiped  
by irradiation with UV light and can then 
be reprogrammed using a programming 
device. 

EEPROM (Electrical EPROM) 
The EEPROM (also known as E2PROM) can 
be electrically erased and reprogrammed. 
Every storage cell of an EEPROM be indi-
vidually overwritten. For that reason,  
this type of memory module can also  
be used as nonvolatile data memory  
(e.g. for learned information in engine 
management systems).

Flash EEPROM
A more sophisticated variant of the 
EPROM and EEPROM is flash EEPROM.  
In this case, electrical flash pulses are used 
to erase specific storage areas or the entire 
contents of the memory. The erased areas 
can subsequently be reprogrammed. 

The flash memory can be reprogrammed 

on a programming station. However, the 
advantage of flash EEPROM is that is can 
also be reprogrammed while still inside 
the sealed control unit. 

Flash EEPROM is used in cases where 
relatively large quantities of data need  
to be stored, but must also be modifiable 
(e.g. program memory in vehicle control 
units).

Random-access memory (RAM)
Random-access memory or RAM is a 
short-term memory that allows direct ac-
cess to any storage location. Information 
can be read/written from/to the memory 
any number of times. 

Static RAM (SRAM)
Static RAMs use bistable switching ele-
ments as the data storage cells. Their func-
tionality is similar to that of a flip-flop,  
a simple circuit with two transistors, of 
which either the one (logical “1”) or the 
other (logical “0”) conducts at any one 
time. In SRAM, the information remains 
stored until the storage cell concerned  
is addressed and overwritten, or the 
 operating voltage is switched off.  
SRAM is therefore volatile memory. 

Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Unlike SRAM, the information is stored  
as an electrical charge in the gate capacity 
of a CMOS transistor in dynamic RAM 
(DRAM). As such capacitors are suscepti-
ble to leakage, the charge is gradually lost. 
In order to retain the information, the 
charge has to be refreshed at regular 
 intervals (every few ms). 

Read-only memory 
Read-only memory (ROM) is permanent-
storage memory that allows any memory 
location to be accessed directly but – as the 
name indicates – allows the information 
only to be read and not modified. 

A ROM is nonvolatile memory, i.e. the 
 information it contains is retained even 
when the operating voltage is switched off. 
It is usually used to store program code 
(control programs) and fixed data (func-
tion tables, encoding rules, engine charac-
teristic data maps) that need to be retriev-
able at any time. The information may  
be indelibly entered in the memory by  
the manufacturer or the user by means  
of appropriate programming of specially 
prepared memories (PROMs or program-
mable ROMs).

Control unit software

Real-time capability
One of the requirements on electronic sys-
tems is real-time capability. This means 
that control procedures must react to in-
put signals within an extremely short time. 
For example, a wheel that has a tendency 
to lock must be detected so quickly that 
the ABS control algorithm in the control 
unit can reduce the brake pressure via  
the hydraulic modulator quickly enough. 
Brake slip is therefore reduced before  
the wheel can lock. Engine management 
systems make considerable real-time ca-
pability demands so that crankshaft angles 
can be adhered to with extreme accuracy 
at fast engine speeds for injection and igni-
tion timing purposes.

The complexity of an electronic system 
therefore makes extremely high demands 
of the software that is developed. The soft-
ware structure is explained below on the 
basis of an example.

Software structure
The microcontroller in the control unit ex-
ecutes commands sequentially. The com-
mand code is obtained from the program 
memory. The time taken to read in and

 execute the command depends on the 
 microcontroller that is used and the clock 
frequency. The microcontrollers that are 
currently used in vehicles can execute up 
to 1 million commands per second.

Because of the limited speed at which 
the program can be executed, a software 
structure with which time-critical func-
tions can be processed with high priority 
is required.

The engine-management program has  
to react extremely quickly to signals from 
the speed sensor, which records the en-
gine speed and the crankshaft position. 
These signals arrive at short intervals that 
can be a matter of milliseconds, depending 
on the engine speed. The control unit pro-
gram has to evaluate these signals with 
high priority. Other functions such as 
reading in the engine temperature are not 
as urgent, since the physical variable only 
changes extremely slowly in this case.

Interrupt control
As soon as an event occurs that requires  
an extremely rapid response (e.g. speed 
sensor pulse), the program that is cur-
rently running must be interrupted. This 
can be done using the microcontroller’s 
 interrupt control facility. Events can trig-
ger a program execution interrupt, where-
upon the program jumps and executes  
the “interrupt routine”. When this routine 
has been executed, the program resumes 
at the point at which it was interrupted 
(Fig. 1).

An interrupt can be triggered by an ex-
ternal signal, for example. Other interrupt 
sources are timers integrated in the micro-
controller, with which timed output signals 
can be generated (e.g. ignition signal: 
 microcontroller ignition output is switched 
at a point in time that is calculated before-
hand). However, the timer can also gener-
ate internal time frames.

The control unit program reacts to several 
of these interrupts. An interrupt source 
can therefore request an interrupt while 
another interrupt routine is currently 
 being executed. Every interrupt source 
therefore has a fixed priority assigned to 
it. The priority controller decides which 
interrupt is allowed to interrupt another 
interrupt.

Tooth interrupt
The crankshaft is equipped with a pulse 
wheel (Fig. 2a) that has a certain number  
of teeth on its circumference. The teeth  
are scanned by the speed sensor. This 
 allows the crankshaft position to be re-
corded. The typical distance between  
a pair of teeth on the crankshaft sensor 
wheel is 6°. In order to determine the 
crankshaft position, the control unit pro-
gram must execute certain routines as  
each tooth is detected. At 6,000 rpm the 
detection time between two teeth is ap-
proximately 300 µs. Every command in 
these routines must be executed within  
this time. This requires a rapid response

to the speed sensor signal. For this pur-
pose, the engine-speed signal is connected 
to a microcontroller interrupt input. Every 
falling signal edge at this input interrupts 
the current calculations that are in prog-
ress and forces a branch to the interrupt 
routine. After executing the  commands in 
the interrupt routine, the program contin-
ues execution at its point of origin.

In order to perform certain operations 
the control unit program requires the time 
taken for the crankshaft to travel between 
one tooth and the next. This calculation is 
performed by an internal timer. This is a 
freewheeling 16-bit counter (Fig. 3) that 
increments at a certain rate, depending on 
the microcontroller oscillator clock cycle. 
This time frame amounts to about 0.5 µs. 
When the falling tooth flank occurs,  
the current counter status is recorded.  
The difference (and therefore the tooth 
 interval) is calculated using the stored 
counter from the previous tooth.

Example: crankshaft position calculation
The engine-management system (Motronic 
for gasoline engines, EDC for diesel en-
gines) must know the crankshaft position 
at any given point in time. This is a pre-
requisite for injecting into the right cylin-
der at the right time and ensuring that ig-
nition takes place at the calculated ignition 
angle (Motronic systems). In order to

 detect the engine position and the engine 
speed, the control unit evaluates the speed 
sensor signal (Fig. 2b).

There is gap in the crankshaft sensor 

wheel in which two teeth are missing.  
The tooth space has a defined position  
in relation to the top dead center (TDC) of 
cylinder no. 1. The control unit program 
has to synchronize itself with this tooth 
space. This is done by measuring the times 
between two consecutive falling tooth 
flanks. The time for the tooth space is 
 considerably greater than the time before 
and after the gap. Following a “short –  
long – short” sequence the last thing to  
be scanned was the falling flank of the 
 second tooth after the space.

The crankshaft has rotated by 6° for 
each falling tooth flank that has been de-
tected by the control unit program. This is 
how the control unit program knows the 
crankshaft position within this time frame.
Since cylinder no. 1 is in the tooth space 

position in the vicinity of top dead center 
(TDC) or bottom dead center (BDC), an ad-
ditional signal is required to determine the 
position. The camshaft sensor provides  
a different voltage level in both cases.  
The control unit is therefore able to 
uniquely assign the crankshaft and 
 camshaft positions. 

Combustion-synchronous interrupt
Some calculations have to be performed 
for every combustion cycle. For example, 
the ignition angle and the injection have  
to be recalculated synchronously with 
combustion for each cylinder. The pro-
gram does this by branching to the “syn-
chronization program” after certain teeth 
(Fig. 4). This interrupt takes place after 
 every 30 teeth (ignition interval) for a four-
cylinder engine, and after every 20 teeth 
for a six-cylinder engine. 

The synchronization program is fixed to 

a certain tooth position and has to be exe-
cuted with high priority. For this reason it 
is activated via an interrupt (triggered by a 
command in the tooth interrupt routine). 

Since the synchronization program runs 
over several teeth at fast engine speeds,  
it has to be interrupted by the tooth inter-
rupt. The tooth interrupt is given higher 
priority than the synchronization pro-
gram.

Ignition interrupt
The ignition output takes place within a 
certain crankshaft range, depending on 
the value from the ignition map. Since the 
specified ignition angle has to be adhered 
to exactly, the ignition output is controlled 
by an interrupt. Like the synchronization 
program, the ignition interrupt is also 
called up once per combustion cycle. 

The control unit program is aware of the 

crankshaft position in the 6° framework. 
However, this framework is not accurate 
enough for ignition angle output. For this 
reason, accurate ignition output between 
two teeth must take place as well as this 
approximate counting for the last 0 to 
6 crankshaft degrees. This is done using  
a timer (Fig. 5). Ignition angle output that 
was purely timer-controller would lead  
to an ignition angle output error at high 
engine speed dynamics.

Firstly, the ignition coil must be enabled 

for a defined time (the so-called dwell pe-
riod). In order to do this, the program cal-
culates the switch-on time by calculating

backwards from the ignition angle at which 
the ignition coil has to be switched off. 
This makes it possible to calculate the 
tooth after which the ignition coil has to  
be switched off (approximate counting  
in 6° time frame). The remaining angle 
 (detailed counting 0 to 6°) is converted  
into an output time using the current en-
gine speed. As soon as the specified tooth 
position has been reached using approxi-
mate counting, a time is loaded with the 
output value from the detailed counting. 
When this time period expires, the timer 
triggers an interrupt. The commands that 
switch on the ignition coil are programmed 
in this interrupt routine. Then the timer  
is preset to the dwell period value, which 
causes an interrupt to be triggered when 
the timer elapses, switching off the igni-
tion coil and therefore initiating ignition.

Time frame
Many control algorithms have to run 
within a certain time frame. Lambda con-
trol, for example, has to be processed 
within a fixed time frame (e.g. 10 ms) so 
that the correcting variables are calculated 
quickly enough.

Background program
All other activities that do not run in  
an  interrupt routine or a time frame are 
 processed in the background program.  
At fast engine speeds, the synchronization 
program and the tooth interrupt are called 
frequently, leaving little CPU time for the 
background program. The time taken for a 
complete run-through of the background 
program therefore increases rapidly with 
the increasing engine speed. The back-
ground program must therefore only 
 contain low-priority functions.

208  |  Automotive sensors  |  Basics and overview

Automotive sensors

The term sensor has become common,  
as in the past 20 to 40 years measuring 
gages have also come into use in con-
sumer applications (e.g. motor vehicle 
and domestic appliance technology). 
Sensors – another term for measuring 
 detectors or measuring sensors – convert 
a physical or chemical (generally non-
electrical) variable F into an electrical 
variable E; this process often also takes 
place over further, non-electrical inter-
mediate stages. 

Basics and overview

Sensor, term/definition
The electrical sensor outputs are not only 
provided in the form of current and volt-
age, but are also available as current or 
voltage amplitudes, frequency, phases, 
pulse widths, and cycles or periods of an 
electrical oscillation, or as the electrical 
parameters, resistance, capacitance, and 
inductance. A sensor can be defined using 
the following equation:

Table 1 summarizes and compares the 
 various fields of application for sensors. 
Figure 1 provides an overview of the 
 abundance of electronic vehicle systems 
 already on the market. Undoubtedly,  
this number will increase immensely  
in the years to come.

These model parameters are generally 
stored in a programmable, nonvolatile 
memory component (PROM) in the digital 
processes for conditioning sensor signals, 
which have come to dominate. By contrast 
with the conventional analog compensa-
tion of influencing variables, it is not only 
roughly linearly acting influences that may 
be corrected, but also strongly nonlinear 
processes that can be corrected success-
fully. Another significant advantage of this 
type of calibration, which takes place over 
a purely electrical connection, is that each 
sensor may easily be maintained under 
 operating conditions during the calibra-
tion phase.

▶ Concept of the smart sensor

 
In a somewhat more general form, 
 intelligent sensors (smart sensors)  
may be defined as follows:
Intelligent sensors, sometimes also 
known as integrated sensors or sensors 
with specific local electronics, allow the 
(static or dynamic) accuracy inherent  
in a sensor to be exploited by means of 
(generally digital) microelectronics to  
a far greater degree than conventional 
sensors. The sensor information, in par-
ticularly the complex information from 
multisensor structures, can be com-
pressed here by local further processing, 
that is to say, it is brought to a higher 
level (than the sensor alone is capable  
of providing), without a multiplicity of 
external connections being required  
for this.

210  |  Automotive sensors  |  Basics and overview

There is no clear determination as to 
whether sensors can already incorporate  
a part of the signal processing or not; it is, 
however, recommended, for example, that 
no distinction be made between elemen-
tary sensor, sensor cell, or the like and  
an integrated sensor.

Calibration process 
A smart sensor is generally programmed 
or calibrated, in a procedure correspond-
ing to the calibration of conventional ana-
log sensors, in three steps with the help of 
an external computer (host) (Fig. 4):

Recording the actual value 
The host computer systematically varies 
both the measured variable xe and the 
 influencing variable(s) y, thus setting a 
specific number of relevant and represen-
tative operating points. The smart sensor 
here passes the, still uncorrected, raw sig-
nals xa* to it. The host, however, is simulta-
neously also receiving the “true” values xe 
and y from substantially more accurate 
reference sensors. The host computes the 
correction values necessary by comparing 
these two values, and interpolates these 
corrections over the full measuring range.

Saving the correction parameters 
The host computer calculates the model 
parameters for the specific sensor from 
the data previously obtained, e.g. for a lin-
ear characteristic curve course and saves 
these to the smart sensor’s PROM. In a 
check process, these parameters may also 
first be emulated in the host computer’s 
RAM before they are finally burnt to the 
nonvolatile memory of the smart sensor.  
If characteristic curves are approximated 
with higher order polynomials, program 
maps (look-up tables) may also be stored 
in the smart sensor to avoid protracted 
computing processes. The solution of sav-
ing a coarse-grid program map in conjunc-
tion with a simple linear interpolation 
 between the data points (example shown 
in Fig. 5) has also proved very useful.

Operating phase
The smart sensor is now disconnected 
from the host computer and is in a position 
itself to calculate the measured variable xe 
with very low error thanks to the stored 
model data. It is able to pass the value to a 
connected control unit in digital, bit-serial 
or even analog form (e.g. pulse-width 
modulated), for instance. The measured 
variable can also be distributed digitally  
to further control units via a bus interface.

This process can, unlike conventional laser 
calibration, in principle also be repeated if 
an erasable PROM is used. This is a partic-
ular advantage in the development phase 
of sensors.

Example: two-dimensional data point-
program map s (Tn, qm) of a smart sen-
sor for the measurement of a travel s: 

For a highly precise evaluation of the 
sensor, which operates using variable 
inductance, its natural characteristic 
curve and its temperature sensitivity 
are each approximated using 5th order 
polynomials. As a frequency-determin-
ing element of a very simple oscillator 
circuit, it outputs the period duration T 
as an uncorrected output signal. As a 
sensor model for the measuring travel s, 
an outline program map embracing only 
32 x 64 = 2,048 example-specific values 
sn,m is stored (in the PROM) along with 
a simple interpolation algorithm (in the 
ROM), instead of a total of 36 poly-
nomial coefficents and a protracted 
polynomial evaluation. Should a signal T 
occur between these data points Tn and 
Tn+1 in conjunction with a temperature q 
between data points qm and qm+1, 
the sensor interpolates in two dimen-
sions in accordance with the mapping 
between the benchmark figures stored 
“error-free” s1,...s4 and thus the mea-
sured value s(T, q) sought is determined 
as the result of interpolation.

Automotive applications

With increasing demands on all functions 
in the vehicle, the control and regulation 
functions that were previously imple-
mented by mechanical means have, in the 
last 40 years, successively been replaced 
by electronic devices (ECU, Electronic 
Control Unit). This has necessarily caused 
high demand for sensors and actuators 
with which these electronic control units 
can, on the one hand determine the rele-
vant states of the vehicle, and on the other 
hand, actually influence these states.  
Over this period, the vehicle industry has 
become one of the, previously unprece-
dented, drivers of the development of sen-
sors that could be manufactured in large 
numbers. 

Whereas at the outset they still were of 

electromechanical or macromechanical 
form of some sort, the trend beginning  
in the 80s was for miniaturization, with

semiconductor methods (batch process-
ing) for the manufacture of high use sen-
sors. For a while, sensors originating in 
 hybrid technology using thick-film tech-
niques also played a not insubstantial role. 
These are still used in isolated applications 
today, e.g. in the wafer-shaped Lambda 
 oxygen sensors and high temperature 
 sensors for the exhaust line. 

Where temperature and magnetic field 
sensors could initially still be designed in 
circuit-like structures and be produced in 
batches, this trend increased as it became 
possible also to micromachine silicon in 
many various ways in two or three dimen-
sions, and also to connect them, even in 
multiple layers, very soundly by very 
 efficient methods.

Where the technologies of the electronic 

semiconductor circuits were practically 
exclusively based on silicon as the base 
material, quite different materials and 
technologies played a not insignificant  
role in sensors. Thus, for instance, quartz 
can also be micromachined using anisotro-
pic etching techniques, and unlike silicon 
also has very advantageous piezoelectric 
properties. III-V semiconductors such as 

gallium arsenide (GaAs) have a substan-
tially greater operating temperature range 
than silicon, which can be very advanta-
geous, particularly at some points in the 
vehicle. Thin metallic layers are very  
well suited to the manufacture of precise 
strain-gage resistors, accurate tempera-
ture sensors and magnetic field-dependent 
resistors.

With silicon it is possible also to inte-
grate the electronics monolithically with 
the sensor. This technique has lost its im-
portance – with a few exceptions (e.g. Hall-
effect ICs) – because of the generally very 
different number and type of process steps 
and also because of the inflexibility associ-
ated with this. Hybrid integration technol-
ogies in the tightest of spaces as a rule lead 
to substantially more cost effective, but 
functionally equivalent solutions (Fig. 7).

While the development of sensors was ini-
tially concentrated almost exclusively on 
systems inside the detail in the drivetrain, 
the suspension and the body and driving 
safety, the direction of sensing of newer 
developments is increasingly named to the 
outside and to the area close to and further 
from the vehicle:

 ▶ Ultrasound sensors detect obstacles on 
parking and will even allow automatic 
parking in the foreseeable future, per-
haps in combination with other sensors.
 ▶ Near-range radar scans the area around 
the vehicle to detect objects that proba-
bly could cause a collision, to gain time 
and to prime safety systems before a 
 collision occurs (precrash sensors).
 ▶ Imaging sensors can not only detect 

traffic signs and send them to the driv-
er’s display, but also detect the edge  
of the carriageway, warn the driver of 
any hazardous deviation and, where 
 required, in the long term also permit 
automatic driving. In combination with 
infrared beams and a screen in the driv-
er’s field of vision, IR-sensitive imaging 
sensors could permit long distance 
 observation of the carriageway, even  
at night (night vision) or in foggy con-
ditions.

 ▶ Long-range radar sensors observe the 
carriageway for 150 m in front of the 
 vehicle, even in poor visibility, to adapt 
the driving speed to vehicles ahead and, 
in the longer term, also to support auto-
matic driving.

As part of the vehicle’s peripheral equip-
ment, the sensors and actuators form the 
vehicle’s interface to its complex drive, 
braking, chassis, and bodywork functions, 
as well as to the vehicle guidance and navi-
gation functions and the (usually digital) 
ECUs which operate as the processing 
units (Fig. 8). An adapter circuit is gener-
ally used to convert the sensor’s signals 
into the standardized form (measuring 
chain, measured-data registration system) 
required by the control unit.

These customer-specific adapter circuits 
are tailor-made for specific sensors and 
are available in integrated design and in  
a wide variety of versions. They represent 
a quite substantial and very valuable addi-
tion to the sensors described here, without 
which their use would not be possible, and 
the measuring accuracy of which is, prop-
erly said, only defined in conjunction with 
these.

The vehicle can be regarded as a highly 

complex process, or control loop, which 
can be influenced by the sensor informa-
tion from other processing units (control 
units), as well as from the driver using his/
her controls. Display units keep the driver 
informed about the status and the process 
as a whole. 

214  |  Automotive sensors  |  Details of the sensor market

Micromechanical processes for the pro-
duction of sensors are continually being 
further developed in tandem with the 
semiconductor processes. These compa-
nies do not, however, have any specific 
know-how in the area of specification, 
testing and packaging appropriately  
for the vehicle.

 ▶ Special, generally medium-sized manu-

facturers of sensors, who do not produce 
semiconductor circuits, but have gener-
ally chosen just a few sensor types as 
their product to supply the sensor mar-
ket overall or just preferred branches 
such as the vehicle market.

 ▶ Large vehicle suppliers and system man-
ufacturers (e.g. Bosch) or large subsid-
iaries of vehicle manufacturer who have 
specialized in the needs and support of 
their mother groups. Here too, since the 
introduction of electronics in the vehi-
cle, experience has been gained with the 
production of semiconductor and hybrid 
circuits in close collaboration with semi-
conductor manufacturers (process de-
velopment, licensing). Thanks to system 
knowledge, it has been possible to build 
up comprehensive know-how in the 
field of specification, testing and pack-
aging techniques appropriate for the 
 vehicle.

Details of the sensor market

The proportion of value added in the vehi-
cle by the electrical and electronics sys-
tems is currently around 26 %. Nowadays, 
practically every second sensor is fitted 
into a vehicle, with annual growth rates 
that are, in some cases, still in double 
 digits. Since the start of the 90s, microme-
chanical and microsystem-technical sen-
sors have taken a rapidly increasing share, 
which amounted to about a third in 2005. 
Unlike in the general sensor market, 
 Europe has a current market share of  
41 % of the vehicle sensors sector and 
Bosch is the world market leader; this has 
clearly surpassed America with a share  
of just 34 %. The total market for sensors 
for vehicle applications is expected  
to grow from US$ 8.88 billion in 2005 to 
around US$ 11.35 billion in 2010, that is  
by a total of 28 % (Fig. 9).

There are typically three groups of compa-
nies offering sensors for use in the vehicle:
 ▶ The semiconductor industry: sensors 
from semiconductor manufacturing 
originated here with the application  
of a few process steps. They serve the 
entire sensor market including the auto-
motive industry and have an efficiently-
operating sales and distribution system.

Automotive sensors  |  Features of vehicle sensors  |  215

Features of vehicle sensors 

While general sensors are being developed 
for as broad a user group as possible and 
in multilevel measuring ranges, often with-
out the manufacturer being aware of the 
application, vehicle sensors are generally 
specified and optimized for a special ap-
plication. They are a part of a system and 
are often not freely available in the trade. 
Their development generally takes longer 
than that of commercial sensors, not just 
because of the enhanced demands. It is 
more associated with the development  
of the system and generally lasts as long  
as this does, as the sensor specification 
can still change until system development 
is concluded.

The high thrust for innovation in systems 
for the automobile sector very often com-
pels the development of new sensor tech-
nologies or significant extensions of their 
specifications. Figure 10 shows the typical 
development phases that vehicle sensors 
pass through at the supplier’s works. 

The development process begins natu-
rally with the system idea originating with 
the vehicle manufacturer or the supplier. 
The initial task is to make a selection of the 
measured variables required, whether or 
not this is feasible. At this stage, the sen-
sors’ function is simulated as part of the 
systems engineers’ usual system simula-
tion and a first specification is drawn up.  
If it is possible to use a sensor technology 
that has already been introduced, the 
wishes in respect of the sensors are passed 
directly to product development or the 
producing area. If no technology is imme-
diately available, sensor and technology 
experts are gradually increasingly in-
cluded in research and advanced develop-
ment. Here, the first laboratory prototypes 
can be created using known technologies 
and often with the help of external part-
ners. These prototypes can then be passed 
to product development for initial tests. 

If no sensor principles are known for the 
requirements set, research will be started 
into new procedures and methods for the 
measurement of the variables required. 
This phase is one of fundamental research 
which ultimately also supplies new initial 
technology prototypes. This procedure 
can repeat itself recursively until a prom-
ising solution which can then be sent to 
product development is found. It is not 
unusual for this development loop to be 
repeated again in full or for a different 
measured variable to be selected.

Five distinct phases are generally identi-
fied in the development of a completely 
new sensor, just as with other electronic 
products (Table 2). While prototypes and 
A-samples mostly still come from advance 
development or research, B- and C-samples

If recursions are necessary in difficult 
 developments, there can easily also be a

Sensor classification

Sensors can be classified and grouped 
 according to very different points of view. 
They can be classified with regard to their 
use in the vehicle as follows:

Assignment and application
 ▶ Functional sensors (pressure, air-mass 
flow) mainly used for open and closed-
loop control assignments

 ▶ Sensors for safety (passenger protec-
tion: airbag, ESP) and security (theft-
 deterrence feature)

 ▶ Sensors for vehicle monitoring  

(on-board diagnosis (OBD), fuel-con-
sumption and wear parameters) and  
for driver/passenger information

Characteristic curve type
 ▶ Continuous linear curves (Fig. 11a) are 
used mainly for control assignments 
covering a wide measuring range.  
Linear curves are also distinguished by 
uncomplicated testing and calibration.
 ▶ Continuous nonlinear curves (Fig. 11b) 

are often used for the closed-loop  
control of a measured variable across  
a very restricted measuring range  
(e.g. exhaust-gas control to l = 1, vehicle 
spring-deflection level). When, for in-
stance, a constant permissible deviation 
relative to the measured value is de-
manded throughout the complete mea-
suring range (e.g. HFM air-mass  meter), 
curves which feature both pronounced 
non- linearity and a special shape  
(e.g. logarithmic) are at an  advantage.
 ▶ Such two-step curves (possibly even 

 featuring hysteresis, Fig. 11d) are used 
for limit-value monitoring in such cases 
where remedial measures are easy to 
apply when the limits are reached.  
If remedial measures are more difficult, 
then multi-step curves (Fig. 11c) can be 
used for an earlier warning.

Type of output signal 
Sensors may also be distinguished by the 
type of output signals (Fig. 13):

For instance, the signal is bound to be 
discontinuous if it is digital and issued  
in bit-serial form.

Analog signals
 ▶ Current/voltage, or a corresponding 

 amplitude

 ▶ Frequency/period duration
 ▶ Pulse duration/pulse duty factor

Discrete output signal
 ▶ Two-step (binary coded).
 ▶ Multi-step, with irregular steps (analog

 ▶ Multi-step equidistant (analog or digital 

 ▶ A further distinction must be made, as is 
represented in Figure 12 in a systematic 
overview of the determined, i.e. nonran-
dom (stochastic) signal – as to whether 
the signal is permanently available at  
the sensor output (continuously) or only 
at discrete intervals (discontinuously).

218  |  Automotive sensors  |  Error types and tolerance requirements

Error types and
tolerance requirements

The deviation of the actual characteristic 
curve of a sensor from its reference char-
acteristic curve is designated its error e. 
It is best stated in relation to the input 
range y (measured variable) and not to 
the output range x (output signal):
(3)  e = yindicated - ytrue

 

 yindicated = indicated value for the mea-
sured variable
 ytrue = ideal value, setpoint value for 
the measured variable (is determined 
with a measuring sensor that is more 
accurate than the sensor being exam-
ined by at least 1 class)

The amount of the deviation represents,  
as shown in Figure 14, the absolute 
 error eabs (unit as measured variable). 
 Related to the true measured value ytrue, 
this becomes the relative error (% of read-

Assuming a generally desirable linear

acteristic curve and

 ▶ The production scatter of the tempera-

ture sensitivity

The deviations referred to are exclusively 
systematic or terministic errors which, by 
contrast with random (stochastic) errors, 
are well defined, foreseeable and, as a mat-
ter of principle, correctable, and are also 
for the most part more or less precisely 
corrected.

The non-correctable, stochastic errors 

include, for example,
 ▶ Drift (low and higher frequency back-

ground noise) and
 ▶ The effects of aging

In the specification of a sensor, the total 
error in the new state and after aging is 
prescribed in the product specifications  
by means of a tolerance graph (Fig. 16). 
Sometimes, however the permissible indi-
vidual error shares such as the offset,  
lead and linear deviations are additionally 
specified.

Strict metrology teaching states that,  
in the case of systematic errors, the sum  
of the amounts of the individual errors 
must be assumed as the total error (these 
may add up in the worst case). In the case 
of stochastic errors, statistical addition, 
which calculates the total error as the root 
of the sum of squares of the individual er-
rors, is permitted. As statistical addition 
leads to a smaller total error, it is, however, 
often also applied to the systematic errors 
in a less strict configuration:

Failure rate
The operational reliability of a sensor is  
a purely statistical quantity and, as with 
any component, is characterized by its 
failure rate l, which is stated in 1/h, %/h 
or ppm/h. Here l is determined with a 
large number of parts. If it is wished to 
 determine approximately the failure rate 
with a number N (< 40) of sensors that is 
not too great, it is possible to observe the 
failure behavior of this random sample 
 under operating conditions until, after a 
 finite time, all the parts have failed. If this 
observation is begun at time t0 and if the 
inventory of parts remaining at a later 
point ti is identified as B(ti), then a good 
approximation for the failure rate l is the 
failure quota q:
 
B(ti) – B(ti+1)
(6)  q(Dti, ti) =  ––––––––––––––––––        Failure quota
Dti · B(ti)
 
 

         where Dti = ti+1 - ti 

 

 

 

 

ti are the times at which individual parts 
or several parts fail (Fig. 17). The ratio of 
the current inventory of parts to the initial 
inventory of parts is known as the relative 
inventory BR:

With a very large number of parts (N → ∞), 
the survival probability R(t) at the, here 
now continuously variable, time t corre-
sponds to this. The failure rate is calcu-
lated here for a large number (in practice 
N ≈ 2,000) of sensors as a percentage varia-
tion on the survival probability R per unit 
of time dt as:

The definition of the failure rate l 
 demands a failure criterion:
 ▶ Complete failure
 ▶ Partial failure
 ▶ Sudden failure (sudden change in a 

 ▶ Drift failure (gradual change in a 

Furthermore, it is absolutely necessary to 
specify under what operating conditions 
the failure rate defined in this way is to  
be understood. Particularly in the case  
of electrical components such as sensors, 
for example, it is necessary to distinguish 
between true, active operating time 
(switched on state) and service life in the 
sense of pure storage time. Any statement 
of a failure rate without this additional in-
formation is worthless.

Failure rates are normally determined 
using time-acceleration methods. The ac-
celeration factors are achieved here by ex-
posing the sensors to enhanced operating 
conditions. A high degree of experience is 
required in order to apply time accelera-
tion methods that truly reflect reality.

The concept of the mean service life TM is 
also used to characterize the reliability of  
a sensor. A good approximation of this can 
be calculated from a random sample from 
the sum of the individual service lives Ti:

chemical and electrical ambient influences 
must be provided (packaging, passivation). 
On the other hand, it is costly to create op-
erational reliability by testing alone, i.e. to 
exclude early failures through premature 
aging.

It is sensible to provide monitoring and 
diagnostic capabilities for sensors in com-
plex systems (e.g. signal range check, etc.), 
so that any failures occurring may be de-
tected in good time. In an emergency, a 
sensor’s function can here be temporarily 
replaced by other measured variables or 
sensible fixed values (limp-home mode, 
back up). A sensor-less, often purely me-
chanical, limp-home mode can be pro-
vided. For instance, should the accelera-
tor-pedal sensor failure in a diesel vehicle, 
the vehicle could also be driven slowly 
back for repair under regulated idle speed 
alone (limp home).

Where reliability must be guaranteed 
with a probability bordering on certainty 
(e.g. for sensors in electronic braking and 
steering systems), redundancy, i.e. provi-
sion of multiple parts, is generally the 
means used. Dual redundancy of a sensor 
of the same type here only permits failure 
detection for the case of widely different 
indications, whereas triple redundancy 
with 2 from 3 analysis additionally still 
supplies a correct measured value. Here, 
however, care must be taken to provide not 
only redundancy of the sensors, but other 
essential parts such as the power supply, 
signal evaluation and transmission means 
must also be correspondingly redundant, 
as otherwise the probability of simultane-
ous failure increases. It is often also advis-
able to provide sensor redundancy in dif-
ferent technologies.

The failure rate of a product against time 
shows a typical bathtub pattern (Fig. 18). 
At the start, the failure rate is somewhat 
high because of early failures, it then 
passes through a longer, relatively low, 
horizontal range, then to rise again drasti-
cally towards the end of the service life 
(aging and wear effects). In the case of sen-
sors for which high operational reliability 
is demanded, an attempt is made to avoid 
the elevated failure rate at the start by 
sorting out the early failures by pre-aging, 
e.g. by conditioning at higher tempera-
tures (“burn in”). Early failures are basi-
cally nothing other than manufacturing 
defects that have not been recognized.

Table 3 gives some examples of permis-

sible failure rates l applicable for the 
 vehicle. The ppm values given relate to  
a period of 10 years, or alternatively to 
150,000 km covered, if this is completed  
in a shorter time. Where the sensors are 
given a flat rate of <10 ppm, it means that 
in 10 years, only fewer than 10 of 1 million 
sensors may fail. This value is, however, 
substantially lower for sensors in passen-
ger protection systems.

Measures for increasing reliability
The best method for ensuring high quality 
is to engineer and design in reliability.  
This means that as soon as the sensor is 
designed, correspondingly durable mate-
rials must be selected and solid protective 
measures against anticipated mechanical,

Main requirements, trends 

The vehicle sensors customized for the re-
quirements of special electronic systems  
in the vehicle, unlike the universal sensors 
conventionally found in the market, are 
subject to five strict requirements (Fig. 19) 
which must be fulfilled by development 
and to which the most  important develop-
ment trends also correspond. 

Low manufacturing costs
Electronic systems in modern vehicles eas-
ily contain up to 150 sensors. Compared  
to other sectors of sensor application,  
this abundance forces a radical reduction 
in costs. The target costs – typically in the 
range of € 1 to 30 – are here often less than 
one-hundredth of those for conventional 
sensors of the same capacity. Naturally, 
particularly with the introduction of a new 
technique or technology, the costs are gen-
erally on a falling learning curve, starting 
from a higher level.

Development trends
Automated manufacturing processes 
(Fig. 20) are largely used, working to a high 
yield. This means that each process step  
is always executed for a large number of 

sensors simultaneously. For example, 
semiconductor sensors are manufactured  
using “batch processing” in which 100 to 
1,000 sensors are manufactured simulta-
neously on a single silicon wafer. On the 
other hand, such manufacturing equip-
ment is only an economic proposition 
when correspondingly large numbers of 
sensors are produced. These quantities 
sometimes exceed an automotive-industry 
supplier’s own in-house requirements,  
and can typically often be between 1 and 
10 million per year. Here, the high num-
bers of sensors needed by the automotive 
industry has played an unprecedented and 
revolutionary role, and set completely new 
standards.

High reliability
In accordance with their assignments, 
 vehicle sensors are subdivided into the 
 following reliability classes, given in 
 descending order of severity:
 ▶ Steering, brake, passenger protection
 ▶ Engine/drivetrain, chassis/tires
 ▶ Comfort and convenience, diagnosis, 
 information, and theft deterrence

Automotive sensors  |  Main requirements, trends  |  223

The requirements on the highest class  
here easily match the high reliability val-
ues familiar from aerospace applications. 
To some extent, they demand similar mea-
sures, such as the use of the best materials, 
redundant componentry, self-monitoring, 
(short-term) backup power supply, multi-
ple programming of critical decision-mak-
ing algorithms.

Development trends
Appropriate design measures guarantee 
built-in reliability. For instance, this neces-
sitates the use of reliable, top-quality com-
ponents and materials, coupled with rug-
ged and well-proven techniques and engi-
neering. And furthermore, an effort is 
made to achieve a consistent integration  
of the systems to avoid connection points 
which may be broken and are at risk of 
failure. This is possible, for instance,  
with radio-scanned sensors based on the 
antenna-coupled SAW (Surface Acoustic 
Wave) elements which do without wiring 
completely. If necessary, redundant sensor 
systems are fitted.

Severe operating conditions
Like practically no other breed, vehicle 
sensors are exposed to extreme stresses 
because of where they are fitted, and must 
withstand all kinds of aggression:
 ▶ Mechanical (vibration, shock)
 ▶ Climatic (temperature, moisture)
 ▶ Chemical (e.g. spray, salt mist, fuel, 

 engine oil, electrolyte)

 ▶ Electromagnetic (incident radiation, 
line-conducted interference, excess 
voltages, polarity reversal)

It is this trend of using sensors immedi-
ately at the site where the measurement  
is taken in order to exploit the benefits 
 associated with this which itself leads  
to the requirements being considerably 
cranked up. 

Figure 21 illustrates this problem on  
a sensor which might be a temperature 
sensor, speed sensor, flow-rate sensor  
or concentration sensor, for instance.  
The sensor cannot in the slightest always 
be surrounded by a hermetic protective 
sleeve. Although this sleeve could offer 
rough protection for the measurement of 
temperature, flow rates and concentration, 
it must permit more or less  direct contact 
between the sensor and the generally very 
aggressive monitored medium (an excep-
tion to this is the inertia sensor). Some-
times, thin, but very resistant, passivation 
layers are permissible on the sensor. 

The form of the plug-in sensor demands 

a permanently tight seat of the mount in 
the associated wall (inner packaging, outer 
packaging). The sensor may be connected 
to the electronic control units via a fixed 
housing plug or also, as illustrated, via a 
plug flexibly fastened with a length of ca-
ble (e.g. ABS wheel-speed sensor). Here, 
too, there are three critical electrical con-
nection points that absolutely must be pro-
tected against conductive fluids and corro-
sion: the inner connection on the sensor 
element, the connection of the cable tail 
and finally the connection of the partially 
shielded cable to the external plug connec-

tion. If the seal is inadequate, it is only a 
question of time until corrosive liquids 
penetrate from the external connector  
into the internal sensor terminal.

The plug-in connection itself must be 
sufficiently tight overall, that no shunts 
form at the sensor output. The cable itself 
must retain its flexibility and tightness 
 after many years of operation under the 
most adverse conditions.

Separable plug-in connections in the 
 vehicle unfortunately still represent one  
of the most frequent causes of failure. 
Wireless signal connections (e.g. infrared 
light or radio) could break down this prob-
lem in the longer view, especially if the 
sensors were even to have a wireless 
 energy supply (autonomous sensors).

The costs of these indispensable tech-
nologies complementary to the sensors 
 often exceed those of the actual sensor 
 element many times over. They constitute 
the actual value of an vehicle sensor, not 
only in terms of cost, but also in terms of 
function.

Development trends
Protective measures against the stresses 
referred to demand a very high degree of 
specific know-how in the field of sensor 
packaging. 
 ▶ Passivation and connecting techniques 
 ▶ Sealing and joining techniques
 ▶ EMC protective measures
 ▶ Low-vibration installation 
 ▶ Service life test and simulation methods
 ▶ The use of resistant materials, etc. 

Furthermore, detailed knowledge of the 
loading to which the sensor will be sub-
jected at the particular installation point  
is required. It is often forgotten that the 
quality of a sensor stands and falls with 
 total competence with these protective 
measures.

Fiber-optic sensors in which the light 
guided in the optical fibers (glass, plastic) 
can be modified as a function of the mea-
sured variable are particularly immune to 
electromagnetic interference. This is true 
up to the point at which the optical signals 
are converted back into electrical signals. 
If these are to be used in the future, there 
will have to be some development work 
the provision of low-priced measuring 
 elements and the accompanying technolo-
gies. There are, for example, some very 
 interesting applications for this in the  
field of force measurement, e.g. in provid-
ing finger protection for electric power 
windows and sliding sunroofs (Fig. 22). 
 Sensors of this type have also been tested

Example of development: fiber-optic fin-
ger protection in power windows based 
on the microbending effect:
The light in an optical fiber is attenu-
ated proportionally to the corrugated 
distortion on the application of a force F 
transverse to the fiber (large measur-
ing effect), independently of where the 
force is applied or whether it is acting 
at a point or is distributed (distributed 
sensors).

Low-volume design
On the one side, the number of electronic 
systems in the vehicle continues to climb 
steadily. On the other, today’s vehicles are 
becoming more and more compact. These 
facts, together with the need to retain the 
high level of passenger-compartment com-
fort forces development to concentrate on 
an extreme space-saving designs. Further-
more, the increasing demand for further 
improvements in fuel economy mean that 
minimization of the vehicle’s weight is of 
prime importance.

Development trends
Widespread use is made of the familiar 
technologies applied in circuit engineering 
for the miniaturization of electronic com-
ponents:
 ▶ Film and hybrid technologies (deforma-
tion-dependent resistors, thermistors, 
and magnetoresistors); nanotechology
 ▶ Semiconductor technology (Hall-effect 

and temperature sensors)

 ▶ Surface and bulk micromechanical tech-
niques (silicon pressure, acceleration 
and yaw-rate sensors)

 ▶ Microsystem technology (combination 
of two and more microtechnologies  
such as microelectronics and micro-
mechanics, Fig. 23)

Micromechanical manufacturing refers  
on the one hand to dimensions in the µm-
range and tolerances in the sub-µ-range 
which cannot be achieved with conven-
tional machining methods. On the other 
hand, sensors which may have dimensions 
in the mm-range, but which are manufac-
tured with micromechanical methods, are 
also considered micromechanical (Fig. 24). 
We will discuss only the most well-known 
and important method here, anisotropic 
etching of silicon. This is the most impor-
tant method, because silicon is manufac-
tured to high precision and in large num-
bers at low cost, and is the most thor-
oughly researched and best known 
material. In addition, it offers the capabil-
ity of the monolithic integration of sensor 
and evaluation electronics. The etching 
speeds, which can be very different de-
pending on the crystal axis (1:100), with 
which suitable etching fluids such as  
KOH attack are exploited in this method  
(Fig. 25); some crystal faces, for instance, 
remain practically untouched, while other 
faces are  rapidly etched to some depth.

In conjunction with appropriate etching 

stop methods (doping, depletion layer) 
practically three-dimensional structures  
of the smallest dimensions may be pro-
duced to the highest precision in this way

27 First attempts at three-dimensional forming of silicon

(Figs. 26, 27). The problem of simultane-
ously integrating the circuit can be consid-
ered largely resolved, even if currently the 
associated circuit for most sensors is still 
made separately for reasons of a better 
yield and higher flexibility.

By contrast with bulk micromechanics, 
anisotropic, often wafer-depth etching has 
no role to play in surface micromechanics 
(SMM). SMM sensor structures are mostly 
built up additively on the surface of a sili-
con substrate (Figs. 28 and 29). Even if  
the dimensions of bulk silicon sensors  
are still mostly in the mm-range, those of 
SMM structures are an order of magnitude 
smaller (typically 100 µm), as a rule.

Frequently, mechanically indispensable 
parts are used simultaneously for enclos-
ing and even cooling (associated) sensors 
and electronics (e.g. microhybrid control 
unit as an add-on control unit to the VP44 
diesel distributor-type injection pump). 
This fusion of mechanical and electronic 
components known as mechatronics is 
coming more and more to the forefront  
in the search for cost and space savings.  
In the foreseeable future, practically all 
systems will operate on this basis.

Another example of a mechatronic sensor 
system is the Hall-effect speed sensor built 
into the wheel bearing. The addition of 
magnetic particles to the indispensable 
shaft seal in the bearing can even give it 
the function of the rotor or a pole wheel. 
The sensor benefits from excellent protec-
tion and encapsulation along with the high 
precision of the roller bearing and no lon-
ger needs any bias magnets. Finally, the 
Hall-effect technology allows installation 
in the very tight space within the bearing.

High accuracy
By comparison with the probes and sen-
sors used for instance in the processing 
 industry, with only a few exceptions (e.g. 
the air-mass meter), the accuracy demands 
made on vehicle sensors are relatively 
modest. Generally, the permissible devia-
tions are > 1 % of the measuring-range fi-
nal value. This applies in particular when 
considering the unavoidable effects of 
 aging. The permissible deviations are nor-
mally achieved by the application of com-
plex techniques to compensate for manu-
facturing tolerances, and to balance the 
 effective compensation measures used 
against interference. Particularly since  
the above-mentioned requirements have 
for the most part become achievable, con-
tinually more demanding and sophisti-
cated systems are imposing higher and 
higher demands in this sector.

Development trends
Initially, a tightening up of the tolerances 
in manufacture, and refinement of the cali-
bration and compensation techniques help 
in this regard. An important step forward 
here is the hybrid or monolithic integra-
tion of the sensor and signal electronics 
directly at the measuring point, even em-
bracing complex digital circuits such as 
analog/digital converters and microcom-
puters (Fig. 30). 

Such microsystems are also known as 
“intelligent sensors”. They take full advan-
tage of the sensor’s inherent accuracy,  
and offer the following features:
 ▶ Reduction of the load on the control unit
 ▶ Uniform, flexible, bus-compatible inter-

 ▶ Multiple application of sensors
 ▶ Use of smaller measuring effects and  
of radio frequency measuring effects 
(local amplification and demodulation)
 ▶ Correction of sensor deviations at the 

measuring point, and mutual calibration 
and compensation of sensor and elec-
tronics, is simplified and improved by

While simultaneously detecting and digi-

Local electronic circuitry necessitates the 
use of multi-sensor structures which use a

of highly complex facts and locally reduce 
these to their basic information content,  
as necessary. This applies in particular to 
imaging sensors which in future will play 
an ever increasing role in detecting the 
 situation inside and outside the vehicle.

Automotive sensors  |  Overview of the physical  effects for sensors  |  229

With a number of pressure sensors inte-
grated into the smallest of spaces, it is pos-
sible to not only increase the reliability  
of measurement, but also to reduce the, 
generally irregular, aging drift by applying 
mean-value generation. Individual failures 
(outliers) can also be detected and elimi-
nated. Sensors of this type are also known 
as soft sensors. If the individual sensor 
 elements are designed for differing mea-
suring ranges – and at the same time fea-
ture high overload capabilities (e.g. capaci-
tive) – such a sensor can be used to con-
siderably extend the high-acccuracy 
measuring range. Sensor structures of this 
type were developed and tested years ago, 
but have not been converted into 
 marketable products.

Overview of the physical 
 effects for sensors

The sensors are not classified here into a 
systematic structure by measuring effect, 
but rather by measured variable. For this 
reason, the most important physical ef-
fects or measuring concepts exploitable 
for measuring purposes will here only be 
reproduced in the form of a rough over-
view, which cannot be complete. Overlaps 
between the various categories are un-
avoidable. The table specifies principally 
the actual electrical effects; mechanical or 
fluid prior stages, such as strain springs 
(force), membranes (pressure), spring-
mass systems (acceleration), vibration sys-
tems (tuning forks) or even fixed and rotat-
ing turbine blades (flow) are not included.

Overview and selection

The various sensor technologies for ex-

are naturally closely bound up with the 
measuring principle. They will first be

duced induction coils (with electrical  
or magnetic conductors), eddy current 
and short-circuiting ring sensors

 materials, e.g. quartz, metal (LIGA tech-

The matrix shown in Figure 32 indicates 
which sensor technologies should be taken 
for various requirements. Thus, for in-

racy, it is appropriate to take a thin-film

Sensor measuring principles

There is a great number of sensors at 
work in motor vehicles. They act as the 
sensory organs of the vehicle and convert 
input variables into electrical signals. 
These signals are used in control and 
regulation functions by the control units 
in the engine-management, safety and 
comfort and convenience systems. Vari-
ous measuring concepts are applied, 
 depending on the task.

Position sensors

Characteristics
Position sensors record the widest variety 
of one or multi-dimensional travel and an-
gular positions (translational and rotary 
variables) in a wide variety of areas. This 
 includes gaps, distances, displacements,  
fill levels and even minor expansions – 
 anything that can be measured in meters 
and angles. 

In this sector of applications, activities 
have long since been directed at changing 
over to proximity or non-contacting sen-
sor principles. Such sensors are wear-free 
and thus have a longer service life as well 
as being more reliable. The costs involved 
though often force vehicle manufacturers 
to retain contacting sensor principles 
which still perform sufficiently well for 
many measuring tasks.

Position variables are “extensive mea-
sured variables”, the measured variable  
or the measuring range of which has  
a substantial influence on the size of the 
sensor (by comparison, pressure and tem-
perature, for instance are “intensive mea-
sured variables”). Sensors for extensive 
variables of medium and larger ranges 
(e.g. including flow and force sensors) are 
thus initially less suited to miniaturization 
on the one hand and hence for cost-effec-
tive mass production. As this is much less 
true for angular-position sensors than for 
travel sensors (the angle value does not 
depend on the radius or leg length), the 
former are clearly preferred in the vehicle.
In the case of extensive variables with  

a large measuring range, however, the 
 extensive variable can often be first con-
verted into an intensive variable, which 
can then be measured using microsensors. 
Thus flow measurement can be converted 
to flow density measurement (partial flow 
measurement, e.g. 1:100) where the flow 
tube becomes an essential component part 
of the sensor without which the sensor ul-
timately cannot be tested and calibrated.

tion by a reference mark detectable by the 
sensor, in case a fault should have occurred. 
This also takes account of the fact that the 
position of the crankshaft when the engine 
is started is not known; it must first rotate 
almost one revolution under the starter so 
that the reference mark is passed at least 
once. The crankshaft’s motion is also very 
monotonous, i.e. it is always pretty much 
smooth (without sudden changes) and is 
 always in one direction (that is forwards, 
and never backwards). You can thus be  
sure that no more than one revolution will 
ever be incorrectly  detected.

The disadvantages of an incremental 
 angle measurement cannot be absorbed  
if the engine starts immediately without 
being cranked, as is also the case with the 
steering angle. An absolute angle sensor 
for a 360° range is required here.

Potentiometer sensors
The wiper potentiometer, usually made as 
an angular-position sensor (Fig. 1), uses 
the correspondence between the length of 
a wire or film resistor (Cermet or conduc-
tive plastic) and its resistance value for 
measuring purposes. At present, this is 
still the lowest-priced travel/angular-posi-
tion sensor. The shape of the characteristic 
curve can be influenced by shaping the 
measuring track (or just sections of it).  

1 Principle of the wiper potentiometer

In the case of travel and distance sensors 
covering large measuring ranges (approxi-
mately 0.1 to 150 m), the measured vari-
able is converted into a pulse or phase 
runtime by means of wave-propagation 
sensors (sound and electromagnetic 
waves), which can then be easily measured 
electronically with relatively small trans-
ceiver devices. In the case of sound waves, 
however, the propagation medium (e.g. air) 
and the time standard required (e.g. oscil-
lating crystal) then become an essential 
component part of the measuring device.

Measured variables: overview
There are a large number of applications 
in which position represents the actual 
measured variable. This is shown in over-
view by Table 1. In other cases, the mea-
sured position or angle represents a differ-
ent measured variable (Table 2).

In practice, “incremental sensor systems” 
are also often referred to as angular-position 
sensors, even when they are used for mea-
suring rotational speed. These sensors are in 
reality not angular-position sensors. Since 
the increments (steps with which a given 
variable increases) which have to be mea-
sured with these sensors in order to measure 
the deflection angle must be counted with 
the correct preceding sign (in other words, 
added), these sensors are in reality not angu-
lar-position sensors. Due to the danger of the 
counter being falsified as a consequence of 
spurious pulses, such angular-position mea-
suring systems are only in limited use. Fixed, 
directly locatable reference marks only pro-
vide very little help in this dilemma. Another 
disadvantage of such angular-position mea-
suring systems is the fact that the absolute 
position is lost when the operating voltage is 
switched off. It is no use storing the final po-
sition in a non-volatile memory here, since 
most angular positions can also change me-
chanically when power has been removed  
(e.g. steering angle).

Although it is true that the crankshaft 
 angle is measured incrementally, this mea-
surement is recalibrated after each revolu-

The standard wiper connection is fur-
nished by a second contact track consist-
ing of the same material mounted on a low-
resistance substrate. The supply voltage is 
usually applied to the measurement track 
through low-resistance series resistors RV 
(these can also be used for calibration of 
zero point and progression-rate adjust-
ment) to protect against overloading.

Wear and falsification of measured val-
ues can be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the electrical loading of the pick-off as low 
as possible (IA < 1 mA) and by dust-proof 
and waterproof encapsulation. One of the 
prerequisites for low wear is the optimal 
friction pairing between the wiper and the 
conductor track. To this end, wipers can 
be of “spoon” or “scraper-shape” design, 
and one or more can be mounted. Brush-
shaped wipers are also in use.

A whole range of clear advantages are 
faced by a considerable number of serious 
disadvantages:

Magnetically inductive-type sensors
Of all the sensors using proximity and  
non-contacting principles for position 
measurement, the magnetic sensors have 
proved to be the most rugged and most in-
sensitive to interference. This applies in 
particular to those principles relying on al-
ternating current, in other words magneti-
cally inductive principles. Compared with 
a micromechanical sensor though, the coil 
configuration needed here requires far 
more space. This means therefore that 
there is no favorable possibility of redun-
dant (parallel measurement) design. Fur-
thermore, coil contacting is less favorable 
from the costs and reliability viewpoint.

Although there are a multitude of differ-

ent principles in use for this form of sen-
sor, only two have come to the forefront 
for motor vehicle applications. Regarding 
their operating concepts, these are very 
similar to each other. However, they are 
currently no longer in use in their macro-
mechanical version by Bosch for motor 
 vehicle sensors in new developments.

an effect upon the coil’s equivalent resis-
tance and its inductance. This is the result 
of the eddy currents generated in the disk 
(otherwise known as a spoiler) due to the 
increasing magnetic coupling. The disk’s 
position represents the measured travel s.
The generally high operating frequency 

(MHz range, a low-frequency feed would 
take up too much current because of the 
low coil inductance) requires a direct as-
signment of the electronics to the sensor 
or a shielded supply lead, which is gener-
ally not supportable. In order to convert 
the measuring effect into an electrical out-
put voltage, either the damping effect 
(equivalent resistance) or field-displace-
ment (inductance) principles can be ap-
plied. In the first (damping effect) case,  
a variable-amplitude oscillator can be 
used, and in the second a variable-fre-
quency oscillator or a constant frequency 
supplied inductive voltage divider (differ-
ential configuration).

There are many ways to adapt the eddy-
current principle to the measuring assign-
ment. It is suited both to the determination 
of large travel distances or angles (there 
has already been a practically production-
ready development, for the throttle valve 
and accelerator pedal, for instance) and 
also for very small variables (e.g. torque 
sensors). Because of the self-compensating 
properties, this principle generally only 
shows a very small temperature sensitivity 
over a wide temperature range. As eddy-
current sensors can also, in principle, be 
manufactured micromechanically, their fu-
ture use cannot be completely written off 
given their very advantageous properties. 
This sensor principle is, however, widely 
used in manufacturing and quality mea-
suring technology, for the precise detec-
tion of the smallest displacements/dis-
tances or for the measurement of layer 
thicknesses in the µm range.

Short-circuiting ring sensors
In contrast to eddy-current sensors, the  
coil of a short-circuiting ring sensor has a 
straight or curved U or E-shaped soft mag-
netic, (usually) laminated iron core (Fig. 7). 
The coil, or short-circuiting ring (“spoiler”), 
is of highly conductive material (copper or 
aluminum), and is located around one (or 
all) of the core limbs. Because of their iron 
core, sensors of this type have a far greater 
inductance than eddy-current sensors and 
also a far higher measuring effect because 
of the guidance of the magnetic flux being 
very concentrated by the iron core. This 
means that they operate well at low fre-
quencies, and do not necessarily require 
their signal electronics locally, that is di-
rectly on the sensor itself. The iron core 
also protects the measuring space between 
the core limbs very well against external in-
terference fields.

The alternating field generated in and 
around the iron core by the coil current I 
cannot pass through the short-circuiting 
ring, since the eddy currents in the short-
circuiting ring reduce it practically to zero.

Sensor measuring principles  |  Position sensors  |  237

Thus the eddy currents in the short-cir-
cuiting ring, acting like a “magnetic insula-
tor”, limit the extent of the magnetic flux F 
to the space between the coil and the 
short-circuiting ring (hence its other name 
of shading ring) and thus make it depen-
dent on the position x of the short-circuit-
ing ring F = F(x). 

Inductance is defined:
L = F/I 

 

(1) 

This is why the position x of the short-cir-
cuiting ring also directly influences the in-
ductance L of the field coil. The relation-
ship L = L(x) shows a good linear fit over 
a wide domain. Virtually the entire length 
of the sensor can be utilized for measure-
ment purposes. A mechanically tight guid-
ance of the short-circuiting ring is not nec-
essary here.

The mass of the short-circuiting ring to 
be moved is very low. Shaping the gap be-
tween coil and limb has an effect upon the 
shape of the characteristic curve: reducing 
the gap towards the end of the measuring 
range further improves the already good 
linearity. Operation is generally in the 5 to 
50 kHz range, depending on material and 
structural shape. This sensor can also be 
used in very severe operating conditions, 
for instance on diesel fuel-injection pumps 
(Figs. 8, 9).

The cores are laminated (e.g. NiFe plate, 
0.2 mm thick) because of the alternating 
current operation. To achieve the necessary 
mechanical stability to keep the plates sta-
ble under acceleration, they are not only 
bonded in the normal fashion, but also in-
terlocked. To this end, the laminations are 
given a knobbly pattern in selected places 
which can be used to connect the lamina-
tions together before soft annealing (just 
like LEGO bricks), without interfering too 
much in the electrical insulation from lami-
nation to lamination required.

The half-differential short-circuiting 
ring sensor with moving measuring ring 
and fixed reference short-circuiting ring is 
very accurate; it is evaluated as an induc-
tive voltage divider (analysis of the induc-
tances L1/L2, or (L1 – L2)/(L1 + L2) or even as 
a frequency determining element of an os-
cillating circuit to generate a frequency 
analog signal (very interference-proof, 
easy to digitize). 

Applications
Examples for short-circuiting ring sensors:
 ▶ Rack-travel sensors for measuring the 
control-rack setting on in-line diesel  
injection pumps (Fig. 8)

 ▶ Angular-position sensors in the in-

jected-fuel quantity actuators of diesel 
distributor-type injection pumps

Figure 9 shows the structure of a half-dif-
ferential short-circuiting ring sensor for 
diesel distributor-type injection pumps.  
A sensor coil and a reference coil are at-
tached to each leg of the core. As the alter-
nating current transmitted by the control 
unit permeates the coils, it creates alter-
nating magnetic fields. The reference 
short-circuiting ring is fixed in position, 
while the measuring short-circuiting ring 
is attached to the control-collar shaft (ad-
justment angle w). As the measuring short-
circuiting ring moves along, the magnetic 
flux changes and the voltage across the 
coil changes, since the control unit main-
tains the current constant (load-indepen-
dent current). An evaluation circuit forms 
the ratio of the output voltage UA to the 
measurement inductance L1 to the refer-
ence voltage URef to the reference induc-
tance L2. It is proportional to the excursion 
of the measuring short-circuiting ring and 
can be evaluated by the control unit.

Sensors with rotatable alternating fields
With alternating current of the angular fre-
quency v fed coils or coil-like structures 
(such as meandering conductor track 
structures) two or more pole alternating 
fields structures may be arranged either  
in a circle or even linearly. These pole 
structures with fixed pole pitch can be 
 displaced in relation to a generally fixed 
set of receiver coils having the same pole 
pitch, by the movement of the system to be 
measured, either rotary or translatorial. 
Here the amplitudes of the receiver signals 
are changing with the movement in a sinu-
soidal pattern. If the receiver coils are dis-
placed in relation to one another by a spe-
cific portion of the pole pitch T (e.g. T/4 or 
T/3), the sinus pattern is phase-shifted by 
a corresponding angle (e.g. by 90° or 120°). 
The voltages arise as follows, for instance:
(1) 
(2) 
 
 

u1 = U?sinw?sinvt
u2 = U?sin(w - 90°)?sinvt 
     = U?cosw?sinvt

or even:
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 

u1 = U?sinw
u1 = U?sin(w - 120°)?sinvt
u1 = U?sin(w - 240°)?sinvt

After rectification, the angle of rotation a 
can be calculated with great precision 
from these voltages. The sensors prefera-
bly made as angle sensors identified in 
classical measurement technology as syn-
chro, resolver or even inductosyn methods 
function in this way.

In a simple bipolar arrangement, the 
electrical phase angle also corresponds 
 directly to the mechanical angle of rota-
tion a. In an arrangement of n pole pairs, 
the mechanical full angle w = 2p is con-
verted into a phase displacement of 
a = n?2p, so that the phase displacement a 
corresponds only to an angle of rotation  
of only w/n, which considerably enhances 
the resolution of the measuring system. 
However, the unambiguity of the measure-
ment signal must be restored by additional 
means, such as a simple angle sensor,  
in larger measuring ranges.

Hella sensor
The angle sensor developed by Hella  
does not strictly correspond to any of the 
methods described above, but is most simi-
lar to the inductosyn method. Figure 10 
shows the sensor with a 6-count pole struc-
ture (n = 6), for instance, which electrically 
seen converts an angle of rotation of w = 60° 
into a phase displacement of the signal am-
plitudes of a = 360°. All the conductor track 
structures required are applied to multi-
layer PCBs, at least in the case of the fixed 
part (stator). The rotor may also be made  
as a stamped part, if necessary, either free-
standing or mounted on a plastic carrier 
(hot stamping).

A circular conductor track loop is made 
on the stator. This induces an eddy current 
at an operating frequency of 20 MHz in a 
closed meandering loop of approximately 
the same outside diameter on the rotor. 

Sensor measuring principles  |  Position sensors  |  239

This eddy current naturally generates a 
secondary magnetic field, just like the 
exciter loop, which superimposes itself on 
the excitation field in the sense that it at-
tempts to eliminate it. If the track on the 
rotor were only a circular conductor track 
congruent with the stator loop instead of 
the meandering track, this would simply 
extinguish the primary field to a great ex-
tent. The meandering structure, however, 
creates a resulting multi-pole field which 
can be rotated with the rotor and the total 
flux of which is also naturally almost zero.

This multi-pole alternating field is 

sensed by concentric receiver coils or me-
anders of practically identical form located 
on the stator. These are offset within a pole 
pitch (of e.g. 60°) by 1/3 each, i.e. electri-
cally in their signal amplitude by 120° each 
(Fig. 10b). The receiver coils however ex-
tend over all n pole pairs (series circuit) 
and use the sum of all pole fields.

According to Figure 10c, the receiver coils 
are connected in a star connection. Their 
signals are sent to an ASIC to determine 
the electrical phase angle a or mechani-
cal angle of rotation w, which applies the 
necessary (sign-correct) rectification, 
selection and ratio formation. A version 
ASIC 1 receives the digital control signals 
necessary for this from an adjacent mi-
crocontroller. A different version ASIC 2 
is, however, also capable of operating the 
sensor completely independently (on a 
stand-alone basis). The ASICS also permit 
an end-of-line calibration of the mechani-
cal and electrical tolerances in production. 
It is also possible, for the case of applica-
tions with elevated safety requirements, 
to construct a redundant system with two 
galvanically isolated signal paths and two 
ASICs. The sensor principle can also very 
advantageously be applied in a “cut-open” 
form as a travel sensor.

The principal benefits of this sensor, in ad-
dition to the very favorable production 
costs, are as follows:
 ▶ Contact-free and wear-and-tear resis-

tant measuring principle

 ▶ Complete temperature independence 

(up to 150 °C)

 ▶ High accuracy (up to approximately 
±0.09° for a measuring range of 360°)
 ▶ Flexibility (may be adapted to any angu-

lar range up to 360°)

 ▶ Possibility of a redundant design
 ▶ High EMC
 ▶ Use of standard materials exclusively, 
without the need for ferromagnetic 
 components

 ▶ Flat design

The sensor can therefore be used at very 
many points on the motor vehicle.

Magnetostatic sensors
Magnetostatic sensors measure a DC mag-
netic field. In contrast to the magnetically 
inductive (coil) sensors they are far more 
suitable for miniaturization and can be 
manufactured at reasonable cost using 
 microsystem technology. As DC magnetic 
fields can reach through housing walls of 
plastic, and also those of non-ferromag-
netic metals, with no problems, magneto-
static sensors have the advantage that the 
sensitive, generally fixed part, can be well 
encapsulated and protected against the ro-
tating part, generally a permanent magnet 
or soft-magnetic conductive element – and 
also against the environment. Above all, 
galvanomagnetic effects (Hall and Gauss-
ian effects) are used, as well as anisotropic 
magnetoresistive (AMR and GMR) effects.

Galvanomagnetic effect
The Hall effect is normally evaluated using 
thin semiconductor wafers. If a current-
carrying wafer of this type is exposed 
 perpendicularly to magnetic induction B, 
the charge carriers are deflected by the 
Lorentz force normal to the field and the

current I by angle w from their otherwise 
straight path (Fig. 11). This means that it is 
possible to pick-off a voltage UH transverse 
to the current direction between two op-
posing points on the edge of the wafer pro-
portional to the field B and to the current I 
(Hall effect).
(2) 
  
 
 
 

UH = RH ? I ? B/d
where RH = Hall coefficient, 
d = wafer thickness

At the same time, the series impedance of 
the wafer increases independently of the 
field direction following an approximately 
parabolic characteristic curve (Gaussian 
effect, magnetoresistor). 

The coefficient determinant for the mea-
surement sensitivity of the wafer RH is only 
comparatively small for silicon. As the 
 wafer thickness d can be made extremely 
thin, however, using diffusion techniques, 
the Hall voltage amounts to a technically 
usable magnitude. When silicon is used as 
the basic material, a signal-conditioning 
circuit can be integrated on the wafer. Sen-
sors using these principles are very cheap 
to produce. Silicon is by a long way not the 
best semiconductor material for Hall sen-
sors in respect of measurement sensitivity 
and temperature sensitivity. III-V semicon-
ductors such as gallium arsenide or indium 
antimonide possess better characteristics.

Hall switch
In the most simple case, the Hall voltage is 
applied to an electronic threshold circuit 
(Schmitt trigger) built into the sensor 
which then outputs a digital signal. If the 
magnetic induction B applied at the sensor 
is below a given minimum threshold level, 
the Schmitt trigger’s output value corre-
sponds to a logical “0” (release status);  
if it exceeds a given upper threshold the 
output value corresponds to a logical “1” 
 (operate status). Since this behavior is 
 guaranteed across the complete operating-
temperature range and for all sensors of a 
given type, the two threshold values are 
relatively far apart (approx. 50 mT). A con-

siderable induction jump DB is thus neces-
sary to operate the Hall switch.

Sensors manufactured in bipolar tech-
nology of this kind were used in Hall vane 
switches (Fig. 12), for example, as were fit-
ted in the housing for the camshaft-driven 
ignition distributor. This Hall vane switch 
contains the sensor and a permanent mag-
net and soft magnetic conductive ele-
ments. The magnetic circuit is U-shaped or 
forked in such a way that a trigger wheel 
vane in soft magnetic material can travel 
through the open end, alternately screen-
ing or exposing the magnet, thereby tog-
gling the Hall sensor between the operate 
and release states. 

A further application is the digital steer-
ing-angle sensor LWS3 (see “Hall angular-
position sensor up to 360°”).

Hall sensors of this type may be very 
cost-effective, but are really only good for 
a switch operation and are too imprecise 
for capturing analog values.

Hall sensors using the spinning-current 
principle
A disadvantage of a simple silicon Hall 
sensor is its simultaneous sensitivity to the 
unavoidable mechanical strain (piezoelec-
tric effect) resulting from the packaging, 
leading to unfavorable temperature sensi-
tivity of the offset. Applying the spinning 
current principle (Fig. 13), associated with 
a transition to CMOS technology, has over-
come this disadvantage. Although the 
piezoelectric effect still occurs here, it is 
compensated for by the signal being aver-
aged over time, as it occurs with a different 
sign in the case of very rapid electronically 
controlled interchange (rotation) of the 
electrodes. If it is wished to save the ex-
pense of the complex electronics for 
switching the electrodes, it is possible also 
to integrate several Hall sensors (two, four 
or eight) with correspondingly different 
alignment of the current paths in close 
proximity and to add their signals together 
in order to form an average. It is only in 
this way that the Hall ICs were also suit-
able for analog sensor applications.

These measures though did not result in a 
reduction of the considerable effects of 
temperature on the sensor’s measurement 
sensitivity. 

Such Hall ICs are suitable above all for 
the measurement of small travel distances, 
in which they register the fluctuating field 
strength of a permanent magnet as it ap-
proaches (e.g. the iBolt force sensor de-
tects the passenger’s weight to optimize 
the triggering of the airbag). Similarly 
good results could, in the past, only be 
achieved by using single Hall elements,  
e.g. in III-V compounds with a hybrid am-
plifier connected downstream (e.g. Hall 
 acceleration sensor).

Differential Hall sensors
The double Hall sensor (differential Hall 
sensor, Fig. 14) has two complete Hall sys-
tems mounted at a specified distance from 
each other on one chip. The associated 
electronics evaluate the difference be-
tween the two Hall voltages. The advan-
tage of such sensors lies in the fact that 
their output signal is for the most part 
 independent of the absolute value of the 
magnetic-field strength, and as differential 
sensors they only register the magnetic in-
duction’s change in space, in other words 
the field gradient (thus the common name 
of gradient sensor). 

Since the polarity of their output signal 
is independent of the air gap between ro-
tor and sensor, these sensors are mostly 
used for rotational-speed measurement.  
If a simple Hall sensor only is used to 
sense a gear wheel, this will not be able to 
distinguish whether the magnetic flux has 
modified as a result of the gear wheel turn-
ing further or by a change in distance (e.g. 
vibrations, mounting tolerances). Signifi-
cant scanning errors occur, as the signal 
must be passed to a threshold detector. 
The situation with differential sensors is 
fundamentally different. Here only the dif-
ference in the signals from two Hall sen-
sors located at a suitable distance from 
one another around the circumference is 
evaluated. If the signal difference is posi-
tive, for example, it is possible to freely 
vary the distance between the gear wheel 
and sensor; the difference will remain pos-
itive, even if the absolute value may be-
come smaller. The sign can only change  
if the rotor turns further. A threshold de-
tector connected afterwards thus has no 
problem in distinguishing between a 
change in distance and rotation.

Usually, in order to achieve as high an 
 output signal as possible, the distance be-
tween the two Hall sensors each located  
on the edge of the (elongated) chip is then 
selected to correspond to about half an 
 increment (half the rotor tooth interval).

The signal maximum is very wide and cov-
ers a broad range of variation of the incre-
ment spacing. More pronounced varia-
tions in the spacing necessitate a highly 
complex redesign of the sensor.

A gradient sensor must be precisely 
aligned to the rotor’s direction of rotation.

Hall angular-position sensors in the range 
up to approximately 180°
Using a rotatable magnetic ring (“movable 
magnet”), together with a number of fixed 
soft-magnetic conductive elements, a lin-
ear output signal can be generated for a 
larger angular range without conversion 
being necessary (Fig. 15). In this case, the 
bipolar field of the magnet ring is passed 
through a Hall sensor arranged between 
semicircular conductive elements. The ef-
fective magnetic flux through the Hall sen-
sor is dependent on the angle of rotation w. 
This principle is used on accelerator-

pedal sensors.

The Type ARS1 Hall angular-position 
 sensor with a measuring range of ap-
prox. 90° (Fig. 16) is derived from the basic 
“movable magnet” principle. The magnetic 
flux from a practically semicircular perma-
nent-magnet disk is returned to the mag-
nets through a pole shoe, two additional 
conductive elements each of which con-
tains a Hall sensor in its magnetic path, 
and the shaft which is also ferromagnetic. 
Depending upon the angular setting, the 
flux is led to a greater or lesser degree 
through the two conductive elements, in 
the magnetic path of which a Hall sensor  
is also situated. Using this principle, it is 
possible to achieve a practically linear 
characteristic in the measuring range.

The Type ARS2 is a simplified version 
which does without soft magnetic conduc-
tive elements (Fig. 17). In this version, the 
magnet moves around the Hall sensor in a 
circular arc. Only a relatively small section 
of the resulting sinusoidal characteristic 
curve features good linearity. If the Hall 

sensor is located slightly outside the cen-
ter of the circular arc, the characteristic 
curve increasingly deviates from the sinu-
soidal, It now features a short measuring 
range of just 90°, and a longer measuring 
range of a little over 180° with good linear-

ity. A great disadvantage though is the low 
level of shielding against external fields, as 
well as the remaining dependence on the 
geometric tolerances of the magnetic cir-
cuit, and the intensity fluctuations of the 
magnetic flux in the permanent magnet as 
a function of temperature and age.

Angular-position sensors in the range up to 
approximately 360°
Figure 18 shows an analog Hall angular-
position sensor with a measuring range  
of up to 360°. As shown, a permanent mag-
net rotates in front of two Hall sensors ar-
ranged at right angles to each other. The 
magnet should be adequate in size in order 
not to be too dependent on the tolerance 
of the magnet positioning. The two Hall 
sensors, fitted as closely together as possi-
ble, should here be positioned in the ho-
mogeneously directed portion of the per-
manent-magnet’s stray field, which also 
represents the angular location w of the 
permanent magnet. They are perpendicu-
lar to one another and parallel with the 
permanent magnet’s rotary axis. When the 
field-strength vector B rotates past the 
sensors, therefore, they register its x and 
y components:

(3) 
(4) 

UH1 = Ux = B?sinw
UH2 = Uy = B?cosw

The angle w can be calculated using the 
trigonometric relationship w = arctan (UH1/
UH2) in an associated commercially avail-
able evaluator chip, through which the 
sensor signal is generally digitized.

A Hall sensor arrangement of this nature 
can also, in principle, be integrated verti-
cally with VHD (Vertical Hall Devices) in 
the manner illustrated so that the plane of 
the sensor chip is arranged perpendicular 
to the axis of rotation and the sensor has 
an in-plane sensitivity, unlike a normal, 
planar Hall sensor (Fig. 19). Monolithic in-
tegration also guarantees the high level of 
precision as required for the 90° arrange-
ment and for the requisite compact form of

the two Hall systems. Sentron (Melexis), of 
Switzerland, is working on sensors of this 
type and will be launching them on the 
market in the near future.

Angular-position sensors of this type were 
considered for the implementation of 
starter motor-less instant start systems,  
for instance, where the absolute rotary 
 position of the camshaft over a 360° range 
must be measured.

There is, however, another trick which can 
be exploited to (additionally) give a nor-
mal, planar Hall sensor an in-plane sensi-
tivity. In the case of the method used by 
Melexis-Sentron (e.g. its 2SA-10 model) a 
total of four Hall sensors are mounted on 
the same chip in a tight circle offset at 90° 
to one another to measure the field com-
ponents Bx and By. To be accurate, in this 
case, each sensor consists of a Hall ele-
ment pair rotated at 90° for its part for the 
reasons described above. Once the chip 
has been manufactured, a circular disk  
of soft magnetic material approximately 
200 µm in diameter is fixed on its surface 
as shown in Figure 20 in such a way that 
the Hall sensors are located exactly be-
neath the edge of the disk.

Because of its high relative permeability, 
this disk acts as a flow concentrator (IMC, 
Integrated Magnetic Concentrator) and 
compels all field lines to pass into its sur-
face vertically. This compels the field lines 
running horizontally (in-plane) without 
the concentrator into a vertical direction 
(out-of-plane) at the position of the Hall 
sensors and thus they can modulate the 
Hall elements. As diagonally opposing 
elements each see fields in opposite direc-
tions, the difference between the two Hall 
voltages running in opposite directions is 
evaluated to capture a field component. At 
the same time, any vertical components Bz 
present have their effect eliminated. 

The additional evaluation of the summary 
signals of diagonally opposing elements 
can also be used to capture the vertical 
field component Bz; since these are not in 
the slightest influenced by the ferromag-
netic disk and the elements have also not 
lost their normal out-of-plane sensitivity

by it being fitted. In this way, an arrange-
ment of this type can be used to capture 
the induction vector B acting at the sensor 
location in all its three components. The 
electronic circuitry required to evaluate 
the signals including a µC-based digital 
signal processor (DSP) used to calculate 
the arctan function and the means re-
quired for an end-of-line calibration of  
the sensor (EEPROM) can cost-effectively 
also be integrated on the same chip as the 
sensor.

In order to measure angles up to 360°, it is 
sufficient to rotate a permanent magnet, 
preferably round in form, magnetized in 
parallel with the chip over the sensor chip 
with its integrated signal processing 
(Fig. 21). As the angle of rotation is formed 
using the arctan function from the ratio of 
the two sine wave and cosine wave sensor 
signals, the strength of the magnetic field, 
and thus also the aging of the magnets, its 
temperature sensitivity and its distance 
from the sensor surface are largely irrele-
vant. Only the rotary position of its magne-
tization is detected.

The maximum intrinsic deviation of the 
sensor is stated by the manufacturer as  
+ 2° for a measuring range of 360°. This 
can, however, be significantly improved 
by the user on calibration of the sensor. 
The accuracy of the digital output is then 
10 bits at a resolution of 12 bits. Because of 
the processing time required by the signal 
processor, the smallest sampling rate for 
a timing frequency of 20 MHz is 200 µs. 
A pulse width modulated signal output 
can be operated at a maximum of 1 kHz. 
The sensor needs 15 ms for initialization. 
A typical value for the measuring field 
strength is approximately 40 mT. The con-
centrator plate becomes saturated at flux 
densities in excess of 0.7 T. 

The sensor may also be programmed for 

any measurement range < 360° to good ef-
fect, with additional functional security 
being generated by out-of-range monitor-
ing (application as an angular-position 
sensor in the accelerator-pedal module 
FPM2.3, for instance).

Angles up to 360° may also be captured 
with the simplest Hall ICs (Hall switches), 
as are also used for the measurement of 
speeds of rotation, (application in LWS1 
type steering-angle sensors). Here, in or-
der to obtain an n-bit resolution, n Hall 
switches are arranged on a single track in 
a circle at equal distances from each other 
(Fig. 22). Depending upon its position, a 
rotatable soft-magnetic code disk blocks 
the magnetic field of the individual perma-
nent magnets located above each Hall 
switch, or opens it when it rotates further 
so that one after another the Hall switches 
generate n different code words (serial 
code). It is useful to apply the Gray code 
(cyclic binary code) to prevent errors in 
transitional states of the code disk. The 
Gray code is designed such that the code 
words for two adjacent positions – unlike 
the case with a natural binary code, for in-
stance – differ in only 1 bit, and so any in-
correct indication on the transition from 

Sensor measuring principles  |  Position sensors  |  247

one position to the next can never amount 
to more than one angular step.

For the practical implementation of a 
steering-wheel-angle sensor, the code disk 
is connected to the steering shaft for in-
stance, and the sensor’s non-moving parts 
to the vehicle body. One difficulty with this 
sensor is that the soft magnetic code disk 
must be mounted floating on the steering 
column for reasons associated with assem-
bly tolerances, which leads to a complex 
and space-hungry mounting there using a 
flexible plastic sleeve. Because of the air 
gap tolerance between the upper disk and 
the lower disk, the code disk is mounted  
in a wiping guide. A corresponding opto-
electronic solution using photoelectric 
light barriers is less satisfactory, as it is  
not possible to construct an adequate 
 encapsulation against the susceptibility  
of the sensor elements to dirt.

In order to measure a number of com-
plete rotations, an additional 3-bit configu-
ration can be used in which the code disk 
is rotated by a reduction gear. The resolu-
tion of such configurations is mostly no 
better than 2.5°.

Magnetoresistive sensors
In addition to the transversally directed 
Hall effect, there is also a longitudinal re-
sistance effect, also known as the Gaussian 
effect, that occurs on semiconductor wa-
fers. Elements that exploit this effect are 
known as magnetoresistors which are 
manufactured from a III-V-semiconductor 
(crystalline indium antimonide (InSb)).  
In contrast with the Hall sensors, the opti-
mum wafer shape for a magnetoresistor 
tends to be shorter and squatter, and rep-
resents a very low electrical resistance.  
In order to arrive at technically applicable 
values in the kV range, it is therefore nec-
essary to connect a large number of these 
wafers in series. This problem is solved 
 elegantly by adding microscopically fine, 
highly conductive nickel-antimonide nee-
dles to the semiconductor crystal. These 
are located transverse to the current direc-
tion. A further measure is to apply mean-
der techniques to the semiconductor resis-
tor (Figs. 23 and 24). 

The dependence of the resistance on the 
magnetic induction B follows a square-law 
function up to inductances of approx. 
0.3 T, and above this point it is increasingly 
linear. There is no upper limit to the con-
trol range, and dynamic response can be 
regarded as practically free from lag, as is 
the case for the Hall sensor.

Since their temperature sensitivity has a 
pronounced effect upon their resistance 
value (approximately 50 % reduction over 
100 K), they are usually supplied only in 
the dual-configuration form in voltage-di-
vider circuits (differential magnetoresis-
tors). For the particular application, each 
of the two resistor sections must then be 
magnetically triggered (as far as possible 
with opposite polarities). Notwithstanding 
the high temperature coefficients of the in-
dividual resistors, the voltage-divider cir-
cuit guarantees good stability of the work-
ing-point (that point at which both resistor 
sections have the same value).

In order to achieve good measurement 
sensitivity, it is best to operate the magne-
toresistors at a magnetic working point be-
tween 0.1 to 0.3 T. Generally, the required 
magnetic initial-tension is supplied by a 
small permanent magnet, the effects of 
which can be increased by using a small 
magnetic return plate. 

The magnetoresistor’s main advantage is 

its high signal level which is usually in the 
volts range. This means that amplification 
is unnecessary, as well as the local elec-
tronic circuitry and the associated protec-

tive measures which would otherwise be 
needed. Furthermore, in their role as pas-
sive, resistive components they are highly 
insensitive to electromagnetic interference 
and, as a result of their high bias voltage, 
practically immune against external mag-
netic fields.

Because of its pronounced temperature 
sensitivity, the magnetoresistor is used al-
most exclusively in incremental angular-
position and rev counters, or in binary 
limit-value sensors (with switching charac-
teristic).

Anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors 
(AMR)
Thin, only around 30 to 50 nm thick NiFe 
alloy coatings show an electromagnetically 
anisotropic behavior. That means that 
their electrical resistance changes under 
the influence of a magnetic field. Resis-
tance structures of this type are thus 
known as anisotropic magnetoresistive 
(abbreviated to AMR) elements or sensors. 
The metal alloy generally used is also 
known as permalloy.

Technology and designs
Even without an external control fields,  
a small spontaneous magnetization MS 
will arise in the longitudinal direction of  
a conductor track on a long slim resistor 
strip, as shown in Figure 25a, (shape an-
isotropy). In order to give this magnetiza-
tion a clearly defined direction – theoreti-
cally, it could be in the other direction – 
AMR sensors are often provided with weak 
bias magnets, as shown. In this state, the 
longitudinal resistance achieves its great-
est value Rll. If the magnetization vector is 
rotated under the effect of an additional 
external field Hy through angle q, the lon-
gitudinal resistance declines gradually un-
til it reaches its minimum value R  at q = 0. 
Here, the resistance depends only on the 
angle q which is enclosed by the resulting 
magnetization MS and the current I, and it 
has an approximately cosine wave pattern 
as a function of q:

R = R0?(1 + b?cos2 q) 
where Rll = R0?(1 + b) ; R  = R0

The coefficient b here identifies the maxi-
mum possible variation in resistance. It 
amounts to around 3 %. If the external 
field is much stronger than the spontane-
ous generated magnetization, and this is 
usually the case when permanent magnets 
are used, the effective angle q is almost 
completely a function of the direction of 
the external field. The field strength is now 
irrelevant, and in other words the sensor is 
now operating in a “saturated state”.
Highly-conductive short-circuiting 
strips (for instance of gold) on the AMR 
film force the current to flow at an angle of 
below 45° to the spontaneous magnetiza-
tion (longitudinal direction) without the 
application of an external field. As a result 
of this “trick”, the sensor curve shifts by 
45° compared to that of the simple resistor. 
This results in the so-called “Barber Pole” 
sensor. This means, therefore, that even 
with the external field strength Hy = 0, the 
curve is at the point of maximum measure-
ment sensitivity (reversal point). 

The striping of two resistors in opposite 
directions causes them to change their re-
sistances in opposite directions under the 
effects of the same field. In other words,

one of the resistances increases while the 
other drops. 

Being thin-film sensors, anisotropic 
magnetoresistive sensors also have the 
 advantage that they can be calibrated to  
a setpoint value (e.g. zero point) by laser 
trimming, for instance. In principle, the 
oxidized silicon wafers which serve as the 
substrate material can also incorporate the 
electronic circuitry for signal conditioning. 
At present, cost considerations dictate that 
sensor chips and electronic chips are for 
the most part manufactured separately, 
and then mounted and packaged in a com-
mon leadframe, for instance. The control-
ling magnetic field B is usually generated 
by magnets moving side-to-side or rotat-
ing over the sensor.

In addition to the simple, two-pole AMR 
elements, there are also pseudo Hall sen-
sors in practically square NiFe thin layer 
structures, that have four connections, just 
like normal Hall sensors. Two for the cur-
rent path and two transverse to this for 
pick-off a (pseudo) Hall voltage (Fig. 26). 
Unlike a normal Hall sensor, the pseudo 
Hall sensor, however, has its sensitivity to 
magnetic fields in the plane of the layer, 
and not perpendicular to it. In addition, it 
does not have a proportional characteris-
tic curve, but a sinusoidal one with very a

high match to a sinus wave, which does not 
depend in the least on the strength of the 
control field and the temperature. The out-
put voltage vanishes for a field parallel to 
the current path, to describe a sinus half-
period on rotation up to an angle w = 90°. 
The sinus voltage obtained in this way 
combined with the amplitude results in:
(6) 

 UH = uH?sin2w

If the external control field is rotated once 
through w = 360°, the output voltage follows 
two full sinus periods. The amplitude uH is, 
however, very dependent on the tempera-
ture and the air gap between the sensor 
and the control magnet; it declines with 
 increasing temperature and widening  
air gap.

The measurement sensitivity of the 
pseudo Hall element can be considerably 
increased (without excessively falsifying 
the sinusoidal shape) by “hollowing out” 
the element from the inside so that only 
the “frame” remains (Fig. 26b). This modi-
fication converts the pseudo Hall sensor to 
a full bridge consisting of four AMR resis-
tors from its geometrical form (Fig. 26c). 
Even when the bridge resistors are mean-
der-shaped, provided a given minimum 
conductor width is not fallen below, this 
still has negligible effect of the signal’s 
 sinusoidal shape.

Simple AMR angular-position sensor for  
ranges < 30°
Barber pole AMR angular-position sensors 
with limited precision and a restricted 
measuring range (max. ±15°) rely on the 
unbalance of a magnetoresistive voltage 
divider (differential sensor) comprising  
an elongated (possibly meander-shaped) 
permalloy resistor with highly conductive 
gold cross strips (Fig. 27). Although in  
the case of such sensors the zero point  
is largely independent of the distance be-
tween the magnet and the sensor, the gra-
dient of the characteristic curve, which for 
its part also depends on the temperature 
(TK around -3?10-3/K), on the other hand, 
is not. A sensor of this kind has already 
been considered as a cost-effective alter-
native for the measurement of pedal posi-
tions.

Simple AMR travel sensor for the mm range
Similarly, the simplest travel sensors may 
be built for a measuring range of typically 
just a few millimeters using individual 
 differential barber pole sensors (Fig. 28). 
However, to achieve good accuracy a con-
stant distance (air gap) is required be-
tween sensor and moving magnets, which 
embodies the position s to be measured. 
The temperature sensitivity of the charac-
teristic curve gradient can be very easily 
compensated for by means of an additional 
metallic thin-film sensor on the same car-
rier substrate, which will have around the 
same temperature coefficient, but with the 
inverse sign (e.g. Pt, Ti, Ni).

 

High-precision multisensor (POMUX) for 
travel ranges > 10 mm
There is an intelligent multisensor for po-
sition measurement built up with simple 
barber poles also known under the com-
mercial name of POMUX (position multi-
plexer). It exploits the fact that the symme-
try point or zero point of the characteristic 
curve is absolutely independent of the air 
gap and the temperature. Its use in a motor 
vehicle has often been considered (e.g. 
shock absorber stroke measurement), as it 
has excellent characteristics, in particular, 
extreme accuracy. It has also already been 
illustrated in a circular form as an angular-

position sensor for scanning a gravity pen-
dulum tuned to a low frequency, which 
may be used to determine the orientation 
of the vehicle (tilt sensor).

Angular-position sensor for 180° 
Pseudo Hall type magnetoresistive angu-
lar-position sensors utilize the practically 
100 % sinusoidal signal that is picked off 
from the output terminals of the four-pole, 
sensor structure, whereby two complete 
periods of the electrical output signal cor-
respond to a mechanical rotation of the 
magnets through 360°. Using a second ele-
ment, which has been turned through 45°, 
a  cosine signal is also generated (Fig. 30).  
By applying the arc-tangent function for 
instance, the relationship between the  
two signal voltages can be applied to 
 determine the measured angle using a 
 microcontroller or an ASIC. This applies 
throughout a range of 180°, and is for the 
most part independent of temperature 
changes and magnetic-field fluctuations 
(distance, aging).

A further prerequisite for the high accu-

racy of this sensor principle is that the 
field at both bridges is at least in the same 
direction (above a given magnitude, field 
strength is irrelevant). This can only be 
guaranteed when both bridges are directly 
above one another. A design was drawn up

Angular-position sensor for 360°
One serious drawback with AMR angular-
position sensors is their natural limitation 
to an unambiguously detectable angular 
range of 0° to 180°. This restriction may, 
however, be overcome by modulation of 
the direction of the magnetic flux by 
means of an alternating auxiliary magnetic 
field (Fig. 31). By contrast with the COS 
and SIN sensor signals which have a 180° 
periodicity, these modulation signals have 
a 360° periodicity. In this way it is possible, 
simply by evaluating the sign of the modu-
lation signals, to distinguish between

ranges and thus to double the unambigu-
ous range to 0° to 360°. Because the auxil-
iary field for the two sensor bridges points 
in different directions, the two modulation 
signals are phase-shifted. It is sufficient,  
to distinguish ranges, merely to determine 
the sign of the largest modulation signal in 
respect of absolute value. This means that 
distinguishing the ranges is not critical and 
is still easily possible, even in the case of 
modulation signals suffering heavy inter-
ference.

The magnetic auxiliary field is generated 
by a planar coil integrated into the AMR 
sensor chip (Fig. 32). The auxiliary field  
in the COS and SIN full bridge points in 
 directions 45° apart in accordance with  
the wiring arrangement.

The sensor can only be mounted on the 
end of a rotating shaft. Thus, for instance, 
it may be mounted on the end of the steer-
ing spindle for measuring the steering-
wheel angle in systems that do not require 
determination of multiple rotations of the 
steering spindle (e.g. steering-angle sensor 
LWS4).

Angular-position sensor in the range over 
360° (multiple revolutions)
A dual-configuration of pseudo-Hall angu-
lar-position sensors (180°) can be used to 
measure multiple rotations of a rotating 
component, a steering spindle, for in-
stance. The two associated permanent 
magnets are rotated via a step-up gear 
train (Fig. 33). As the two driving smaller 
gear wheels, which carry the control mag-
nets, differ by one tooth (number of teeth 
m and m+1), their mutual phase difference 
(difference of the angle of rotation: C - U) 
is an unambiguous measure of the abso-
lute angle position w of the steering spin-
dle. The system is designed such that this 
phase difference does not exceed 360° in  
a total of four revolutions of the steering 
spindle and so the unambiguity of the 
measurement is ensured. Each individual 
sensor also offers an indeterminate fine 
resolution of the angle of rotation. Using 
such a configuration, it is possible for in-
stance to determine the complete steering-
wheel range with a resolution of better 
than 1° (this principle is applied in the 
LWS3 steering-angle sensor).

Giant magnetoresistive sensors (GMR)
GMR sensor technology was developed a

applications in sensing angles and speeds

The essential advantages of GMR sensors 
over AMR sensors are the natural 360° 
range of unambiguity in angle sensing and 
the higher sensitivity to magnetic fields in 
speed of rotation sensing.

Unlike AMR sensors, GMR sensors con-
sist not of one magnetic function layer, but 
rather of a complex system of layers. A dis-
tinction is essentially made between two 
systems: on the one hand the GMR multi-
layers with typically some 20 sequences of 
alternating soft magnetic and nonmagnetic 
individual layers (Fig. 34a). On the other 
hand there are the GMR spin valves, com-
prising antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic 
and nonmagnetic functional layers. The in-
dividual layer thickness are in the 1 to 5 nm 
range in both systems, and so embrace just 
a few atomic layers.

The electrical resistance of a GMR layer 

stack depends on the angle between the 
magnetizations of adjacent ferromagnetic 
individual layers. It is at its maximum 
when they are aligned antiparallel and at 
their minimum when in parallel alignment 
(Fig. 34b).

GMR multilayers
The relative change in resistance (GMR ef-
fect) is 20 to 30 % in GMR multilayers and 
thus is ten times greater than the AMR ef-
fect. A hard magnetic layer, which will pro-
vide a suitable bias field, is added to the 
GMR multilayer stack to place the working 
point in a sensitive region of the character-
istic curve. The sensitivity of a sensor 
structure of this nature is about 0.8 %/mT 
which makes it greater than that of AMR 
barber pole structures.

GMR spin valves
Unlike the GMR multilayers, GMR spin 
valves (Fig. 35) are also suitable for angle 
sensing. In the latter, the reference magne-
tization necessary for angle sensing is gen-
erated, fixing (pinning) the direction of 
magnetization of one of the ferromagnetic 
layers (FM1) through interaction with an 
adjacent antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer. 
This is hence also known as the “pinned 
layer”. On the other hand, the magnetiza-
tion of the second ferromagnetic layer

Like an AMR angular-position sensor,  
a GMR angular-position sensor consists  
of two full bridges, of which one supplies  
a cosine-wave signal and the other a sine 
signal depending on the external field di-
rection (Fig. 37). The different magnetic 
reference directions MR required to 
achieve this are generated by local heating 
of the individual bridge resistors and cool-
ing in the presence of a magnetic field of 
suitable orientation. The field direction 
can be unambiguously determined over 
the full angular range from 0° to 360° by  
an arctan function.

37 GMR angular-position sensor with two full bridges

a

coupled by a nonmagnetic interlayer, is 
freely rotatable using the external mag-
netic field. This is accordingly known as 
the “free layer”. 

The resistance varies with a cosine-wave 

dependency on the angle w between the 
external field direction and the reference 
direction. The stability of the reference 
magnetization against the action of the ex-
ternal field is decisive for the accuracy of 
the angular measurement. This stability is 
significantly enhanced by the use of an ad-
ditional synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) 
(Fig. 36). This consists of two ferromag-
netic layers which are strongly antiferro-
magnetically coupled through a very thin 
nonmagnetic interlayer and, because of 
their vanishing magnetic net moment, no 
longer offer a face for the external field to 
attack. The magnetization of one of these 
two layers is pinned by the adjacent natu-
ral antiferromagnet (AFM). Both the inter-
action of the pinned layer (PL) with the 
natural antiferromagnet (AFM) and the 
mutual interaction of the ferromagnetic 
layers (PL, RL, FL) are determinant for the 
magnetic behavior of the layer system. 
Furthermore, the behavior is also formed 
by the shape and crystal anisotropy of the 
individual magnetic layers, as is the case 
with the AMR sensor structures.

Wave-propagation sensors
In recent years, the development of sen-
sors has concentrated increasingly on sen-
sors that acquire information from the im-
mediate and more distant surroundings of 
the vehicle. This refers to the distance to 
other vehicles or traffic and to obstacles 
(all-round view from the vehicle, Fig. 38), 
either for safety reasons or to support ve-
hicle handling.

Ultrasound propagation time methods 
are suitable for vehicle-to-vehicle distance 
monitoring in the near range (0.5 to 5 m), 
with optical propagation time or triangula-
tion methods using short-wave infrared 
light (lidar) for the medium range up to  
50 m, and electro magnetic radar for the 
long range (up to 150 m).

Ultrasound sensors
According to the echo-sounding process 
(Fig. 39), the sensors transmit ultrasound 
pulses with a frequency of around 40 kHz, 
and record the time taken for the echo 
pulses to arrive having been reflected back 
from an obstacle. The distance l from the 
send/receive head to the closest obstacle  
is determined from the propagation time t 
of the first echo pulse to arrive and the 
 velocity of sound c thus:
(8) 

l = 0.5?t?c

In practice, the geometrical distance a be-
tween an obstacle and the front of the ve-
hicle is determined using the triangulation 
method from the results measured (dis-
tance b and c) from two ultrasound heads, 
mounted at a distance d from one another 
(Fig. 40): 

Long-range radar sensors (76 GHz)
The vehicle-speed controller fitted is 
equipped with a long-range radar sensor 
(adaptive cruise control, ACC) for the auto-
matic detection of vehicles preceding in 
the same lane or even of obstacles in the 
path of the vehicle which could eventually 
necessitate application of the brakes. The 
working frequency is 76 GHz (wavelength 
l ≈ 3.8 mm) permits the relatively compact 
construction as needed for automotive ap-
plications. A Gunn oscillator (Gunn diode 
in the cavity resonator) feeds in parallel 
four adjacently arranged patch antennas, 
for example, which also serve to receive 
the reflected signals. Referred to the vehi-
cle axis, a plastic Fresnel lens in front con-
centrates the transmit and receive beam 
horizontally and vertically. 

The signal reflected on the vehicle in 
front is delayed in accordance with the 
propagation time. The distance a to the 
 vehicle in front and its relative speed Dv

GPS position and distance traveled 
measurement
GPS is the global positioning system using 
satellites, originally created by the USA for 
military purposes, but later increasingly re-
leased for civil uses. The system was com-
pleted in 1993 with a total of 24 satellites 
(21 operating, three in reserve) orbiting at 
an altitude of 20,183 km. More than 24 sat-
ellites have since become available. They 
are distributed over six circular orbital 
planes taking 12 hours to complete an orbit 
and so at least four (but generally up to 
eight) satellites are always visible above the 
horizon from any point on the earth’s sur-
face. They transmit continuous (digital) sig-
nals on a carrier frequency of 1.57542 GHz. 
The signals contain the following message, 
in simple terms: 
 ▶ Satellite identification code
 ▶ Satellite position
 ▶ Message transmit time (including date)

The satellites each have two cesium and 
two rubidium clocks which vary by less 
than 20 to 30 ns on board for the high-pre-

cision determination of the transmission 
time. The signal propagation times to be 
evaluated lie typically in the region of ap-
proximately 70 ms. The satellites identify 
themselves with a pseudo random code 
(PRN number), which is 1,023 bits long 
and is continuously repeated after every 
1 ms. It is imposed on the carrier as a 
phase modulation.

A user can take this information and de-

termine his own geographical position in 
three dimensions with a GPS receiver, con-
sisting of a GPS antenna, signal receiver, 
precision clock and microprocessor. Theo-
retically, the signals from three satellites 
are sufficient for this; since, however, the 
less complex clocks in mobile receivers 
(oscillating crystals) can differ from the 
satellite clocks somewhat, a fourth satellite 
must be used in order to eliminate the 
 errors generated by the receiver clock. 
The distance to the visible satellites is de-
rived from the signal propagation times 
measured. 

The position is determined – as shown  

in Figure 40 in only two dimensions of 
space – then using a trilateration method, 
according to which there is precisely one 
point in space which satisfies the three di-
mensional conditions. In addition, there is 
also the knowledge that the motor vehicle, 
unlike an airplane, must be located on the 
earth’s surface. Measurement is thus the 
more accurate the more satellites can be 
received and the better, i.e. the more uni-
formly the satellites are distributed across 

the sky. Since complete release for civil 
use (May 2000), the accuracies obtainable 
are about 3 to 5 m in a plane and around  
10 to 20 m in the determination of altitude. 
With the refinement of GPS to DGPS (Dif-
ferential GPS, mobile stations have contact 
with a fixed reference station via long 
wave signals) this variance can be signifi-
cantly further reduced. This makes resolu-
tions down to less than 1 m possible today. 

These accuracies are the more astonishing 
when the manifold sources of error in this 
very complex measurement is taken into 
consideration. For example, simply the 
fact that at the very high velocity of ap-
proximately 12,000 km/h at which the 
 satellites move, relativistic effects already 
play a not insignificant role. Time passes 
more slowly at high velocities than it does 
on earth. Time passes more quickly in 
weaker gravitational fields as are found in 
the orbital planes. The high velocity causes 
a dilation of time of 7.2 µs per day, the 
lower gravitation even has an effect that  
is around six times greater, although 
 opposing.

If the position data determined in a 
close sequence is stored in a mobile GPS 
receiver, such as in a motor vehicle, it is 
easy to derive the orbit and the speed of 
the vehicle. If the data is sent via a radio 
module to a fixed central location, the lo-
cation of the vehicle at any time will then 
be known.

Relative rpm and speed measurement
Examples of relative rotational speed are 
as follows: 
 ▶ Crankshaft and camshaft rotational speed
 ▶ Wheel speeds (for ABS/TCS/ESP)  
 ▶ Rotational speed of the diesel fuel-injec-

tion pump 

Here, measurement usually makes use of 
an incremental pick-up system comprised 
of a gear wheel and a speed sensor.

In the detection of relative yaw rate, de-
pending upon the number and size of the 
scanned rotational rotor markings, a dis-
tinction is made between the following 
types of sensor (Fig. 1):
 ▶ Increment sensor with closely spaced 
rotational markings. Up to a certain 
point, this form of sensor permits in-
stantaneous speed to be measured at 
points on the circumference, or the reg-
istration of very fine angular divisions.
 ▶ Segment sensor, with only a small num-
ber of scanned rotational segments  
(for instance, equivalent to the number 
of engine cylinders).

 ▶ Simple speed sensor, with only a single 

scanned marking per revolution, so that 
only the average rotational speed can be 
registered.

Measured variables
Speed and rpm sensors measure the num-
ber of revolutions or the distance traveled 
per unit of time. When automotive applica-
tions are concerned, these are in both 
cases measured variables which occur 
 between two components or with respect 
to the road surface or another vehicle. 
However, it is also necessary to measure 
the absolute rotational speed in space or 
about the vehicle axes (yaw rate). For in-
stance, for the electronic stability program, 
the yaw rate about the vehicle’s vertical (or 
yaw) axis must be determined by sensing.

Measuring principles
Conventional sensors used for rotational-
speed measurement are based on pro-
nounced measuring effects (e.g. inductive). 
They are therefore for the most part elec-
trically passive. That is, they are usually 
not provided with any form of local/on-site 
electronics. With the newer sensors, how-
ever, measurement is based on less-pro-
nounced measuring effects (for instance, 
the Hall effect), and these sensors thus 
need local, integrated electronics for signal 
conditioning. They belong in the broadest 
sense to the category of “intelligent sen-
sors” (which are also often referred to as 
“active” sensors). 

In fact, the sensors used for measuring 

absolute rotating speed (yaw rate) need 
highly complex electronic circuitry di-
rectly at the sensor since the measuring 
 effects used here are not only particularly 
small, but also require complex signal con-
ditioning.

Incremental rotational-speed measure-
ment takes advantage of a wide variety of 
different physical effects (some of which 
can be applied in sensors at a very reason-
ably price). Optical and capacitive sensors, 
though, are highly unsuitable for the rough 
operating conditions encountered in the 
motor vehicle. Here, magnetic-effect sen-
sors are used almost exclusively.

Sensor shapes
The following shapes of sensor are presently 
in use (Fig. 2) for speed and rpm sensors:
 ▶ Rod sensor
 ▶ Fork-shaped sensor 
 ▶ (Internal and external) toroidal sensor 

The preferred form is the rod sensor, in 
which the rotor teeth approach the sensor 
and which is also the easiest to install. The 
fork-shaped sensor is permissible in some 
cases, and is also in service in the field. 
This sensor must be roughly aligned to  
the rotor when installed. The sensor type 
in which the sensor surrounds the rotor 
shaft in the form of a ring is practically no 
longer used. From time to time, an inner-
ring sensor is used which is introduced 
into the end of a hollow shaft featuring an 
incremental internal structure. 

Unfortunately, although it is the most 
widely used sensor type, the rod-shaped 
sensor features the lowest measurement 
sensitivity and is problematical when air 
gaps become excessive. The fork-shaped 
sensor on the other hand is practically im-
pervious to axial and radial play. Regard-
ing toroidal sensors, the most widely used 
form combines a large measurement signal 
with pronounced insensitivity to geometric 
tolerances.

In many respects, the traditional inductive-
type sensors are highly unsatisfactory. 
Their output signal features an rpm-depen-
dent amplitude, and for this reason they are 
unsuitable for measuring low rotational 
speeds. In addition, they only permit com-
paratively low-level air-gap tolerances and 
are usually unable to differentiate between 
air-gap fluctuations and genuine rotational-
speed pulses. And at least the sensor tip 
must resist high temperatures when in-
stalled near hot components (e.g. the 
brakes). These disadvantages are behind 
the additional features aimed at with new, 
innovative sensors:
 ▶ Static detection (that is, at zero speed,  
or at extremely low cranking or wheel 
speeds)

 ▶ Larger air gap (non-aligned mounting 

with air gaps > 0)

 ▶ Small size
 ▶ Independence from air-gap fluctuations
 ▶ Temperature stability (≤ 200 °C)
 ▶ Detection of the sense of direction 

 (optional for navigation) 

 ▶ Reference-mark identification (ignition)

Magnetostatic sensors (Hall, magnetore-
sistors, AMR) are highly suitable for com-
plying with the first two demands. And, as 
a rule, they also permit compliance with 
the second and third stipulations. 

Figure 3 shows three fundamentally suit-
able sensor shapes, which generally are in-
sensitive to air-gap fluctuations. Here, one 
must differentiate between sensors which 
sense radially and those which sense tan-
gentially. This means that independent of 
the air gap, magnetostatic sensors are always 
able to differentiate between the north and 
south poles of a magnetically active pole 
wheel or rotor ring. 

In the case of magnetically passive ro-
tors, the sign of the output signal is then 
no longer independent of the air gap when 
they register the tangential-field strength 
(here though, the fact that the air gap is

 often enlarged due to the sensor is a disad-
vantage). 

Radially measuring differential-field or 
gradient sensors are often used. These al-
ways register only the gradients of the ra-
dial-field components, the signs of which 
do not change with the air gap but only 
with the angle of rotation.

Rotors
The rotor is of decisive importance when 
measuring rotational speed. It is usually 
provided by the vehicle manufacturer, 
while the sensor itself comes from a com-
ponent supplier. Previously, magnetically 
passive rotors have been used almost ex-
clusively. These are made from magneti-
cally soft materials (usually iron), and are 
less expensive than magnetically hard ro-
tors (also known as pole wheels). Apart 
from that, since they are not magnetized 
they are easier to handle, and there is no 
danger of mutual demagnetization (for in-
stance during storage). Unfortunately, this 
form of rotor is the most difficult to scan, 
particularly in combination with rod sensors.

As a rule, presuming the same increment 
width and output signal, the pole wheel’s 
intrinsic magnetism (a pole wheel is de-
fined as a magnetically active rotor) per-
mits a considerably larger air gap. 

Normally, passive rotors are in the form of 
gear wheels. In many cases, these are al-
ready present on the engine (for instance 
the starter ring gear). Otherwise they must 
be installed in a specific position in order 
to generate the required signal (as needed 
for instance for ABS). In the latter case, 
both planar-toothed and axial-scan ver-
sions are in use. 

An easily identifiable reference mark is 
required for each revolution when pick-off 
the crankshaft speed or position (for in-
stance, at the starter ring gear). This refer-
ence mark must allow a fault-free and 
 optimum timing of ignition and injection. 
The reference mark can be in the form of  
a completely (or partially) removed tooth. 
Due to the fact that a tooth space “takes 
more time”, the reference mark is immedi-
ately identifiable, particularly since the 
engine speed can only vary gradually and 
never abruptly.

In addition to gear wheels, stamped per-

forated disks or wave-shaped metal rings 
have been introduced in the meantime as 
low-priced rotors (ABS). 

It was the integration of ABS sensors in the 
vehicle’s wheel bearing which led to the in-
troduction of pole wheels some of which 
also assume the role of a sealing ring (plas-
tic-bound magnetic powder). Small, for the 
most part encapsulated, tachometer sen-
sors connected through a short flexible 
shaft with one of the vehicle’s wheels, also 
use pole wheels (with only very few poles) 
for generating a speed signal. These are 
usually picked off by means of integrated  
Hall sensors.

Inductive-type sensors
Inductive-type sensors were available on 
the market as coil versions long before the 
first suitable microstructure sensor ver-
sions (e.g. using the Hall principle) became 
available. Such inductive-type sensors use 
Faraday’s law when measuring rotational 
speed. In other words, they generate a 
voltage UA at their two-pole output which 
is proportional to the change (referred to 
time) of a magnetic flux F (w = number of 
turns).

UA = Uind = w ? dF/dt

The magnetic flux F is also a function of 
the rotational position x and the air gap dL:

where 
F = F(x, dL) and dL = const
the following applies:
UA = Uind = w ? −F/−x ? dx/dt

where dx/dt represents the (rotational) 
speed to be measured.

The inductive-type sensors’ weak point is 
underlined though by the equation: if it is 
impossible to keep the air gap dL constant 
(due to flutter or other forms of mechani-
cal play), the air-gap fluctuations induce 
the same change of flux as does a fluctua-
tion of speed. This effect can cause the 

4 Inductive speed sensor

generation of voltage pulses which are 
 either impossible, or at least difficult, to 
separate from the genuine engine-speed 
signals. Since the flux varies exponentially 
along with the change in air gap, and the 
air-gap fluctuations are often of the high-
frequency type (e.g. brake flutter), these 
unwanted pulses can feature a high voltage 
amplitude.

Inductive-type sensors are therefore 
always of the dynamic type, and being as 
their output signal tends to fall to zero in 
such cases, they are in principle also un-
suitable for the detection of extremely low 
speeds (quasi-static or static). The only ex-
ception here are the coil sensors which are 
powered by a carrier frequency and which 
are based on the eddy-current or damping 
principle. These though are hardly ever 
used in automotive applications.

Basically, inductive speed sensors are 
comprised of three important magnetic 
component parts (Fig. 4): 
 ▶ Fixed coil
 ▶ Soft-iron component 
 ▶ Permanent-magnet component 

The change in flux needed for the genera-
tion of the output voltage results from the 
motion or rotation of the hard or soft-iron 
magnetic component. The inductive-type 
sensors are preferably composed of a  
rod magnet (1) with a soft-magnetic pole 
pin (2) carrying the 2-connection induc-
tion coil (3). When a ferromagnetic gear 
wheel (5), or some form of similar rotor, 
rotates in front of this sensor (pick-up) the 
changing magnetic flux (which varies as a 
function of time) induces a practically si-
nusoidal voltage. 

For scanning very fine tooth structures, 
the end of the pole pin is sometimes pointed 
and acts as a flux-concentrating element. 
In other words it is shaped like a pole “blade” 
which usually projects through the metal 
or plastic housing and is adapted to the in-
crement structure regarding shape and di-
rection.

The rotor can be provided with one or 
more rotational markings (6). Figure 5 
shows the flux curve and the voltage in-
duced by a single rotational or reference 
mark (slot, cam, or pole pin).

Normally, the steep passage through 
zero which takes place at the mid-point of 
maximum flux is utilized for the electronic 

detection of such a rotational or reference 
mark. According to Faraday’s Law, in all 
phases the signal’s amplitude is propor-
tional to rotational speed. 

In order to ensure adequate, interfer-
ence-free evaluation in the control unit,

pulse (or of a periodic voltage pulse) USS

The reference point is detected when the 
distance between the passages through 
zero changes abruptly and causes a far 
higher signal voltage (corresponding to  
an apparently larger tooth) which has a 
negative effect upon the previous and 
upon the subsequent incremental voltage – 
this can under certain circumstances be 
undesirable.

Advantages
 ▶ Low manufacturing costs
 ▶ High immunity to interference: low 

static internal resistance (dynamically 
higher)

 ▶ No local electronics (electrically pas-

sive), that need to be protected
 ▶ No problems with DC voltage drift 
 (dynamic measuring principle)
 ▶ Broad temperature range (limited 

 primarily by the sealing compound 
characteristics)

Disadvantages
 ▶ Conventional coil technology imposes 

limits on size reduction

 unsuitable for quasi-static movements

 ▶ Sensitive to air-gap fluctuations

Examples of application 
 ▶ Inductive engine-speed sensor (crank-

shaft-speed sensor)

 ▶ Inductive wheel-speed sensor
 ▶ Inductive camshaft sensor (transistor-

ized ignition with induction-type pulse 
generator TZ-I)

 ▶ Needle-motion sensor (diesel-fuel 

 injection)

should be at least 30 mV. The major disad-
vantage of the inductive-type sensors is 
the fact that at high speeds/rotational 
speeds their output voltages can reach 
 levels far in excess of 100 V which are dif-
ficult to process electronically. 

If Zener diodes are used to clip the high 
voltage peaks, the resulting changes in the 
sensor’s load impedance lead to considerable 
phase-angle errors. With camshaft and 
crankshaft sensors this can have highly 
undesirable results with regard to the igni-
tion where the correctness of phase rela-
tionship must be better than approx. 0.2°.

Normally, the prepulse generated by the 
magnetic return field can be ignored at low 
speeds. With some magnetically passive or 
active rotational markings though, at high 
speeds the prepulse voltage can increase to 
such an extent that it exceeds the threshold 
value of the downstream threshold dis-
criminator and can cause an even greater 
error (Fig. 5a). For this reason, the thresh-
old values of the control unit input circuit 
are adapted dynamically to the speed in 
question.

row, a uniform tooth structure results in 
the practically sinusoidal voltage curve 
shown in Figure 5b. The speed is reflected 
in the periodic interval between the volt-
age’s zero transition points, while the am-
plitude is also proportional to the rotating 
speed. 

The signal amplitude is highly dependent 
(exponentially) upon air gap and tooth size. 
As is the case with all magnetic increment 
processes, up to air gaps of dL, teeth can be 
efficiently detected as from half or 1/3 of a 
tooth interval I.

dL ≤ l/(2…3)

The conventional ABS gear wheels and 
crankshaft applications cover air gaps of 
up to 0.8 and 1.5 mm respectively. The ref-
erence mark needed for the ignition and 
injection results from leaving out one or 
two teeth or by closing a tooth space.  

Provided that the air gap is not too nar-

 ▶ The output signal is rpm-dependent,

Magnetostatic sensors
Quasi-static speed measurement is best 
performed using magnetostatic sensors. 
Their output signal is independent of rota-
tional speed and depends solely on field 
strength, so that at high rotational speeds 
their low signal voltages are easier to han-
dle electronically. Furthermore, they not 
only have the advantage of imposing prac-
tically no limits with regard to miniaturiza-
tion, but also signal amplification and/or 
signal preprocessing can be integrated 
 locally. The fact that they are very small 
means that multiple systems such as dif-
ferential configurations, or arrangements 
with integrated recognition of direction, 
present no difficulties. 

On the other hand, such active sensors 

have a serious disadvantage, and that is 
the fact that their operating-temperature 
range is for the most part defined by the 
relevant Si (silicon) evaluation electronics 
which as a rule cannot withstand such high 
temperatures as the sensor element itself. 
For some time now, active sensors have 

been available with the option of a two-
pole current output, so that the two-core 
connection can no longer be regarded as  
a specific advantage of the inductive-type 
coil sensor.

Hall vane switches
If Hall Si sensors are to be used for incre-
mental rpm measurement, pronounced 
manufacturing scatter together with the 
effects of temperature mean that they must 
be provided with an adequate induction 
jump of typically 40 to 50 mT in order to 
ensure reliable high-speed switching. With 
conventional Hall sensors and acceptable 
air gaps, this was only possible with the 
sensor in the form of a “Hall vane switch” 
(for instance when used as ignition-trig-
gering sensors in the ignition distributor 
for earlier electronic ignition systems). 
The sensor and the electronic circuits  
for supply and signal evaluation are 
 integrated on the sensor chip.

This “Hall IC” (using bipolar technology, 
for sustained temperatures ≤ 150 °C, and 
for direct connection into the vehicle’s 
 onboard electrical supply), is located in  
a practically closed magnetic circuit com-
prising permanent magnet and pole pieces 
(Fig. 6). A soft-magnetic trigger wheel 
(driven, for instance, by the camshaft) 
 rotates through the remaining air gap. 
With a trigger-wheel vane in the air gap, 
the magnetic flux is short-circuited past 
the sensor element. On the other hand 
though, when a trigger-wheel opening 
passes through the air gap the flux is un-
hindered on its way to the sensor. This 
principle ensures that the sensor also per-
forms perfectly when the trigger-wheel 
varies in how far it penetrates into the air 
gap, or in case the air-gap shifts radially, 
that is vertically to the direction of rotation. 
Since Hall vane switches of this type fea-
ture limited rotational resolution they are 
mainly used as segment sensors. If the vane 
slot is too narrow, it is practically  impossible 
for the magnetic field to pass through, with 
the result that the required induction jump 
is not generated.

Simple Hall rod sensors
In contrast to the Hall vane switch, the 
working-point magnetization depends too 
much upon the width of the air gap, and 
the induction excursion is too small for 
 reliable switching with this configuration. 
Simple rod-shaped Hall sensors provided 
with a working-point magnet are therefore 
unsuitable for static or quasi-static scanning 
of a magnetically passive rotor (Fig. 7a, gear 
wheel). The switching point of a downstream 
threshold comparator (Schmitt trigger) 
would have to be continually adapted to 
the varying working point. Such applica-
tions are only feasible when DC coupling is 
dispensed with and therefore also static 
signal evaluation. The coupling capacitors 
required for such configurations (also 
known as DF sensors) involve high costs 
though and lead to reduced operational 
reliability.

However, simple Hall sensors are highly 
suitable for scanning a magnetically active 
rotor (Fig. 7b, pole wheel). The sensor is 
triggered by the pole wheel with varying 
polarity only in the vicinity of the magnetic 
zero point. Although the magnetic control 
excursion reduces along with increasing 
air gap, the position of the working point 

(B = 0) remains unchanged. Considering 
that the working point on new types of 
Hall sensors is to a great extent thermally 
stable, the switching points of the down-
stream threshold comparator can be set 
relatively close together. This means that 
relatively wide air gaps become possible. 
Air-gap fluctuations in this configuration 
cannot cause missing pulses as they do not 
lead to pole change. The pole change only 
characterizes the continuing measurement 
motion (rotation).

Gradient sensors
When it comes to scanning passive rotors, 
gradient sensors (Fig. 8) designed on the 
basis of differential Hall sensors or differ-
ential magnetoresistive sensors, are far 
better than simple Hall sensors. They are 
provided with a permanent magnet. This 
pole face of this magnet facing the gear 
wheel is homogenized by a thin ferromag-
netic wafer (2). Two galvanomagnetic ele-
ments (generic term for Hall sensors and 
magnetoresistors) are located on each ele-
ment’s sensor tip, at a distance of roughly 
one half a tooth. Thus, one of the elements 
is always opposite a tooth space when the 
other is opposite a tooth. The sensor mea-

sures the difference in field strength be-
tween two neighboring points on the cir-
cumference of the rotor. The output signal 
corresponds roughly to the field strength 
derived as a function of the angle at the 
circumference, and its sign is therefore in-
dependent of the air gap. Being as they do 
not alter the gradient signal’s sign, air-gap 
fluctuations does not cause missing pulses.
For signal evaluation, it is a simple mat-

ter to connect the two magnetoresistors  
as a voltage divider which is supplied by  
a constant voltage and whose (usually un-
loaded) output signal is registered by the 
control unit. At room temperatures and 
with the customary air gap, this signal is in 
the volts range, and even at high tempera-
tures it is suitable for transmission to the 
control unit without any form of preampli-
fication.

Provided appropriate circuitry is used, 

measuring the loaded output current of 
the magnetoresister divider instead of its 
open-circuit voltage permits the sensor’s 
pronounced temperature measurement 
sensitivity to be compensated for to a great 
extent. 

In the case of a gradient sensor based on 

the Hall effect, the current paths of both 
Hall elements can be connected in parallel, 
and their opposite-polarity output voltages 
in series, so that their differential voltage 
can be picked off directly and inputted to 
the downstream amplification and evalua-
tion stages.

Tangential sensors
Tangential sensors differ from gradient 
sensors by their reaction to variations in 
polarity and intensity in the components 
of a magnetic field located tangentially to 
the periphery of the rotor. Using AMR 
thin-film techniques, tangential sensors 
are available as barber-pole or permalloy 
resistor types in full-bridge or half-bridge 
circuits (Fig. 9). In contrast to gradient 
sensors, they need not be matched to the 
particular tooth pitch of the rotor and can 
in fact be designed to sense practically at a 

given point. Local amplification is neces-
sary, even though their measuring effect is 
approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude 
larger than that of the silicon Hall sensors.
In the case of the crankshaft speed sen-

sor integrated in the bearing (composite 
seal with sensor), the AMR thin-film sen-
sor is mounted together with an evaluation 
IC on a common leadframe.

For the purposes of space saving and 
temperature protection, the evaluation IC 
is bent at an angle of 90° and also located 
further away from the sensor tip.

Giant magnetoresistive (GMR) elements
The giant magneto resistance effect (GMR 
effect) was first demonstrated on multilay-
ers consisting alternately of thin soft mag-
netic and nonmagnetic layers (thickness of 
a few nanometers). An antiparallel align-
ment of the magnetization of adjacent fer-
romagnetic layers leads to the maximum 
electrical resistance, while parallel align-
ment shows a significantly lower resistance. 
The relative change in resistance for appli-
cation-relevant layer structures thus var-
ies in the range 20 to 30 %. This represents 
an increase over the AMR effect by a factor 
of around 10.

A bridge circuit of four GMR resistance 
elements, designed as a gradiometer is 
suited for the determination of rotational 
speed (Fig. 12). The resistors are intercon-
nected here in such a way that only one 
magnetic field difference at the two bridge 
locations results in a signal. The effects 
of homogenous interference fields can be 
suppressed in this way. As the reference 
direction for all resistors is identical, local 
heating in the magnetic field, as is neces-
sary to write differing reference magne-
tization directions in an angular-position 
sensor, is not required.

11 Characteristic curve for a GMR spin valve

The simplest layer system that shows a 
GMR effect is a spin valve (see also “Posi-
tion sensors” section). It consists of two 
soft magnetic layers, separated by a non-
magnetic layer. While the magnetization  
of the one soft magnetic layer is fixed by  
an antiferromagnet, the magnetization of 
the second soft magnetic layer can ideally 
follow the external field without interfer-
ence (free layer). The resistance is then 
minimal if the magnetizations of the two 
layers are aligned in parallel and is in-
creased by approximately 5 % if the mag-
netizations are aligned antiparallel. The 
interaction of the reference magnetization 
with the external field may be minimized 
with the help of a synthetic antiferromag-
net (SAF), comprising two ferromagnetic 
layers, that are strongly antiferromag-
netically coupled by means of very thin 
nonmagnetic interlayer (Fig. 10). This sig-
nificantly increases the robustness against 
interference fields. 

Figure 11 shows a typical characteristic 
curve for a spin valve. The two charac-
teristic states for the two opposing direc-
tions of the external magnetic field can 
clearly be distinguished. The spin valve is 
sensitive to field strength changes in the 
transitional range between high and low 
resistance.

The maximum signal amplitude for a gradi-
ometer sensor then results when the direc-
tion of the field at the two bridge locations 
is precisely 180° phase-shifted. This is the 
case on a multipole wheel, for instance,  
if the distance between the resistance ele-
ments corresponds to the distance between 
poles in the multipole ring (Fig. 13).

Examples of application
 ▶ Hall sensor (transistorized ignition TZ-H)
 ▶ Hall phase sensor (camshaft)
 ▶ Transmission Hall sensor (RS50, RS51)
 ▶ Active Hall speed sensor
 ▶ Active AMR speed sensor
 ▶ Magnetoresistive sensor (for diesel

Absolute rotating-speed measurement
Measuring principle of the oscillation 
 gyroscope
Basic principles
Mechanical gyroscopes (gyros for short) 
utilize inertial forces in precisely measur-
ing angular movements in space indepen-
dent of the reference system. Notwith-
standing their pronounced measuring ef-
fect, rotating gyroscopes as well as optical 
sensors based on the interferometric 
 Sagnac effect (laser and fiber gyroscopes), 

are out of the question for automotive ap-
plications due to the high costs involved. 

On the other hand, the slightly less-severe 
requirements on precision for applications 
in the motor vehicle can be complied with 
by gyroscopes manufactured using fine-
mechanical and micromechanical pro-
cesses. Instead of a rotational movement, 
these units use an equivalent, elastic, os-
cillatory movement to generate the mea-
suring effect. In principle, these sensors 
are similar to mechanical gyroscopes. 
They exploit the Coriolis accelerations 
which are generated when rotary motions 
are coupled with an oscillatory component 
(velocity v) (Fig. 14). These sensors are 
known as oscillation gyroscopes and are 
used in the electronic stability program 
(ESP) for the detection of the vehicle 
breaking away, in navigation systems for 
the detection of the direction of travel and 
in cameras to stabilize the image against 
wobbling. They also comply adequately with 
all automotive stipulations such as freedom 
from maintenance, long service life, switch-
on time constant etc., not to forget the ques-
tion of costs.

Oscillation gyroscopes measure the  
yaw rate around their “sensitive” axis.  
The yaw rate Vz around the vehicle’s 
 vertical axis (yaw axis) is measured in

the electronic stability program (ESP) and 
in the navigation system. Systems for trig-
gering rollover protection systems need 
data on the yaw rates Vx and Vy around the 
vehicle’s pitch and roll axes. 

Measurement of the Coriolis acceleration
Oscillation gyroscopes measure the 
 Coriolis acceleration in the following 
way: as the distance between a mass and 
the axis of rotation increases, the mass 
must cover a greater distance in the time 
of one revolution because of the greater 
radius. Circumference increases with the 
radius. The mass must, therefore, acquire 
a higher tangential speed and must be 
accelerated to achieve this. This acceler-
ation (Coriolis acceleration) is measured 
by suspending the mass on springs and 
measuring the bend in the suspension.  
If the distance of the mass, now rotating 
at a higher tangential speed, from the 
axis of rotation is now reduced, the mass 
must now become slower, as it needs 
only cover a shorter distance for each 
revolution. The braking deceleration re-
quired is also measured via the bend of 
the suspension. 

In the oscillation gyroscopes, the dis-
tance of one (or more) masses from the 
axis of rotation is periodically increased 
and then reduced again by an oscillation 
excitation (Fig. 14, movement in the y di-
rection). This means that the mass must be 
accelerated and then braked again in the 
same cycle (movement in the x direction). 
The forces necessary for this depend on 
the amplitude of the exciting oscillation 
and the current yaw rate. If the exciting 
 oscillation is kept constant, the yaw rate V 
can be determined from the acceleration 
forces. 

The Coriolis force acts in accordance with 
a known vector law perpendicular to the 
rotary motion and speed of the mass in 
motion (Fig. 14). This gives the Coriolis 
 acceleration as:
(1)  

aCoriolis = ax = 2?vy?x?Vz

Whereby, the velocity vy changes sinusoi-
dally in accordance with the oscillatory 
movement: 
(2) 

vy = vy?sinvt

This means that, at a constant yaw rate Vz, 
a sinusoidal Coriolis acceleration aCoriolis of 
the same frequency is measured. The am-
plitude is then:
(3)  

aCoriolis = 2?vy?Vz

The acceleration ay which is also applied 
to the mass m in the oscillatory direction is 
usually several orders of magnitude higher 
than the useful Coriolis acceleration. 
(4) 

ay = dvy/dt  = v?vy?cosvt

As the Coriolis acceleration has the same 
frequency as the exciting function, the use-
ful signal (the yaw rate) can be obtained by 
multiplication of the exciting signal and 
the Coriolis signal with subsequent averag-
ing (phase-correct rectification). Interfer-
ence signals of other frequencies are fil-
tered out (principle of the lock-in ampli-
fier). Averaging (with a low-pass filter) 
frees the output signal from the excitation 
frequency. An output voltage is generated 
which is proportional to the yaw rate:
UA = const ?aCoriolis = const'?V

Measuring principles
Acceleration sensors measure the force F 
executed on an inert mass m by an acceler-
ation a:

(1)  

F = m?a

Here, just as in force measurement, sys-
tems are available to measure displace-
ment as well as mechanical strain.

Displacement or travel-measuring systems
In the case of travel-measuring systems 
(Fig. 1), a mass m – the seismic mass – is 
elastically attached to the body, the accel-
eration a of which it is intended to mea-
sure. 

Constant acceleration
In the event of a constant acceleration, the 
acceleration force is in equilibrium with 
the return force applied to the spring with 
spring constant c deflected by x:

(2) 

F = m?a = c?x

The system’s measurement sensitivity S is 
therefore:

S = x/a = m/c

This indicates that a large mass together 
with low spring stiffness result in high

Variable acceleration
In the dynamic case, a damping force and 
an inertia force are to be taken into consid-
eration in addition to the spring force. The 
essential damping force is proportional to 
.
the velocity x
damping coefficient p. The inertia force is 
..
proportional to the acceleration x
. The re-
sulting equation (4) describes a resonant 
system: 

 and is described using the 

(4)  

.
F = m?a = c?x + p?x

..
 + m?x

 

Assuming negligible damping (p ≈ 0), this 
system has a resonant frequency of:
____
v0 = √   c
  m

 
(5)  
 

 

This means that in accordance with equa-
tion (3), the measuring sensitivity S is di-
rectly linked to the resonant frequency  
v0 in the following manner:

(6)  

v0

2?S = 1

In other words, sensitivity can be expected 
to be reduced by factor 1/4 when the reso-
nant frequency is doubled. It is only 
clearly below their resonant frequency 
that such spring-mass systems display ad-
equate proportionality between measured 
variable and deflection.

2 Measuring principles

Electrical  

Principle

pick-off

The resulting excursion is converted into 
an electrical signal by a suitable measuring 
technique (cf. Table 2).

Position control
Travel measuring systems allow the appli-
cation of the compensation principle, in 
which the system deflection due to accel-
eration is controlled out by an equivalent 
return force (Fig. 1b). The sensor element 
is now a component part of a closed con-
trol loop. The return force or the variable 
generating it (e.g. current or voltage) acts 
as a measure of the acceleration. The sys-
tem operates through closed-loop control 
very close to the zero point of the excursion 
and achieves a high degree of linearity. 

Closed loop position control produces  
a greater measuring range, which is only 
limited by the return force and a higher 
cutoff frequency than similar, non-motion-
controlled systems (Fig. 1a).

Damping
To prevent an excessive resonance, which 
would cause interference, pure deflection 
systems demand defined damping that is 
independent of the temperature. If the 
damping coefficient p is related to the 
other parameters in equation (4), this 
 results in Lehr’s damping factor D:

This dimensionless variable permits a sim-
ple description and comparison of differ-
ing resonant systems. Natural vibration 
and increase in resonance sharpness are 
largely determined by this damping factor. 
Values of D = 0.5 to 0.7 are preferred in 
practice (Fig. 2).

In the case of position-controlled sys-

tems, damping is implemented and ad-
justed in the closed control loop.

chanics. Because of the capacitive evalua-
tion, the measurement signal is deter-
mined only by the geometry and stable 
material parameters and is barely influ-
enced by variables such as temperature. 
The very small measuring capacities of 
these sensors, however, requires that eval-
uation electronics are provided in the im-
mediate vicinity.

The advantage of surface micromechan-
ics is the opportunity it provides to control 
by position or to deflect the systems by ap-
plying electrostatic forces (to the measur-
ing electrodes or to an additionally fitted 
electrode set). The latter, being a genuine 
electro-mechanical self test, is an effective 
means of checking the entire signal path.

Applications
Piezoelectric sensors are only used in the 
motor vehicle in acceleration and yaw-rate 
sensors. 

Longitudinal effect principle of action
Under the action of a force F, piezoelectric 
materials generate a charge Q on their sur-
faces to which electrodes are attached 
(Fig. 3). This charge is proportional to the 
mechanical stress generated by the force F.

Materials for piezoelectric components 
can be broadly classified into monocrys-
tals, such as quartz, and ceramics.

Piezoelectrically active ceramics are pro-
duced by sintering finely ground ferroelec-
tric materials. These ceramics then consist 
of very many small crystals randomly ori-
ented in space. These are then polarized in 
production by the application of a high 
electric field strength. This largely aligns 
the randomly oriented polarizations of the 
microcrystals.

Depolarization, with the consequent loss 

of the piezoelectric properties, can be 
caused in piezoceramics by temperatures 
above the Curie temperature, by intensive 
mechanical stresses or by polarization with 
opposite field strengths. 

The charges generated are discharged 
through the external resistance of the mea-
suring circuit or through the piezo sensor’s 
internal resistance. Such sensors cannot 
measure statically, and are only used where 
dynamic measurement is needed. The typi-
cal limit frequencies of this high pass re-
sponse, however, lie above 1 Hz, depending 
on the application.

Transverse effect and shear effect
In addition to the longitudinal piezoelec-
tric effect (Fig. 3a), there are also trans-
verse and shear effects (Figs. 3b and 3c).  

In practice, these effects occur together. 
The relationship between the charge gen-
erated and the mechanical stress acting 
can thus be formulated as a tensor equation. 
The transverse effect is used for exam-
ple in a bimorph. These are composed of 
two oppositely polarized piezoceramics 
used for the measurement of bending 
stresses (Fig. 4). When the two-layer 
 ceramic composite bends, one half is 
stretched (« > 0) and the other compressed 
(« < 0). The opposed-polarity of the ce-
ramic plates means that the resulting part 
voltages U1 and U2 now add to form a total 
voltage U which can be picked off on the 
two outside metal layers. 

Electrical signal evaluation
Piezoelectric sensor elements may be 
modeled as a voltage supply with a capaci-
tive internal resistance. The internal resis-
tance is infinitely high for ideal elements. 
Signal processing must be rated with cor-
responding care. 

There are two options for matching the 

impedance to subsequent systems:
 ▶ Electrometer amplifier (Fig. 5a): in this 
case, the voltage applied across the 
 electrodes is detected and amplified  
by an amplifier with extremely high im-
pedance input. Parasitic capacitances

however contribute to the transmission 
function. 

 ▶ Charge amplifier (Fig. 5b): here the 

charge is stored on a second capacitor. 
Parasitic capacitances have no influence. 

In both cases, resistors parallel to the sen-
sor element must be taken into consider-
ation for the transfer function. 

Thermal acceleration sensors
Thermal acceleration sensors generate  
a “bubble of heated gas” over a heater 
 element. The tight heated gas space has  
a lighter density than the surrounding, 
cooler gas. In the event of a lateral acceler-
ation, the low density area of gas is dis-
placed within the surrounding, cooler gas. 
The ensuing asymmetry is detected by 
thermocouples or resistors as a bridge 
 circuit. The bridge voltage represents  
the acceleration signal.

6 Principle of thermal acceleration sensors

Packaging
A packaging which is tailor made to suit 
each individual application plays a deci-
sive role for the quality of the sensor. Ac-
celeration sensors detect the measured 
variable without a movable connection to 
the outside world, it is no problem to en-
capsulate them hermetically. A rigid me-
chanical coupling to the body to be mea-
sured must, however, be achieved, as addi-
tional elastic or loose elements could lead 
to falsification of the measurement. On the 
other hand, this fixed coupling must not 
lead to thermal expansion which may 
 occur at the structure being transferred  
to the sensor so that measurements are 
 falsified.

nal elements such as knock sensors)

Measuring principles
Pressure as a measured variable is a non-
directional force acting in all directions 
which occurs in gases and liquids. It is 
propagated in liquids, and also very well  
in gel-like substances and soft sealing 
compounds. There are static and dynamic 
measuring sensors for the measurement  
of these pressures. 

The dynamic pressure sensors include 
for instance all microphones which, since 
they are insensitive to static pressures, are 
used to measure pressure pulsations in 
gaseous and/or liquid media. Since up to 
now, practically only static pressure sen-
sors have been used in automotive engi-
neering, these will be dealt with in more 
detail here.

Direct pressure measurement
Given that all known resistors are more or 
less pressure-dependent (volumetric ef-
fect), when very high pressures (>104 bar) 
are to be measured it would suffice to sim-
ply subject an electrical resistor to the 
pressure medium (Fig. 1a). On the other 
hand, they are at the same time more or 
less temperature-dependent, a character-
istic which is usually very difficult to sup-
press. Furthermore, the sealed lead-out  
of their connections from the pressure 
 medium presents difficulties.

 exposed on one side to the pressure to be 
measured and which deflects to a greater or 
lesser degree as a function of the pressure. 
Within a very wide range, its diameter and 
thickness can be adapted to the particular 
pressure range. Low-pressure measuring 
ranges lead to relatively large diaphragms 
which can easily deform in the range 1 to  
0.1 mm. Higher pressures though demand 
thicker, small-diameter diaphragms which 
generally only deform by a few µm. 

In case (capacitive) pick-offs for spacing 

or distance measurements are also re-
quired, voltage-measuring methods domi-
nate in the medium-pressure to high-pres-
sure ranges. Here, practically only strain 
gage techniques are used.

Capacitive pick-off
In contrast to their application in inertia 
sensors (see acceleration/yaw-rate sen-
sors), capacitive pressure sensors are still 
only rarely encountered even though they 
could possibly provide similar advantages 
(particularly with respect to their accu-
racy). This is more than likely the result of 
one important difference compared to the 
other sensors referred to above: pressure 
sensors need a direct contact with the 
monitored medium. The dielectric charac-
teristics of which practically always affect 
the calibration of such capacitive pressure 
sensors. This means that the calibration 
would then not only be dependent upon 
the medium in question, but would also be 
impossible without it (that is, in the “dry” 
state). Clear separation of the sensor from 
the monitored medium has up to now only 
been achieved at the cost of considerable 
technical outlay.

Strain gage pick-off
The elongations of the diaphragm occur-
ring on the deflection of a diaphragm-type 
sensor are detected using strain-gage 
technology (strain-gage strips or strain-
gage resistors). Strain-gage resistors are 
affixed to the diaphragm (e.g. vapor-
 deposited). Their electrical resistance 

 varies under the influence of mechanical 
stresses. The resistors are connected 
 together to form a Wheatstone bridge. 
Its voltage is a measure for the pressure. 

Table 1 presents a systematic overview 
of the proven pressure-measurement tech-
niques which to a great extent have al-
ready been used in automotive applica-
tions. The list is arranged according to  
the type of diaphragm material and the 
 applied strain gage technology. The combi-
nations have been marked to indicate ei-
ther those which are already actually in 
production and which will be described as 
actual examples in the “sensor designs” 
chapter (x), or those which are already 
 being closely considered for production

With regard to the particular measuring 
 effect’s magnitude and type, the strain-gage 
techniques listed above have widely vary-
ing characteristics. The gage factor (K) de-
fines the magnitude of the measuring effect 
of strain-gage resistors. It gives the relative 
change in such a resistor’s resistance R re-
ferred to the relative change in its length l 
(equation 1):

n is the material’s Poisson ratio, r repre-
senting its electric conductivity. n charac-
terizes the reduction in cross-section of the 
material on elongation and, in the ideal-
ized case of a volume being kept constant, 
amounts to n = 0.5 (in reality n = 0.3 to 0.4).
Whereas the conductivity term in equa-

tion 1 is of hardly any importance in the 
case of metallic resistors, with regard to  
Si resistors it plays a dominant role. 

One refers to a longitudinal K factor when 
the resistor is expanded in the current di-
rection and to a transverse K factor when 
it is expanded transverse to the current di-
rection (Fig. 2). Table 2 provides an over-
view of typical values for the most impor-
tant gage factors. 

“Creep” (slight mechanical give under 
the effects of long-term unidirectional load-
ing) is a highly-feared phenomenon which, 
when it occurs at all, is only encountered on 
glued foil strain gage. The other strain gage 
techniques all apply non-glued techniques 
and are not affected by this phenomena.

This means that there are four different 
 basic types of pressure sensor (Table 3):
 ▶ Absolute pressure
 ▶ Reference pressure
 ▶ Barometric pressure and 
 ▶ Differential pressure

Transfer to a force sensor
Instead of directly using the force taken  
up by their diaphragm, a number of sen-
sors transfer it to a force sensor whose 
measurement range can remain constant 
due to the fact that the purely mechanical 
diaphragm has already performed the 
 adaptation to the pressure-measuring 
range. Perfect linkage from measuring 
 diaphragm to force sensor (for instance  
by a tappet) must be ensured though.

Force and torque sensors

Measured variables
The following list underlines the wide vari-
ety of applications for force and torque 
sensors in automotive engineering:
 ▶ In the commercial-vehicle sector, cou-
pling force between the tractor vehicle 
and its trailer or semitrailer for the 
closed-loop controlled application of  
the brakes, whereby neither push nor 
pull forces are active at the drawbar 
 ▶ Damping force for use in electronic 

chassis and suspension control

 ▶ Axle load for electronically controlled 
braking-force distribution on commer-
cial vehicles 

 ▶ Pedal force on electronically-controlled 

brake systems

 ▶ Braking force on electrically actuated, 

electronically-controlled brake systems 

 ▶ Drive and brake torque 
 ▶ Steering and steering servo torque 
 ▶ Finger protection on power windows 
and electrically operated sliding sun-
roofs 

 ▶ Wheel forces
 ▶ Weight of vehicle occupants (for occu-

pant-protection systems)

In many cases, initial developments failed 
to lead to the expected results since gener-
ally the costs involved in achieving the 
stipulated accuracy were excessive for  
the systems in which the sensors were to 
be installed. Contrary to expectations, it 
proved impossible to force down the costs 
for the production of good torque sensors 
below those for pressure and acceleration 
sensors. In fact the torque sensors cost 
more. Matters are aggravated, and this ap-
plies particularly to torque sensors, when 
the measured variable has to be trans-
ferred using non-contact methods from  
a rotating shaft (e.g. steering spindle or 
drive shaft) to a sensor mounted on the 
chassis. Collector rings are not acceptable 
for the motor vehicle.

Since any form of measurement of only 
part of the force or torque is very prob-
lematical and can easily lead to false re-
sults, force and torque sensors must be 
 directly connected into the power flux  
(in other words, the complete measured 
variable must pass through them). Sensors 
that measure force are extensive sensors, 
in other words, their size depends directly  
on the measuring range.

Although, in line with automotive-indus-
try demands, there are compact force and 
torque sensors on the market, these only 
measure accurately enough when the 
forces are introduced to the sensor in a 
precisely defined manner, a stipulation 
that normally can only be complied with 
under laboratory conditions. The toler-
ances and misalignment normally encoun-
tered in practice generally dictate the con-
nection of homogenization elements which 
in turn then lead to the sensors becoming 
too large.

If force and torque-transfer components 

must be cut in order for previously test-
able sensors to be fitted, this generally re-
sults in an interface problem. This can only 
be solved by close cooperation between 
the sensor supplier and the various suppli-
ers of the parts (or vehicle manufacturer) 
which must be cut in order to install the 
sensors. Up to now, this problem has not 
been encountered with other sensor types, 
at least not with this severity and with such 
wide-ranging implications.

Even if the force and torque-transfer 
components do not have to be cut, and me-
chanical elements are used as measuring 
springs which only need modifying for in-
stallation of the sensor elements, very pre-
cise alignment is still necessary.

Even though hardly any series produc-
tion force and travel sensors are currently 
available from Bosch for the motor vehicle, 
there follows a brief overview of the most 
important measuring principles and pro-
posed developments that have made it to 
the shortlist.

280  |  Sensor measuring principles  |  Force and torque sensors

Measuring principles
Basically speaking, when considering 
force and torque measurement, a differ-
ence must be made between static and dy-
namic measuring principles, and between 
measuring principles based on displace-
ment and mechanical strain. Past require-
ments were predominantly for static sen-
sors, and in the case of force sensors, 
 generally non-resilient strain-measuring 
principles were preferred. “Soft”, resilient 
sensor systems are only accepted for 
torque sensors, particularly in the current 
example of steering-wheel torque sensing, 
which can also be implemented using an-
gle-measurement pick-offs. This is possi-
ble, particularly because this characteris-
tic proved to be tolerable in earlier hy-
draulic systems which were not equipped 
with sensors. The use of magnetically ac-
tive coil systems previously dominated 
both sectors, force and torque sensing,  
in automotive and industrial uses.

More recently, however, displacement 

measuring magnetostatic sensors (Hall 
sensors) are being used here, too, to allow 
the application of micro-structured ele-
ments manufactured in series production 
(e.g. measurement of the passenger’s 
weight) and, despite the familiar problems 
with dirt and the complexity of their instal-
lation, optoelectronic pick-offs are also

 being considered (e.g. for electronic 
power- assisted steering systems), which 
simultaneously permit torque measure-
ment and high-resolution angle of rotation 
measurement.

Strain measuring force sensors
Magnetoelastic principle
Under the influence of a magnetic field, 
ferromagnetic materials change their 
length in the direction of the field (magne-
tostriction effect). The length can either 
 increase (positive magnetostriction) or re-
duce (negative magnetostriction) here de-
pending on the material, for the same field 
direction. The inversion of this effect, the 
change in the magnetic characteristics un-
der the effect of tensile and compressive 
stresses, or elongation and compression,  
is known as the magnetoelastic effect.  
This effect is expressed in an anisotropic 
(directional) behavior of relative magnetic 
permeability mr (relationship between 
magnetic induction B and magnetic field 
strength H). If this still has the same value 
in all directions (isotropic) in a force-free 
situation, it takes on a somewhat different 
value (mrl) in the direction of the force un-
der the influence of a force F introduced 
than that transverse to it (mrq) (Fig. 1). The 
effect is not only observed on crystalline 
or polycrystalline materials, but also in 
amorphous substances.

In fact, the permeability change in the 
direction of force is a true reflection of the 
sign of the force. Even though practically 
all ferromagnetic materials demonstrate 
this effect, it can be optimized by using a 
specific alloy composition. Unfortunately 
though, the materials which have good lin-
earity, low hysteresis, and low temperature 
sensitivity, are not identical with the ones 
which have a high measuring effect. 
Whereas the maximum measuring effects 
observed up to the present are about 30 % 
(referred to the fundamental isotropic val-
ues), and can be utilized without electron-
ics being necessary, the effect displayed by 
materials which have been optimized from

the point of view of measurement tech-
niques is only in an area of a few percent 
and needs electronic amplification.

The advantages of the magnetoelastic 
effect are to be found in its broad tempera-
ture range and the fact that technical ap-
plications are possible up to temperatures 
as high as approximately 300 °C. On the 
other hand, it represents a marked volume 
effect. This means that the coils used for 
detection not only register a local variation 
of permeability (as with a strain gage, for 
instance) caused by the application of force, 
but more or less the effects throughout  
the whole of the coil’s cross section. This 
makes the sensor somewhat less sensitive 
to the possibility of force being applied 
asymmetrically.

Since the changes in permeability as a 
function of applied force are practically 
 always registered with the help of alter-
nating fields, the penetration depth of 
these fields, which is highly frequency-
 dependent, must be observed: 

Only those mechanical forces can con-
tribute to the measuring effect which are 
present in the measuring field’s effective 
penetration depth. In order to be able to 
put the measuring effect to maximum use, 
the magnetically active air gap should be 

kept as small as possible. Often, this means 
that the magnetically active measuring cir-
cuit is closed with ferromagnetic material, 
even when this is not included in the 
power flux.

Figure 2 shows the two most important 

possibilities of evaluating the magneto-
elastic effect: If a coil is arranged on the 
measurement structure so that its direc-
tion of field coincides with the direction of 
applied force, the change in inductance L 
can be picked-off and applied directly. In-
dependent of the magnitude of the applied 
force, the excitation field strength H and 
the induction B always have the same di-
rection (Fig. 2a). 

If the field strength H of the supply coil 
is not axially parallel to the applied force, 
the effect of the latter not only changes the 
magnetic induction B, but also its direction 
(due to the anisotropy of the permeability, 
Fig. 2b). Assuming that with no force ap-
plied the directions of H and B are super-
posed one upon the other in the normal 
manner, these assume increasingly differ-
ent directions when force is applied and 
increased. This can be exploited particu-
larly advantageously in the variation of the 
magnetic coupling of two coils affixed at 
90° to one another (Kreuzduktor) (Fig. 3).

Strain gage principle (piezoresistive)
Strain-gage measuring resistors (strain-
gage strips) represent the most wide-
spread and probably the most reliable and 
precise method for measuring force and 
torque (Fig. 4). Their principle is based  
on the fact that in the zone of the elastic-
member material to which Hooke’s Law 
applies there is a proportional relationship 
between the mechanical strain s in the 
member, caused by the introduction of 
force, and the resulting elongation «. In 
this case, in accordance with Hooke’s law:

(1) 

« = Dl/l = s/E

whereby the proportionality constant E is 
the modulus of elasticity. Since it does not 
directly measure the strain resulting from 
the applied force, but rather the – locally – 
resulting elongation, the strain-gage 
method can be regarded as an indirect 
measuring method. For instance, if the 
modulus of elasticity decreases by 3 % 
above 100 K, a figure which is normal for 
metals, then the force indicated by the 
strain-gage method is 3 % too high. 

Strain-gage resistors in the form of film 
resistors – by contrast with cemented-on 
strain gages – are so closely bonded to the 

surface of the selected elastic member that 
they follow its surface elongation perfectly. 
The change in resistance resulting from 
the resistor’s elongation is defined by the 
particular gage factor K of the resistor in 
question (refer to “pressure sensors”):

(2) 

DR/R = K?«

The K factor generally does not exceed a 
value of 2 for metal-film resistors, but is 
generally somewhat below this in practice. 
Strain gages are designed such that they 
(in conjunction with a specific elongating 
material (substrate) and their thermal 
elongation) have no inherent temperature 
sensitivity where possible (TCR ≈ 0). Any 
residual temperature sensitivity is usually 
eliminated by depositing the resistors on 
the elastic member in the form of a half  
or full bridge. Since temperature effects 
result in same-direction changes on the 
strain gage this results in no output signal.
The auxiliary bridge resistors can be (but 
need not be) located within the elastic mem-
ber’s elongation zone. They can also be 
 fitted as purely compensation resistors 
(Fig. 4c). It must be noted that often the  
K factor itself also has a temperature coef-
ficient (TCK). Usually, this decreases along

with increasing temperature, which means 
that in favorable cases it can compensate 
for the signal increase caused by the mod-
ulus of elasticity. Apart from this, signal 
reductions caused by the K factor are usu-
ally compensated for by a bridge supply 
voltage U0 which increases accordingly.

In addition to the longitudinal K factor Kl 
 described above, there is also the transverse 
K factor Kt, which must then be applied if the 
direction of strain is transverse to the cur-
rent flow. It has an inverse sign (negative) 
and is no greater than 0.5 in value.

Disadvantages/limitations:
Notwithstanding their high levels of accu-
racy and reliability, since the elongations 
and therefore also the changes in resis-
tance (at least in the case of metal film re-
sistors) are only in the percentage range  
of the original state, the strain-gage sen-
sors only generate output signals in the 
mV range so that in general local amplifi-
cation is required. A further disadvantage 
of small strain-gage sensors is the fact  
that they measure precisely the strain

(and only this strain) at the point at which 
it is applied. This, of course, no longer 
holds true in cases in which the strain-
gage structure is distributed across the 
elastic member’s complete surface. This 
necessitates extremely precise and repro-
ducible application of the force to be mea-
sured if measuring errors due to uneven 
force introduction are to be avoided.

Application:
As a rule, in order to carry out force mea-
surements, very small strain-gage resistors 
must be attached to larger force-carrying 
parts or elastic members. The traditional 
method of applying the strain-gage resis-
tors to the elastic member by means of a 
foil backing (as applied in such devices as 
high-precision scales), is not inexpensive 
enough for large-batch “low-cost” produc-
tion. First attempts are therefore being 
made to apply low-cost, large batch film/
layer techniques by depositing the strain-
gage resistors on small metal wafers which 
are then pressed into, or welded onto the 
elastic element.

Orthogonally printed resistors
Practically all electrical film resistors 
change their resistance not only under the 
influence of laterally applied deformation 
strain but also when compression is ap-
plied vertical to the film plane (orthogo-
nal). Here, the so-called “conductive plas-
tic”, commonly used in potentiometers, 
features very high sensitivity. “Cermet” 
and “carbon layers” are also highly sensi-
tive (Fig. 5). Up to a certain limit, the resis-
tance of the above materials decreases 
along with increasing compression. The 
values that can be achieved without per-
manent resistance change are similar to 
those which apply for lateral elongation.  
In both cases, the limit is a function of 
 substrate strength and not of the resis-
tance material. Of course, sensors of this 
type are almost only suitable for loading 
by compression but not by lateral strain.

Travel measuring force sensors
The question of whether an integrated 
travel-measuring weight sensor still has a 
little additional elasticity or not is not im-
portant when it is built into seats for motor 
vehicle occupants, which are anyway sus-
pended.

This principle is used in the iBolt™ force 

sensor (see sensor types). Four of these 
sensors are built into the frame of the front 
passenger seat for measuring the weight  
of the passenger. This makes it possible  
to modify the triggering of the airbag.  

Examples of application for force sensors
 ▶ Magnetoelastic load measuring bolts 
(agricultural tractor with plow force 
control)

 ▶ iBolt™ force sensor for sensing passen-

ger weight 

Torque sensors
A fundamental distinction is made in 
torque measurement, too, between meth-
ods using angle or strain measurement.  
In contrast to strain-measurement meth-
ods (strain-gage resistors, magnetoelastic), 
angle-measurement methods (e.g. eddy 

6 Torque measurement: basic principle

current) require a certain length l of the 
torsion shaft via which the torsion angle 
(approximately 0.4 to 4°) can be picked-off. 
The mechanical stress s proportional to 
the torque is aligned at an angle of less 
than 45° to the shaft axis (Fig. 6).

The principles described below are all 
suited for the non-contacting (proximity) 
transfer of measured values, even from ro-
tating shafts. In the case of steering-torque 
measurement, it is also desirable for the 
employed measuring system to measure  
the steering angle very accurately (through 
a full rotation of 360°). This is in the sense 
of modular integration and is to be imple-
mented with only slight modification.

Strain-measuring sensors
Even though magnetoelastic sensors which 
enclose the shaft are available on the mar-
ket, these involve very high costs. Since it 
is often impossible to optimize the shaft 
material with regard to its magnetoelastic 
properties, a search is being made for 
methods to coat the measuring shaft with  
a magnetoelastic layer. Such a coating, 
which has to exhibit good measuring quali-
ties, has still not been found.

This is why the strain gage principle has 
become predominant (Fig. 7): a strain-gage 
bridge measures the mechanical stress. 
The bridge is powered using transformer 
principles (by a rectifier and control-elec-
tronics circuitry on the shaft, independent 
of the air gap). Further local electronic 
components on the shaft permit the mea-
surement signal to be amplified and con-
verted to an AC form which is independent 
of the air gap (for instance, frequency-ana-
log) which can then also be outputted us-
ing transformer principles. 

When large-batch quantities are in-

volved, the electronic circuitry on the shaft 
can be integrated in a single chip without 
problems. The strain-gage resistor can be 
inexpensively formed on a prefabricated 
round steel plate (for instance, using thin-
film techniques) which is then welded to 
the shaft. The two ring transformers re-

quired for power and signal transmission 
can be manufactured at an extremely  
low cost from a soft-magnetic molding 
compound. High precision levels can be 
achieved with such a configuration in  
spite of reasonable manufacturing costs.

Angle-measuring (torsion-measuring) sensors
Sensors for measuring angular difference
It is a relatively easy matter to determine 
the torsion angle when two mutually-inde-
pendent incremental speed sensors, or an 
absolute-measuring (analog or digital) 
non-contacting angular-movement pick-
off, are provided at each end of the 
section of the shaft subject to torsion  
(L ≈ 5 to 10 cm) (Fig. 8). The difference 
in their outputs w2 - w1 is a measure for 
the torsion angle:

(3) 
 
 

M = const?L?(w2 - w1)
where L =  length of the 

section subject  
to torsion

Up to now, since adequate accuracy de-
mands extremely precise bearings, to-
gether with the necessity to provide corre-
spondingly accurate angular or incremental 
subdivision around the complete periph-
ery, this method has been regarded as too 
complicated. Nevertheless work is forcing 
ahead with solving this problem (magneti-
cally or optically), because such a system 
would incorporate two distinct advantages:
 ▶ Possibility of simultaneous measure-
ment of the angle of rotation with the 
same system

 ▶ Possibility of measurement without far-
reaching modifications to the torsion 
shaft being necessary, so that essentially 
the sensor could be in the form of a 
plug-in sensor providing an efficient 
 interface for a supplier component

The angle may be measured with high 
 precision using the vernier principle, for 
example: this is done by marking the cir-
cumference of the shaft with a sinusoidal 
track, of which an integer number of  
N  cycles fits in one circumference.

By contrast with a pure incremental track, 
which would permit only a resolution of an 
N-th of the circumference, this sinusoidal 
signal structure, however, theoretically 
permits as fine a resolution per circumfer-
ence as is required by the application of 
the arcsin function within a single sine 
 cycle. This fine resolution is, however,  
only useful if it is always known in which 
of the N similar cycles one is located.

The unambiguity can easily be created  

if a second track with a little less spatial 
frequency in which only N-1 sine cycles  
fit on the circumference is applied around 
the circumference. Although the two sig-
nals do not supply an unambiguous signal 
for an angle-of-rotation measurement,  
it is, however, possible to draw firm con-
clusions from the phase difference Dw be-
tween the two signals, in which sine cycle 
one is currently located. The pitch differ-
ence between the two signals varies over 
the entire circumference by precisely 360°. 
Figure 10 shows an example with N = 10.  
If the phase difference between the two 
signals is, for instance, in the range be-
tween 36° and 72°, then one is clearly lo-

cated in the second sine cycle. If the value 
is between 216° and 252°, one is located  
in the 6th cycle. The precise measuring 
 angle w is then formed by adding another 
angle, in the first case of 360° and in the 
second case of 216° to the measured, but 
not unambiguous fine signal w.
In practice however, the arcsin function 
is not used to resolve the individual sine 
cycles finely, as it would be necessary to 
guarantee a constant and normalized sig-
nal amplitude for this. It is rather the case 
that a second, cosine-wave track, phase-
shifted against the first by precisely 90°, 
is applied next to the sine-wave marking. 
Because of the spatial vicinity, it may be 
assumed that both tracks are sensed with 
the same amplitude u, so that the angle w 
within the sine cycle can be determined by 
the arctan function from the two individual 
signals u1 and u2 independently of u:

(4) 

 

 

w =  arctan (u1/u2)

where u1 = u?sin w  and

must be precisely manufactured and as-
sembled in order to achieve the stipulated 
accuracy. The associated electronics are 
appropriately accommodated very near  
to the coils.

Although this sensor principle was de-
veloped at Bosch for motor vehicle appli-
cations, it was only used in electric power 
tools (torque sensing in industrial power 
screwdrivers). A license-holder in Japan 
has further developed this, very cost-ef-
fective, sensor principle for motor vehicle 
applications to product maturity. 

Examples of application for torque sensors 
 ▶ Strain gage steering torque sensor (de-

veloped up to A prototype for electrical 
power-assisted steering)

 ▶ Angle-measuring eddy-current torque 
sensors (electric power tools, third-
party product in Japan)

 ▶ Angle-measuring optoelectronic steering 
angle sensor (electrical power-assisted 
steering)

Thus a total of four tracks are required for 
the determination of a precise and unam-
biguous angle of rotation w. The steering 
angle and TAS (Torque Angle Sensor) steer-
ing-angle sensor illustrated in Figure 9 thus 
requires a total of eight tracks, which are 
read optoelectronically, to measure two 
 angles w1 and w2. Its angular precision over 
360° is 1°, the angular resolution is 0.0055°, 
the resolution of the difference angle Dw is 
0.0044° with a measuring range of + 9°.

 

Eddy-current sensors 
Two slotted sleeves of electrically con-
ducting aluminum are attached to each 
end of a sufficiently long section of the 
measuring shaft. These are inserted one 
inside the other (Fig. 11). Each sleeve is 
provided with two rows of slots so that 
when the shaft is twisted, it becomes in-
creasingly visible through one row of slots, 
and is hidden more and more by the other 
row. This leads to increasing, or decreas-
ing, damping of the two high-frequency 
coils (approx. 1 MHz) situated above each 
row of slots so that coil inductance also 
varies accordingly. The slotted sleeves

288  |  Sensor measuring principles  |  Flowmeters

Flowmeters 

Measured variables
The purpose of flow measurement in the 
motor vehicle is the detection of the intake 
air flow rate. This air flow rate must be 
known precisely so that the engine-man-
agement system – both in diesel and in 
gasoline engines – can set a defined air-
fuel mixture. This value can be determined 
by a flowmeter. The sensors which are 
used for measuring air flow rate or gas 
flows in general are also referred to as 
 “anemometers”.

As such, the often-used term “air quan-
tity” is incorrect because it does not stipu-
late whether volume or mass is concerned. 
Since the chemical processes involved in 
fuel combustion are clearly based on mass 
relationships, the object of the measure-
ment is the mass of intake air. On gasoline 
engines, the air-mass flow rate is the most 
important load parameter. In diesel en-
gines, the exhaust-gas recirculation rate  
is regulated using the air-mass flow. 

Depending upon engine power, the aver-

age (over time) maximum air-mass flow 
rate to be measured is between 400 and 
1,200 kg/h. Due to the low air require-
ments at engine idle in modern gasoline 
engines, the ratio of minimum to maximum

flow is 1:50 to 1:100. Because of the higher 
idle air demand in diesel engines, these 
 ratios must be assumed to be 1:20 to 1:40. 
The severe exhaust gas and fuel-consump-
tion requirements dictate accuracies of  
2 to 3 % of the measured value. Referred  
to the measuring range, this can easily 
correspond to a measuring accuracy of 
2?10-4, which is unusually high for a motor 
vehicle.

The air though, is not drawn in continu-
ously by the engine, but rather in time with 
the opening of the intake valves. Particu-
larly with the throttle valve wide open 
(WOT) in gasoline engines, this leads to 
considerable pulsation of the air-mass 
flow, also at the measuring point which is 
always in the intake tract between air filter 
and throttle valve, or between air filter and 
turbocharger (Fig. 1). Intake-manifold res-
onance leads to the pulsation in the mani-
fold sometimes being so pronounced that 
brief return flows can occur. This applies 
in particular to 4-cylinder engines in 
which there is no overlap of the air-intake 
phases. An accurate flowmeter must be 
 capable of registering these return flows 
with the correct direction.

On a 4-cylinder engine, the pulsations 

are generated at twice the crankshaft 
speed. This means that they can easily be 
in the range 50 to 100 Hz. With a flowme-
ter featuring a linear characteristic curve 
and a narrower frequency bandwidth than 
above, it would suffice for it to follow the 
mean value of these rapidly fluctuating air 
flows. The mean value is in any case posi-
tive, so that the meter need not necessarily 
detect the correct sign. 

Practically all of the air-mass meters ac-
tually in use feature a characteristic curve 
which is far from linear, so that the mea-
surement signal must be linearized elec-
tronically before it can be evaluated. 
 Averaging before linearization can lead  
to significant dynamic errors (mean-value 
errors). This fact means that such air-mass 
meters must be sufficiently rapid in follow-
ing the pulsations which mostly have a

pronounced non-sinusoidal characteristic, 
and therefore also have a considerable 
harmonic content. This necessitates a 
bandwidth of about 1,000 Hz. Apart from 
this considerable bandwidth, the air-mass 
meters must also have a high switch-on 
time constant in order for them to be able 
to measure correctly during the engine 
starting phase.

As is the case in all flowmeters, those 
used in the motor vehicle are calibrated 
for flow through a pipe with a symmetrical 
flow profile. This means that a flow with a 
velocity vector v at practically any point of 
the flow cross-section of area A depends 
only on the radius to the central axis, and 
not on the angle at the circumference. The 
flow profile (laminar or turbulent, Fig. 2)  
is related to the Reynolds number Re:

Re = v?D/h   
where 
D  typical cross-section dimension and 
h  kinematic ductility of the medium.

The flow profiles illustrated by way of ex-
ample only establish themselves after the 
flow has been uniformly formed for some 
time. In the motor vehicle, a profile lying 

between the laminar and turbulent profiles 
illustrated will be established for the case 
of laminar flow – caused by the short in-
flow. The laminar or turbulent characteris-
tic of the flow profile depends on whether 
Re is below or above a value of approxi-
mately 1,200. 

A further important influencing factor is 
the degree of turbulence in the flow, which 
is determined by the aerodynamic design 
of the inflow to the flowmeter. If the lami-
nar-turbulent transition is within the mea-
suring range, marked irregularity of the 
characteristic curve can be expected at 
this point. As far as motor vehicle applica-
tions go, a purely turbulent flow (square 
profile: v = constr) cannot be assumed at 
the smallest air masses (gasoline engine 
idling). A careful design of the inflow, to 
achieve square profiles even in the event 
of laminar flow, is then necessary. 

Assuming a homogeneous density r, and 

assuming a square profile, the flow is sim-
ple to calculate as follows:

Whereas in measurement techniques, 
long, straight, advance and overshoot 
 sections of constant cross-section are 
 stipulated in order to guarantee a sym-
metrical profile, such conditions cannot  
be complied with in a vehicle’s cramped 
under-hood installation space. If pro-
nounced asymmetries occur, the flowme-
ter must be calibrated as a function of the 
actual installation conditions.

Measuring principles
Up to now, of the practically unlimited 
 variety of flowmeters on the market, only 
those which operate according to the im-
pact-pressure principle have come to the 
forefront for air-quantity measurement in 
the vehicle. This principle still depends 
upon mechanically moving parts, and in 
principle correction measures are still 
needed to compensate for density fluctua-
tions. 

Today, true air-mass meters applying 
thermal methods (hot-wire or hot-film air 
flowmeters) are used which can follow 
sudden flow changes without mechanically 
moving parts.

Variable orifice plates (sensor plates)
The calculation of the pressure drop across 
fixed orifice plates is based on two physical 
laws:

Continuity equation:

r?1?v1?A1 = r?2?v2?A2 = const

Bernoulli’s equation:

1 
 
p1 + ___ ?r1?v1
2

2 = p2 + ___ ?r2?v2

2 = const

These laws are to be applied for two different 
measuring cross-sections A1 and A2 (Fig. 3). 
Assuming constant density r = r1 = r2, this 
results in the pressure drop:

 
Dp = QV

This pressure drop can be measured either 
directly with a differential-pressure sensor, 
or by means of the force acting against a 
so-called sensor plate. It should be noted 
here that impact-pressure gages of this 
type measure a flow value that corresponds 
neither to the volume flow rate nor to the 
mass flow rate, but to a geometrical mean 
value of the two:

Because of the square relationship to the 
flow rate, fixed orifice plates permit only a 
variation in measured variable of 1:10, as 
otherwise the accuracy of the differential 
pressure recording is no longer adequate 
and significant pressure losses would result 
which would lead to power losses in the en-
gine. When larger ranges are to be covered, 
several orifice plates must be used, or such 
versions which automatically adapt them-
selves to the measuring range by opening 
up a larger flow cross-section A2 in line with 
the impact pressure. 

With such variable, moving sensor 
plates it is an easy matter to increase the 
variation to 1:100. Here, the increasing 
air flow causes the sensor plate to be de-
flected (usually against a constant coun-
terforce) into an area whose cross-section 
is specifically shaped so that the resulting 
deflection/angle relationship complies 
with the desired characteristic. In other 
words,  linear for K-Jetronic and non-linear 
for L-Jetronic. The sensor plate’s (Fig. 4) 
setting is then a measure for the air flow 
which is in relationship to the impact pres-
sure defined above. 

The limit frequency for such sensors is 
typically approx. 10 Hz. Such sensor plates 
though are unable to follow the high pulsa-
tion frequencies which often occur. From 
the point of view of the pulsation, they can 
be regarded as fixed orifice plates with a 
square-law characteristic curve. Under 
certain load conditions this leads to con-
siderable mean-value errors which can 
only be compensated for roughly by the 
use of suitable software.

If the density r of the intake air changes 
because of temperature fluctuations or the 
altitude, the measurement signal here will 
only change by √
sensor and a barometric pressure sensor 
must also be used to determine the density 
fluctuation fully.

––r. An air-temperature 

Hot-wire/hot-film anemometers
When current IH flows through a thin wire 
with electrical resistance R, its tempera-
ture increases. If at the same time a me-
dium with density r flows across it at ve-
locity v, a balance is set up between the 
electrical power input Pel and the power PV 
drawn off by the air flow, whereby

Pel = IH

2?R = PV = c1?l?Dq

Here, the power drawn off by the air flow 
is proportional to the temperature differ-
ence Dq established and the coefficient of 
thermal conductivity l. The following ap-
plies in close approximation:

l = √

Although l is primarily a function of the 
mass flow QLM, with the static medium at 
standstill (v = 0), a certain heat loss takes 
place (convection) represented by the ad-
ditive constant c2. This results in the famil-
iar interrelationship between the heating 
current IH and the mass flow QLM.

2?R, 

With the supply of a constant heat IH
a temperature rise Dq decreasing recipro-
cally with the root of the air-mass flow QLM 
would establish itself. If, on the other 
hand, the heating current IH is controlled 
such that a constant temperature increase 
(for instance, Dq = 100 K) is maintained 
even when the flow rate increases, this will 
lead to a heating current which increases 
approximately with the fourth root of the 
mass flow, and at the same time serves as a 
measure for the mass flow. 

The advantage of such a control loop lies 

in the fact that the electrical heating resis-
tor always remains at the same tempera-
ture so that its heat content need not be 
changed by means of time-wasting heat 
transfer. In fact, with a 70 µm platinum 
wire for instance, it is possible to achieve 

292  |  Sensor measuring principles  |  Flowmeters

time constants in the 1 ms range for 
changes in air-flow rate. In cases where 
closed-loop control is not used the time 
constants would be 40 to 100 times higher. 

If the heater temperature were to be main-
tained constant simply by keeping its (tem-
perature-dependent) resistance constant, 
with constant mass flow and higher me-
dium temperature, this would result in a 
current drop and therefore a false mea-
surement. In practice, this error is avoided 
by using a bridge circuit containing a sec-
ond high-ohm compensation resistor RK of 
the same type (e.g. platinum). Here, the 
heating resistor is kept at a constant over-
temperature Dq compared to the medium 
(Fig. 5) by a control loop. In case of a sud-
den jump in the medium temperature, the 
sensor reacts with a long time constant 
since in this case the heat content of the 
hot wire must be changed. The heating 
current generates a control voltage UM 
proportional to the air-mass flow on a pre-
cision resistor (measuring resistor RM).
The heating resistors in the first air-
mass meters (hot-wire air-mass meters) 
used for automotive applications were of 
very fine platinum wire. This wire was 
stretched in trapezoidal form across the 
flow cross-section so that it was able to 

 average out any asymmetries in the flow 
profile (Fig. 6). Adequate service lives only 
became possible when the platinum wire 
was stabilized by alloy additives so that  
its resistance no longer changed due to 
 deposits and cracks on its surface. This 
meant though that the deposits on the hot 
wire had to be burned-off automatically 
(approximately 1,000 °C) following every 
 operating phase.

Notwithstanding a number of functional 
advantages, this sensor concept was far 
too costly. A thick-film version (HFM2 hot-
film air-mass meter) was able to combine 
all the resistors concerned with the mea-
surement on a single ceramic substrate. 
Due to the ceramic substrate’s consider-
able thermal capacity, it was difficult not to 
exceed the maximum permissible switch-
ing constants. Furthermore, a complicated 
saw cut had to be made to reduce the un-
desirable heat coupling between heating 
and compensation resistors. On the other 
hand though, this version permitted the 
burn-off process to be dispensed with since 
the special flow conditions no longer led to 
unwanted deposits.

In contrast to both its predecessor 
types, a further silicon-based microme-
chanical version (HFM5 and HFM6 hot-

this flowmeter must ensure that the partial 
flow it measures represents the same frac-
tion of the total flow throughout the whole 
measuring range. This precondition can be 
achieved by means of a flow rectifier (grill) 
built into the measuring pipe.

film air-mass meters) fulfilled practically 
all  expectations. In particular, this version 
is able to measure in both flow directions 
with the correct sign (Fig. 7). This means 
that the brief return flows that occur as a 
result of pulsation no longer lead to mea-
suring errors (Fig. 8).

To this end, in addition to the heater 
control circuit used in the previous ver-
sions, a temperature sensor is located on 
each side of the heating resistor, in other 
words upstream and downstream. This 
principle is similar to the Thomas process 
often encountered in the literature. When 
there is no flow (QML = 0), each of these 
sensors indicates the same temperature. 
When flow starts though, since the up-
stream sensor is cooled by the medium, 
the higher the flow the higher the temper-
ature difference between the two resistors. 
The output signal derived from the tem-
perature difference has a similar charac-
teristic curve to the anemometers used up 
to now, whereby its sign is a clear indica-
tion of the flow direction.

Due to its small size, the micromechani-
cal flowmeter is only a partial-flowmeter. 
In other words, it is no longer in any way 
able to average-out any non-homogeneity 
in the flow velocity as a function of the 
flow cross-sectional area. Rather,

Gas sensors and 
concentration sensors

Measured variables
The concentration of a given material or 
medium defines the mass or volume per-
cent of a given material in another given 
material or in a mixture or combination of 
other materials. With a concentration sen-
sor (also known as a concentration probe, 
the important thing is that in the ideal case 
it is sensitive to only one medium, while at 
the same time practically “ignoring” all 
other mediums. Of course, in practice, ev-
ery concentration sensor has its own cross 
sensitivity to other mediums even though, 
as is often the case, “temperature” and 
“pressure” are maintained constant. 

In the vehicle, the following parameters 

must be measured:
▶   Oxygen content in the exhaust gas 
(closed-loop combustion control, 
 catalytic-converter monitoring)

▶   Carbon-monoxide and nitrogen-oxide 
content, as well as air humidity inside 
the vehicle (air quality, misting of vehi-
cle windows)

▶   Humidity in the compressed-air brake 

system (air-drier monitoring)

▶   Dampness of the outside air (black ice 

warning)

▶   Concentration of soot in diesel-engine 
exhaust gas. A still unsolved problem.  
In contrast to the above-mentioned gas 
concentrations, this is a particle concen-
tration. The difficulties inherent in the 
measuring assignment are further ag-
gravated by the possibility of the sensor 
being blocked by particles so that it no 
longer functions. 

The introduction of the fuel cell as an auto-
motive drive means that further gas sen-
sors will have to be developed, for instance 
for the detection of hydrogen.

Measuring principles
Measured mediums occur in gaseous, liquid, 
or solid state, so that in the course of time 
countless measuring methods have been de-
veloped. For automotive applications, until 
now only the gas-analysis area, and in par-
ticular the measurement of gaseous humid-
ity, has been of any interest. Table 1 presents 
an overview of the processes applied in gen-
eral measurement techniques.

Gas measurement in general
Gas sensors are usually in direct unpro-
tected contact with the monitored medium 
(in other words with foreign matter) so 
that the danger of irreversible damage 
 exists. This form of damage is referred to 
as sensor “contamination”. For instance, 
the lead that may be contained in fuel or 
the exhaust gas can make the electrolytic 
oxygen concentration sensors (Lambda 
oxygen sensors) unusable. 

Moisture measurement
In addition to the outstanding significance 
of the Lambda oxygen sensor in dealing 
with exhaust gases, moisture measurement 
also plays an important role.

In the broader sense, moisture indicates 
the moisture content of gaseous, liquid, or 
solid substances. In the narrower sense, 
we are dealing here with the gaseous-wa-
ter (water vapor) content in gaseous media – 
above all in the air.

When a damp gas is cooled in an isobaric 
process, it reaches its saturation point at  
a specific temperature (known as the dew 
point t).

For low-cost applications (for instance in 
the vehicle), resistive and capacitive sen-
sors are used almost exclusively. They are 
provided with hygroscopic layers which 
can store water as a function of the relative 
humidity (and release it again), and thus 
trigger a usually drastic change in a resis-
tor’s value or in the value of a planar ca-
pacitor.

be the mounting wafer, serves as the 
 dielectric of a capacitor. Either one of the 
electrodes is permeable to water, or the 
electrodes have a comb-like structure 
(Fig. 2). With increasing humidity, the 
 dielectric absorbs more water and the 
 sensor’s capacitance increases consider-
ably (relative dielectric constant of water 
«rW ≈ 81, Fig. 3).

In the case of the resistive sensor, an insu-
lation substrate is coated with a layer of 
hygroscopic salt (LiCi) held in a paste 
binder and located between an electrode 
pair. The layer’s conductivity changes 
drastically along with the relative humidity 
(Fig. 3). Unfortunately this resistance 
change is also highly dependent upon tem-
perature so that normally compensation  
is needed. The dew point can also be de-
fined, and with it the absolute humidity,  
by an additional measurement of the air 
temperature. The typical time constants  
of these sensors are about 30 s.

Table 2 gives an overview of the numerous 
measurement processes that have been 
developed in the course of time for humid-
ity measurement.

298  |  Sensor measuring principles  |  Temperature sensors

Temperature sensors

Measured variables
Temperature is defined as a nondirectional 
quantity which characterizes the energy 
state of a given medium, and which can be 
a function of time and location:
T = T (x, y, z, t) 
where: x, y, z are the spatial coordinates, 
t is time, and T is measured according to 
the Celsius or Kelvin scale.

(1)

Generally speaking, with monitored media 
which are in gaseous or liquid form, mea-
surements can be taken at any point. In the 
case of solid bodies, measurement is usu-
ally restricted to the body’s surface. With 
the most commonly used temperature sen-
sors, in order for it to assume the medi-
um’s temperature as precisely as possible, 
the sensor must be directly in contact with 
the monitored medium (direct-contact 
thermo meter). In special cases though, 
proximity or non-contacting temperature 
sensors are in use which measure the me-
dium’s temperature by means of its (infra-
red) thermal radiation (radiation ther-
mometer =  Pyrometer, thermal camera).

Generally speaking, a temperature sensor 
should reflect this dependency correctly, 
in other words, it should reflect as accu-
rately as possible the local distribution of 
the temperature and its change as a func-
tion of time. 

In special cases, possibly for functional 
reasons, this stipulation can be relaxed 
somewhat. The call for high local resolu-
tion and for high-speed response both de-
mand that the sensor should be as small as 
possible, since it should not falsify the 
temperature readings by itself absorbing 
heat. In other words it should have a low 
thermal capacity. 

In order to ensure that the temperature 

assumed by the sensor remains indepen-
dent of the usually very different temper-
ature of its mounting, it should be ther-
mally well insulated from it. Since this 
also falsifies the measurement, the heat 
developed by the majority of sensors in 
the active state should be kept to a mini-
mum (e.g. < 1 mW).

The temperature sensor’s dynamic re-
sponse is specified by the time constant t. 
This defines the time taken by the sensor 
to reach 63 %, 90 %, or 99 % of its final 
reading when subjected to a jump in 
 temperature. This time depends not only 
upon the sensor’s thermal capacity, but 
also to a great extent upon the heat-trans-
fer coefficient between the sensor and  
the monitored medium. The higher it is, 
the faster the sensor reaches its final 
reading. Naturally, this figure is far higher 
for liquid mediums than for gaseous me-
diums. It must also be noted that the heat-
transfer coefficient is highly influenced 
by any flow velocity y in the medium. It 
––
increases with approximately √
y. In other 
words, the time constant of a temperature 
sensor should always be specified with 
reference to a specific flow velocity of a 
defined medium.

Table 1

Sensor measuring principles  |  Temperature sensors  |  299

Temperature measurement in the vehicle 
makes use almost exclusively of the tem-
perature-dependence of electrical resis-
tance material with positive (PTC) or nega-
tive (NTC) temperature coefficient. The 
 direct-contact thermometers apply this 
pheno mena. For the most part, the conver-
sion of the temperature change to an ana-
log voltage takes place by adding a second 
resistor to form a voltage divider (which 
also has a linearizing effect). Recently 
though, non-contacting  (pyrometric) tem-
perature sensing has been considered for 
occupant-protection (passenger-position 
monitoring for airbag triggering), and for 
comfort and convenience (air conditioning 
in accordance with skin-temperature mea-
surement, prevention of windscreen mist-
up). It needed the advent of microsystem 
technology for this (pyrometric) method to 
become feasible from the costs viewpoint. 
Table 1 presents a listing of the tempera-
tures which have to be measured in the 
 vehicle.

It is not only the highly differing measur-
ing ranges that demand a variety of differ-
ent sensor concepts and technologies, but 
the different accuracies and dynamic re-
sponse requirements also lead to very dif-
ferent sensor shapes. At many locations, 
temperature is also measured in order 
that it can be compensated in cases where 
temperature variations trigger faults or 
act as an undesirable influencing variable.

Measuring principles for  
direct-contact sensors
The fact that practically all physical pro-
cesses are temperature-dependent means 
that there are almost just as many methods 
for making temperature measurements. 
The preferable methods though are those 
in which the temperature effect is very dis-
tinctive and dominant and as far as possi-
ble features a linear characteristic curve. 
Furthermore, the measuring elements 
should be suitable for inexpensive mass-
production, whereby they should be ade-
quately reproducible and non-aging. 
 Taking these considerations into account, 
the following sensor techniques have come 
to the forefront, some of which are also 
 applied in automotive technology:

Resistive sensors
In the form of 2-pole elements, tempera-
ture-dependent electrical resistors are par-
ticularly suitable for temperature measure-
ment, no matter whether in wire-wound, 
sintered ceramic, foil, thin-film, thick-film, 
or monocrystalline form. Normally, in or-
der to generate a voltage-analog signal 
they are combined with a fixed resistor RV 
to form a voltage divider, or load-indepen-
dent current is applied (Fig. 1). The volt-
age-divider circuit changes the original 
sensor characteristic R(T) to a slightly 
 different characteristic U(T):

R(T)
 
U(T) = U0 · –––––––––––––– 
R(T) + RV
 

On the other hand, the application of a 
supply current I0 permits the resistor 
curve to be reproduced exactly:

U(T) = I0 · R(T) 

(2)

(3)

The measurement sensitivity is reduced 
more or less depending upon the con-
struction of the voltage-divider circuit. 
Notwithstanding this fact, in the case of 
 resistance characteristics which display a

slightly progressive curve it does have a 
linearization influence (an effect which is 
usually very welcome). Very often, in this 
connection, the auxiliary resistor is so di-
mensioned that it equals the measuring re-
sistor at a given reference temperature T0 
(e.g. 20 °C): 

RV ≈ R (T0) 

(4)

If the precision is inadequate, a resistance 
sensor can be calibrated to the setpoint 
value both with regard to its resistance (re-
ferred to a reference temperature), and its 
temperature coefficient (TC), by means of 
an adjustable parallel resistor RP and a 
 serial resistor RS (Fig. 2). Of course, when 
fixed resistors are added the TC is reduced 
and the characteristic changes somewhat.

Sintered-ceramic NTC resistors
As a result of their pronounced measuring 
effects and inexpensive manufacture, the 
most common semiconductor resistors in 
use are based on heavy-metal oxides and 

oxidized mixed crystals. These are sin-
tered in bead form or disc form (Fig. 3) and 
have a polycrystalline structure. Because 
of their very steep temperature curve, they 
are also known as NTC resistors or therm-
istors. To a good approximation, and by 
applying the exponential law, their charac-
teristic curve can be defined as follows:

 
 
R(T ) = R0 · e 

 

B · (–– – ––   ) 

1  1
T    T0

(5)

Where R0 = R(T0), 
B = 2,000 to 5,000 K = const,
T absolute temperature

Here, the characteristic-curve gradient 
(TC) or the percentage resistance change 
as a function of temperature, is highly 
 dependent upon the working point.  
This means that it can only be defined  
at given points: 

TC = – B/T 2

It reduces considerably along with increas-
ing temperature, and the resistance value 
itself frequently varies by 4 to 5 powers of 
ten, e.g. typically from a few 100 kΩ to a 
few 10 Ω. This pronounced temperature-
dependence means that applications are 
 restricted to a “window” of about 200 K. 
This though can be selected in the range 
from –40 to approximately 850 °C. Tighter 
tolerances of up to ± 0.5 K at a given refer-
ence point are complied with by using a se-
lection process, or possibly even by grind-
ing in oil, a method which of course has an 
affect upon costs. The aging stability of 
these sensors has been vastly improved 
compared to earlier versions which means 
that it is quite possible for the very close 
tolerances to apply throughout the sensor’s 
useful life.

PTC thin-film/thick-film metallic resistors
The thin-film metallic resistors placed with 
two additional temperature-neutral cali-
bration resistors on a common substrate 
wafers have particularly high accuracy val-
ues. They can be tightly toleranced in re-
spect of their characteristic curve and can 
be manufactured to be stable over the long 
term and are additionally trimmed by laser 
cuts. The use of layer technology makes it 
possible to adapt the substrate (ceramic, 
glass, plastic foil) and the upper layers 
(plastic molding or paint, sealed foil, glass 
and ceramic coatings) to the respective 
 application, and thus provide protection 
against the monitored medium. Although 
metallic layers are less sensitive to thermal 
variations than the ceramic-oxide semi-
conductor sensors, both linearity and re-
producibility are better: The following ap-
plies for the computational definition of 
these sensors:

Even though the b coefficient is generally 
very small for metals, it cannot be ignored 
completely. This is why the measurement 
sensitivity of such sensors is usually char-
acterized by means of a mean TC, the  
“TC 100”. The TC 100 corresponds to the 
mean curve gradient between 0 °C and 
100 °C (Table 2 and Figure 4).

Although platinum (Pt) resistors have the 
lowest TC, they are not only the most pre-
cise resistive temperature sensors, but can 
also boast the best aging stability. They are 
available on the market under the designa-
tion “PT 100” or “PT 1000” (100 Ω or 
1,000 Ω nominal resistance at a reference 
temperature of 20 °C) in a variety of differ-
ent tolerance classes (up to 0.1  °C) (Fig. 5). 
At temperatures up to about 1,000 °C, 
thick-film platinum sensors are suitable 
whose platinum layer has been stabilized 
by special additives.

Thick-film resistors (PTC/NTC)
Thick-film pastes with both high resis-
tance (low surface-area requirement) and 
positive and negative temperature coeffi-
cients are generally employed as tempera-
ture sensors for compensation purposes. 
They have a non-linear characteristic 
curve (which though is not as “bent” as  
the curve of the solid NTC resistors), and 
are suitable for laser-trimming. The mea-
suring effect is improved by forming 
 voltage-divider  circuits from NTC and  
PTC materials.

Monocrystalline silicon semiconductor 
 resistors (PTC)
Basically speaking, with temperature sen-
sors of monocrystalline semiconductor 
materials such as silicon (Si), it is possible 
to incorporate further active and passive 
circuit elements on the sensor chip (initial 
signal conditioning at the measuring 
point). Due to the closer tolerances in-
volved, their production uses the “spread-
ing resistance” principle (Fig. 6a). The cur-
rent flows through the measuring resistor 
and through a surface-point contact before 
arriving at the silicon bulk material. It then 
proceeds, widely distributed, to a counter-

electrode covering the base of the sensor 
chip. In addition to the high reproducibil-
ity material constants, the high current 
density behind the contact point (high ac-
curacy thanks to photolithographic pro-
duction) mainly defines the sensor’s resis-
tance. In order to make the sensor highly 
independent of polarity, these sensors are 
usually series-connected in pairs in oppo-
site alignments (dual-hole version, Fig. 6). 
The base electrode can be in the form of  
a temperature contact (no electrical func-
tion).

Thermocouples
Thermocouples are used in particular for 
measuring ranges ≥ 1,000 °C. They rely on 
the Seebeck effect, according to which 
there is a voltage across the ends of a me-
tallic conductor when these are at differ-
ent temperatures T1 and T2. This “thermo-
electric voltage” Uth depends (independently 
of the development of this) exclusively on 
the temperature difference ∆T at the ends 
of the conductors (Fig. 8). It is expressed 
by the equation:

Measurement sensitivity is practically dou-

Uth = c (T2 – T1 ) = c ∆T,  

(9)

ble that of a Pt resistor (TC = 7.73 · 10–3/K). 
The progressive bend of the temperature 
curve is more pronounced than on a metal-
lic sensor. The measuring range is limited 
to approx. +150 °C by the material’s intrin-
sic conductivity (Fig. 6b). There are special 
versions (Fig. 7) available for uses up to 
300 °C.

where the proportionality constant is ma-
terial-specific and termed the Seebeck 
 coefficient. 

Since the instrument leads used to mea-

sure this voltage across the metallic con-
ductor must themselves be equipped with 
terminals (for instance made of copper),

these are also subject to the same temper-
ature difference, so that unfortunately 
only the difference between the metallic 
conductor and the connecting cables is 
measured. Thermoelectric voltages are 
 always listed based on Platinum as the 
 reference material (Table 3). 

In order that the generated voltages are 

as high as possible, a number of material 
pairs have established themselves (Fig. 9, 
e.g. iron/constantan etc.). It is important 
that the “limbs” of such a thermocouple 
are joined at the end to which the heat is 
applied in such a manner that the joint is 
electrically conductive (by means of twist-
ing, welding, soldering, etc., Fig. 10). 

Thermocouples themselves are usually 
short, and the extensions up to the point 
where the signal is captured can be made 
with compensating cables which use the 
same material pair as in the thermocouple 
itself. It is important that both free ends  

of the thermoelement configuration are at 
the same (reference) temperature, other-
wise the temperature difference at the free 
ends will also be included in the measure-
ment. Thermocouples, therefore, always 
measure only the temperature difference 
to a given reference point. If the measur-
ing point’s absolute temperature is to be 
measured, other devices (such as resistive 
sensors) must be used to also measure the 
temperature at the reference point. 

The characteristic curve of the thermo-
electric voltage against temperature is usu-
ally not as linear as that given in equation 
(9). The sensor signals are usually small, and 
ICs are used for their amplification and for 
their linearization. In order to increase the 
measurement voltage, it is common practice 
to connect a number of identical thermocou-
ples in series. These have their “hot” junc-
tions at the temperature to be measured, 
and their “cold” junctions at the reference 
temperature (Fig. 11, thermopile).

Although thermocouples are robust (for 
instance, high-level EMC due to low inter-
nal resistance), they are not particularly 
accurate as a measuring device. Their 
 deviation can easily be in the 5° to 15 °C 
range, and they are not outstanding re-
garding their resistance to aging, which 
means that individual calibration does  
not result in a permanent improvement  
of their accuracy.

Of course, thermocouples can be manu-

factured using both thin-film and thick-
film techniques. Metallic films stacked one 
on top of the other provide for excellent 
thermal contact, and extremely small ther-
mocouples can be produced by applying 
microsystem technology. Thermocouples 
are particularly suitable for use in thermo-
piles comprised for instance from 50 to 
100 individual thermocouples. They are 
used in non-contacting radiation ther-
mometers (pyrometers).

Semiconductor depletion layers
Presuming a constant current, the forward 
voltage of semiconductor depletion layers

basis-emitter path of a transistor, demon-

sensor, and may necessitate additional cal-
ibration elements in order for a precise 
measurement to be made. Above all, it is 
the temperature-dependent saturation 
current Isat which is responsible for the 
negative temperature coefficient (NTC). 
This current increases dramatically with 
rising temperature. Here, the silicon’s in-
trinsic conductivity limits this sensor’s ap-
plication to temperature ranges <150 °C. 
Sometimes, emitter-coupled transistor 
pairs are used in a similar manner for tem-
perature measurement. With this form of 
temperature measurement, the ratios of 
the collector currents to each other repre-
sent a very good reproducible measure for 
the temperature. Usually, an integrated 
supplementary circuit is used for the  
“on-chip” conversion to an analog output 
voltage. 

Zener diodes operated in the reverse di-
rection can also be used as highly practical 
temperature sensors. Their voltage changes 
are highly dependent upon the Zener volt-
age. Here, the option exists of various lev-
els of voltage reduction at Zener voltages 
<4.7 V, and voltage increases at Zener volt-
ages >4.7 V.

Such sensors are often used for temper-

ature compensation on the chip itself.

Where:
Isat = Isat (T) and IF = constant,

It is advantageous here when the sensor 
directly outputs a voltage which is a func-
tion of the temperature. The two-pole sen-
sor is of course dependent upon polarity. 
Whereas, for all sensors, the forward volt-
age decreases by almost exactly 2 mV/°C, 
the absolute voltage at each depletion 
layer differs considerably from sensor to

Measuring principles for non-contacting 
temperature measurement
The radiation emitted by a body is used for 
the non-contact measurement (pyrometry) 
of its temperature. This radiation is for the 
most part in the infrared (IR) range (wave-
length: 5 to 20 µm). Strictly speaking, the 
product of the radiated power and the 
emission coefficient of the body is mea-
sured. The latter is a function of the mate-
rial, but for materials which are technically 
of interest (including glass) it is usually 
around 1, although for reflective and IR-
permeable materials (e.g. air, silicon) it is 
far less than 1. 

The measuring point is reproduced on a 

radiation-sensitive element, which heats 
up slightly with respect to its environment 
(typically 0.01 to 0.001 °C). The element’s 
temperature is a measure for the tempera-

ture of the body being measured. A given 
temperature difference at the object often 
corresponds to only 1/1,000th of this dif-
ference at the measuring point. Neverthe-
less, the object’s temperature can be deter-
mined with an accuracy of 0.5 °C.

Bolometer
The Bolometer is a highly sensitive resis-
tance temperature sensor for measuring 
minute temperature increases (Fig. 13).  
A further sensor is needed for measuring 
the temperature of the sensor housing. If 
this device is to operate efficiently across  
a wide temperature range, it is necessary 
though for both these sensors to feature  
an extremely high degree of synchronism. 
The Bolometer housing is therefore usu-
ally thermostatically controlled (and well-
insulated to the housing) so that the pri-
mary detecting element (sensor) always 
operates at the same temperature.

Thermopile sensor
When a very extensive temperature range 
is concerned, it is more practical for the 
temperature difference generated by the 
radiation from the object to be measured 
using thermocouples. In order to increase 
the measuring effect, a number of thermo-
couples are connected in series (thermo-
pile). Such a thermopile sensor (Fig. 14) is 
inexpensive to manufacture micromechan-
ically. All its “hot” junctions are located on 
a thermally well insulated thin diaphragm,

sive curved mirror is usually ruled out due 
to it needing too much room. Glass lenses 
are impermeable for IR light, and plastic 
lenses can only be used for operating tem-
peratures of up to approx. 85 °C max. On 
the other hand, Si lenses are highly suit-
able for thermal radiation and up to diam-
eters of approx. 4 mm micromechanical 
techniques can be used to inexpensively 
manufacture them in the form of a Fresnel 
or refraction lens. Fitted in the cover of  
a TO5 housing, these then also serve to 
protect the sensor against direct damage 
(Fig. 15). Even though filling the housing 
with an inert gas improves the crosstalk 
between the individual pixels, it also nega-
tively affects their response time.

and all its “cold” junctions are in contact 
with the thicker chip rim (heat sink). Typi-
cally, the sensor’s response time is approx. 
20 ms. Using such a so-called “single-pixel 
sensor”, it is an easy matter to determine 
the windshield’s surface temperature so 
that measures can be taken to prevent 
misting should the temperature fall below 
the dew point.

Single-point sensors, imaging sensors
If a number of pixels are combined on a 
single chip (e.g. 4 x 4) to form an array,  
this provides the basis for a rough form  
of image analysis (Fig. 16). However, there 
should not be too much insensitive surface 
area between the pixels and the pixels 
themselves must be thermally well insu-
lated against each other. As all the pixels 
can optionally respond electrically, the 
chip has a large number of terminals. On  
a TO5 housing, for example, the ASIC for 
signal preamplification and series connec-
tion of the signal must be located directly 
adjacent to the sensor chip. Usually, in the 
case of thermopile sensors, this ASIC also 
includes a reference-temperature sensor 
which measures the pixel’s absolute tem-
perature. This permits object tempera-
tures to be measured with an accuracy  
of approx. ±0.5 K.

In order to reproduce a scene thermally 
on the sensor array, the array requires an 
IR optical imaging unit. The very inexpen-

Imaging sensors (video) 

In particular, imaging sensors are begin-
ning to gain a hold in the motor vehicle us-
ing visible light or infrared light. They can 
be used for passenger-compartment moni-
toring, but are principally aimed at obser-
vation outside the vehicle.

All of these sensors have one objective 

in view, and that is the simulation of the 
superior capabilities of the human eye  
and its mental recognition capabilities  
(of course, only to a very modest degree  
at first). These were introduced in large 
numbers to industrial measurements some 
time ago – in particular on robot handling 
equipment. The costs of imaging sensors, 
and the associated very high-performance 
processors needed for the interpretation 
of a scene, are already of interest for appli-
cations in the automotive sector.

In contrast to the human eye, common 
imaging sensors are sensitive in the near 
IR range (wavelength approximately 
1 mm). With appropriate non-visible 
IR illumination, therefore, all imaginable 
applications in the vehicle become feasi-
ble, including nighttime operation. For 
 applications in the visible light range, the 
imaging sensors generally have an IR filter 
in front of them to prevent false recordings 
due to color.

In future, imaging sensors will be able to 
play a highly variegated role for the obser-
vation of the vehicle’s interior (seating po-
sition, forward shift in case of a crash, size 
of seat occupants etc.), and of the vehicle’s 
surroundings (lane guidance, collision 
prevention, parking and reversing aids, 
road-sign recognition). A night vision de-
vice, that takes the IR image recorded for 
the road and displays it on a screen in the 
dashboard, thus offering enhanced driving 
safety in poor visibility (darkness, fog, etc.) 
is already in series production.

Imaging sensors are a special case of mul-
tisensor structures comprising light-sensi-
tive elements (photodiodes), arranged as 
pixels in a row or matrix form and receiv-
ing the light through a conventional imag-
ing optical system. In the case of the sili-
con imaging sensors principally available 
(CCD, Charge-Coupled Devices, Figs. 1 and 
2), free charge carriers are generated pro-
portionally to the intensity and exposure 
time by the light arriving through a trans-
parent electrode; they are then collected 
in a “potential pot” (Si-SiO2 boundary 
layer). Further electrodes move these 
charges into an opaque zone which are 
further transported in analog shift regis-
ters (bucket chain principle) line-by-line 
into an output register which is read seri-
ally at a high clock rate.

While CCD sensors can only be used in 
motor vehicles to a very limited degree 
because of their limited brightness/dark-
ness dynamics (50 dB), their read time and 
their temperature range (< 50 °C), newer, 
smart, imaging sensors based on CMOS 
technology appear to be fully suitable for 
use in the motor vehicle. The logarithmic 
brightness/signal curve possible here, 
corresponds to the human eye and has a 
dynamic response of 120 dB. This makes 
aperture control, for instance, unneces-
sary and supplies a constant contrast reso-
lution across the entire brightness range. 
These sensors permit a digitally controlled, 
random access to the individual pixels in 
a matrix sensor (Fig. 3) with simultaneous 
higher sensitivity (higher read rate).

The first steps in preprocessing the 
 signals on the imaging-sensor chip have 
 already been implemented (intelligent 
 imaging sensor). A resolution of 
1,280 × 1,024 pixels with typical indi- 
vidual dimensions of 6 µm × 6 µm is 
 already possible in sensors currently  
on the market.

Sensor types

Engine-speed sensors 

Application
Engine-speed sensors are used in engine-
management systems for
▶  Measuring the engine speed and
▶  Determining the crankshaft position 

(position of the pistons)

The engine speed is calculated from the in-
terval between the speed sensor’s signals. 

Inductive speed sensors
Design and operating principle
The sensor is mounted directly opposite a 
ferromagnetic pulse wheel (Fig. 1, Item 7) 
from which it is separated by a narrow air 
gap. It has a soft-iron core (pole pin, 4), 
which is enclosed by a winding (5). The 
pole pin is also connected to a permanent 
magnet (1), and a magnetic field extends 
through the pole pin and into the pulse 
wheel. The level of the magnetic flux 
through the coil depends on whether the 
sensor is opposite a pulse-wheel tooth  
or space. Whereas the magnet’s leakage 
flux is concentrated by a tooth, and leads 
to an increase in the magnetic flux through 
the coil, it is attenuated by a space. When 
the pulse wheel rotates, these changes in 
magnetic flux induce a sinusoidal output 
voltage in the coil which is proportional to 
the rate of change of the flux and thus the 

engine speed (Fig. 2). The amplitude of the 
alternating voltage increases strongly 
along with increasing pulse-wheel speed 
(several mV to >100 V). At least about  
30 rpm are needed to generate an ade-
quate amplitude. 

The number of teeth on the pulse wheel 
depends on the particular application. In 
Motronic systems, a 60-pitch pulse wheel 
is normally used, although 2 teeth are omit-
ted (Fig. 1, Item 7) so that the pulse wheel 
has 60 – 2 = 58 teeth. The space where the 
missing teeth would be situated is allocated 
to a defined crankshaft position and serves  
as a reference mark for synchronizing the 
control unit.

The geometries of the pulse-wheel teeth 
and the pole pin must be matched to each 
other. An evaluation circuit in the control 
unit converts the sinusoidal voltage, which 
is characterized by strongly varying ampli-
tudes, into a constant-amplitude square-
wave voltage for evaluation in the control 
unit microcontroller.

Active speed sensors
Active speed sensors operate according to 
the magnetostatic principle. The amplitude 
of the output signal is not dependent on the 
rotational speed. This makes it possible for 
very low speeds to be sensed (quasistatic 
speed sensing).

Differential Hall sensor
A voltage UH proportional to the magnetic 
field (Hall voltage) can be picked off hori-
zontally to the current direction at a cur-
rent-carrying plate which is permeated 
vertically by a magnetic induction B. In 
a differential Hall sensor, the magnetic 
field is generated by a permanent magnet 
(Fig. 3, Item 1). Two Hall sensor elements 
(2 and 3) are situated between the magnet 
and the pulse wheel (4). The magnetic flux 
by which these are permeated depends on 
whether the speed sensor is opposite a 
tooth or a space. Determining the differ-
ence between the signals from two sensors 
reduces the magnetic interference signals 
and achieves and improved signal/noise 
ratio. The edges of the sensor signal can  
be processed without digitization directly 
in the control unit. 

Multipole wheels are used instead of the 
ferromagnetic pulse wheel. Here, a magne-
tizable plastic is attached to a nonmagnetic 
metallic carrier and alternately magne-
tized. These north and south poles adopt 
the function formerly performed by the 
teeth of the pulse wheel. 

AMR sensors
The electrical resistance of magnetoresis-
tive material (AMR, Anisotrop Magneto 
Resistive) is anisotropic, i.e. it depends on 
the direction of the magnetic field to which 
it is exposed. This property is utilized in 
an AMR sensor. The sensor is located 
 between a magnet and a pulse wheel.  
The field lines change direction when the 
pulse wheel rotates (Fig. 4). This generates 
a sinusoidal voltage, which is amplified in 
an evaluation circuit in the sensor and 
converted into a square-wave signal. 

GMR sensors
The use of GMR technology (Giant Mag-
neto Resistive) is a further development  
of active speed sensors. Because of the 
higher sensitivity by comparison with the 
AMR sensors, larger air gaps are possible, 
which makes applications in difficult cir-
cumstances possible. The higher sensitiv-
ity also results in less background noise 
from the signal edges. 

All two-wire current interfaces previ-
ously used for Hall speed sensors may  
also be used on GMR sensors.

position is an indication as to whether the

piston is in the compression or exhaust 
stroke. The phase sensor on the camshaft 
provides the control unit with this infor-
mation. This is required, for example, for 
ignition systems with single-spark ignition 
coils and for sequential fuel injection (SEFI).

Design and operating principle
Hall rod sensors
Hall rod sensors (Fig. 1a) utilize the Hall 
effect: a rotor of ferromagnetic material  
(7, pulse wheel with teeth, segments or 
 aperture plate) rotates along with the cam-
shaft. The Hall IC (6) is located between 
the pulse wheel and a permanent magnet 
(5), which generates a magnetic field 
strength perpendicular to the Hall ele-
ment. 

If one of the pulse-wheel teeth (Z)  
now passes the current-carrying sensor 
 element (semiconductor wafer), it changes 
the magnetic-field strength perpendicular 
to the Hall element. This results in a volt-
age signal (Hall voltage) which is indepen-
dent of the relative speed between sensor 
and pulse wheel. The evaluation electron-
ics integrated in the sensor’s Hall IC condi-
tion the signal and output it in the form of a 
square-wave signal (Fig. 1b).

Sensor types  |  Speed sensors for transmission control  |  313

Because of the very compact design of the 
transmissions, the mechanical customer 
interface cannot generally be covered  
by standard geometries. This means that 
custom sensor types are needed for each 
transmission model. Module-integrated 
types differ in respect of insertion length, 
direction of recording and mounting 
flange (Fig. 1). A further variation found  
in stand-alone sensors is the location of 
the mounting socket and the design of  
the connector.

Hall ASICs (Application Specific Inte-
grated Circuit) with varying complexities 
of the evaluation algorithms are used to 
cover the complete range of the functional 
requirements (Fig. 2). 

If a ferromagnetic trigger wheel or  
a trigger area (toothed, stamped or em-
bossed) is available on the rotating trans-
mission component, the magnetic field 
 required to operate the Hall sensor is 
 generated by a back-bias magnet.

Speed sensors for 
 transmission control

Application
Transmission speed sensors determine 
the shaft speeds in AT, ASG, DKG and  
CVT transmissions. These are the turbine 
and output shaft speeds on AT transmis-
sions with a hydrodynamic torque con-
verter, the speed of the primary and sec-
ondary pulleys in CVT transmissions and 
the speeds of the two input shafts and the 
driven shaft of double-clutch transmis-
sions. The speed of the power take-up 
 element is also detected for high dynamic 
demands on power take-up control. 

Direction of rotation detection can also 
be necessary in high-end transmissions in 
order to optimize clutch management and 
for rollback prevention.

Both stand-alone sensors and sensors 
built into electronics modules which proj-
ect into the transmission from the outside 
or are mounted internally are used. 

Requirements
Transmission speed sensors are exposed 
to very severe operating stresses because 
of
 ▶ Extreme ambient temperatures between 

-40 and +150 °C

 ▶ An aggressive operating environment 
caused by the transmission oil, also 
known as ATF (contains special addi-
tives for transmissions and has a low 
condensate content)

 ▶ High mechanical stress with vibrational 

accelerations up to 30 g

 ▶ Abraded metallic materials and a build-

up of particles in the transmission

The package of the electronics used in the 
sensor is hence subject to high demands  
as a consequence of these severe stresses. 
A service life of more than 15 years in 
transmission oil has been achieved by 
 using a suitable oil-resistant package.

It is mounted in the sensor immediately 
behind the ASIC.

Compact transmissions increasingly 
require speed measurement over greater 
distances (magnetic air gap) by rotating, 
nonmagnetic components or through a 
housing wall. Multipole wheels (magne-
tized rings) are used for these applica-
tions, the back-bias magnet is omitted 
from the sensor. 

Design
The Hall ASICs used in the transmission 
speed sensors are mounted in a retainer 
with or without a back-bias magnet – 
 depending on the magnetic interface –  
with the electrical contact being made  
by a welding process, then inserted in  
a housing, potted with epoxy resin or – in 
the case of types mounted on the outside 
of the transmission – have an oil-tight en-
closure sprayed onto them (Fig. 3).

The sensor has a two-wire interface, 
which combines optimum diagnostic op-
tions with a minimum number of electrical 
connections. The two terminals both sup-
ply the Hall IC and transmit the signal.

Operating principle
Transmission speed sensors use the differ-
ential Hall effect. The difference between 
the Hall voltages from two Hall plates on 
the ASIC is determined. The majority of 
the similar interferences can be compen-
sated for in this way. The difference signal 
is first amplified on some ASIC types,  
then converted into a digital signal by 
 trigger algorithms of varying complexities. 
This constitutes the controlled variable for 
modulating the output current by means  
of a power source. A digital signal with  
two current levels (typically 7 mA for the

low level and 14 mA for the high level) is 
obtained, the modulation frequency of 
which corresponds to the frequency of 
tooth change on the trigger wheel and  
thus represents the speed of rotation.  
The sensor signal is evaluated in the elec-
tronic control unit by means of a measur-
ing shunt RM, which converts the sensor 
current IS into the signal voltage URM.

On principle, it does not matter for  
the operation of a differential Hall ASICs 
whether the sensor is operated with a 
steel trigger wheel or on a multipole 
wheel (Figs. 4a and 4b).

Some transmission controls include func-
tions that require detection of a standstill. 
For this application, the sensor must have 
as great an immunity as possible against 
vibration-induced variations in the air gap 
and the torsional vibration of the trigger 
wheel. This property of the sensor, known 
as immunity against vibration, can only  
be implemented to a very limited degree  
in differential Hall sensors with only two  
Hall plates, by the use of adaptive trigger 
thresholds, for example. Two phase-
shifted differential signals become avail-
able with the use of a third Hall plate.  
This makes both the detection of the di-
rection of rotation (Figs. 4c to f) and addi-
tional function algorithms for increasing 
immunity against vibration possible.

The typical values for “value” and “high 
feature” sensors differ in the air gap range 
achievable (distance between the sensitive 
area on the sensor and the trigger wheel), 
the signal frequency range and the addi-
tional functionalities implemented (Table 1).

The complexity of transmission type, 
mounting space restrictions including  
all the derived marginal design conditions 
and the functional requirements leads to 
application-specific solutions in most ap-
plications. These are characterized by a 
combination of ASIC, package design and 
sensor mechanical and magnetic interface 
suitable for the system requirements.

Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensor
A passive (inductive) speed sensor con-
sists of a permanent magnet (Fig. 2, 1) with 
a soft-magnetic pole pin (3) connected to 
it, which is inserted into a coil (2) with sev-
eral thousand windings. This setup gener-
ates a constant magnetic field.

The pole pin is installed directly above 
the pulse wheel (4), a gear wheel attached 
to the wheel hub. As the pulse wheel turns, 
the continuously alternating sequence of 
teeth and spaces induces corresponding 
fluctuations in the constant magnetic field. 
This changes the magnetic flux through 
the pole pin and therefore also through  
the coil winding. These fluctuations in the 
magnetic field induce an alternating volt-
age in the coil suitable for monitoring at 
the ends of its winding. 

The frequency and amplitude of this 
 alternating voltage are proportional to 
wheel speed (Fig. 3) and when the wheel is 
not rotating, the induced voltage is zero.

Tooth shape, air gap, rate of voltage rise, 

and the control unit input sensitivity de-
fine the smallest still measurable vehicle 
speed and thus, for ABS applications,  
the minimum response sensitivity and 
switching speed. 

1 Passive (inductive) wheel-speed sensors

Wheel-speed sensors

Application
Wheel-speed sensors are used to measure 
the rotational speed of the vehicle wheels 
(wheel speed). The speed signals are 
transmitted via cables to the ABS, TCS  
or ESP control unit of the vehicle which 
controls the braking force individually  
at each wheel. This control loop prevents 
the wheels from locking up (with ABS) or 
from spinning (with TCS or ESP) so that  
the vehicle’s stability and steerability are 
maintained.

Navigation systems also use the wheel-

speed signals to calculate the distance 
traveled (e.g. in tunnels or if satellite 
 signals are unavailable).

Design and operating principle
The signals for the wheel-speed sensor are 
generated by a steel pulse generator that  
is fixed to the wheel hub (for passive sen-
sors) or by a multipole magnetic pulse gen-
erator (for active sensors). This pulse gen-
erator has the same rotational speed as the 
wheel and moves past the sensitive area  
of the sensor head without touching it.  
The sensor “reads” without direct contact 
via an air gap of up to 2 mm (Fig. 2).

The air gap (with strict tolerances) en-
sures interference-free signal acquisition. 
Possible interference caused for instance 
by oscillation patterns in the vicinity of the 
brakes, vibrations, temperature, moisture, 
installation conditions at the wheel, etc. is 
therefore eliminated.

Since 1998 active wheel-speed sensors 
have been used almost exclusively with 
new developments instead of passive  
(inductive) wheel-speed sensors.

Various pole-pin configurations and 
 installation options are available to adapt 
the system to the different installation con-
ditions encountered with various wheels. 
The most common variants are the chisel-
type pole pin (Fig. 1a, also called a flat  
pole pin) and the rhombus-type pole pin  
(Fig. 1b, also called a lozenge-shaped pole 
pin). Both pole-pin designs necessitate 
precise alignment to the pulse wheel 
 during installation.

Active wheel-speed sensor
Sensor elements
Active wheel-speed sensors are used al-
most exclusively in today’s modern brake 
systems (Fig. 4). These sensors usually 
consist of a hermetic, plastic-cast silicon 
IC that sits in the sensor head. 

In addition to magnetoresistive ICs  
(the electrical resistance changes as the 
magnetic field changes) Bosch now uses 
Hall sensor elements almost exclusively. 
These sensors react to the smallest 
changes in the magnetic field and there-
fore allow greater air gaps compared to 
passive wheel-speed sensors.

Pulse wheels
A multipole ring is used as a pulse wheel 
for active wheel-speed sensors. The multi-
pole ring consists of alternately magne-
tized plastic elements that are arranged in 
the shape of a ring on a nonmagnetic metal 
carrier (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7a). These north and 
south poles adopt the function formerly 
performed by the teeth of the pulse wheel. 
The sensor IC is exposed to the continu-
ously changing fields generated by these 
magnets. The magnetic flux through the  
IC therefore changes continuously as the 
multipole ring turns.

A steel pulse wheel can also be used in-
stead of the multipole ring. In this case a 
magnet is mounted on the Hall IC that gen-
erates a constant magnetic field (Fig. 7b). 
As the pulse wheel turns, the continuously 
alternating sequence of teeth and spaces 
induces corresponding fluctuations in the 
constant magnetic field. The measuring 
principle, signal processing and IC are 
 otherwise identical to the sensor without  
a magnet.

Characteristics
A typical feature of the active wheel-speed 
sensor is the integration of a Hall measur-
ing element, signal amplifier and signal 
conditioning in an IC (Fig. 8). The wheel-
speed data is transferred as an impressed 
current in the form of square-wave pulses 
(Fig. 9). The frequency of the pulses is 
 proportional to the wheel speed and the 
speed can be detected until the wheel is 
practically stationary (0.1 km/h).

The supply voltage is between 4.5 and 
20 volts. The square-wave output signal 
level is 7 mA (low) and 14 mA (high).

This type of data transmission using digital 
signals is less sensitive to interference 
than the signals from passive inductive-
type sensors. The sensor is connected to

sensor suitable for installation on and even 
within the vehicle’s wheel-bearing assem-
blies (Fig. 10). Various standard sensor 
head shapes are suitable for this.

Digital signal conditioning makes it possi-
ble to transfer coded additional informa-
tion using a pulse-width-modulated output 
signal (Fig. 11):  
▶  Direction of wheel rotation recognition:
This is especially significant for the  
“hill hold control” feature, which relies 
on selective braking to prevent the vehi-
cle from rolling backwards during hill 
starts. The direction of rotation recogni-
tion is also used in vehicle navigation 
systems. 

▶  Standstill recognition: 

This information can also be evaluated  
by the “hill hold control” function.  
The information is also used for self-
 diagnosis.

▶  Signal quality of the sensor: 

Information about the signal quality of 
the sensor can be relayed in the signal.  
If a fault occurs the driver can be ad-
vised that service is required.

Micromechanical 
yaw-rate sensors

Applications
In vehicles with electronic stability pro-
gram (ESP), the rotation of the vehicle 
about its vertical axis is registered by mi-
cromechanical yaw-rate (or yaw-speed) 
sensors (also known as gyroscopes) and 
applied for vehicle-dynamics control.  
This takes place during normal cornering, 
for instance, but also when the vehicle 
breaks away or goes into a skid. These sen-
sors are reasonably priced as well as being 
very compact. They have forced out the 
conventional high-precision mechanical 
sensors.

A further area of application is rollover 
 detection in airbag electronic control units 
for triggering restraints (e.g. sidebags/win-
dow airbags, rollover bar) in the event of 
the vehicle rolling over. MM2 yaw-rate 
sensors have been specially developed  
for this area. These are particularly suited 
for the detection of rotary motion around 
the longitudinal axis because of their opti-
mized sensing direction. They permit a 
very compact design and space-saving in-
stallation in airbag control units, installed 
along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. 
Packaging the sensor element and the 
evaluation electronics together in a stan-
dard IC housing contributes to the cost 
 reductions in this area.

MM1 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
A mixed form of technology is applied  
in order to achieve the high accuracies 
needed for vehicle-dynamics systems. 
That is, two somewhat thicker oscillating 
elements (mass plates) which have been 
machined from a wafer using bulk micro-
mechanics oscillate in counter-phase to 
their resonant frequency which is defined 
by their mass and their coupling-spring 
stiffness (>2 kHz). On each of these oscil-
lating elements, there is a miniature, sur-
face-type micromechanical capacitive ac-
celeration sensor. When the sensor chip

below 40 dB). Here, the drive and mea-
surement systems are rigorously decou-
pled from each other.

MM2 micromechanical yaw-rate sensor
If the silicon yaw-rate sensor is manufac-
tured completely in surface micromechan-
ics (SMM) and, at the same time, the mag-
netic drive and control system is replaced 
by an electrostatic system, the decoupling 
of drive and measuring system does not 
need to be so thorough. Comb-like struc-
tures (Figs. 3 and 4) electrostatically force 
a centrally mounted rotary oscillator to os-
cillate. The amplitude of these oscillations 
is held constant by means of a similar ca-
pacitive pick-off. Coriolis forces result at

rotates about its vertical axis at yaw rate V, 
these register the Coriolis acceleration in 
the wafer plane vertical to the direction of 
oscillation (Figs. 1 and 2). These accelera-
tions are proportional to the product of 
yaw rate and the oscillation velocity which 
is maintained electronically at a constant 
value. 

To drive the sensor, all that is required is 
a simple, current-carrying conductor track 
on each oscillating element. In the perma-
nent-magnet field B vertical to the chip 
surface, this oscillating element is sub-
jected to an electrodynamic (Lorentz) 
force. Using a further, simple printed 
 conductor (which saves on chip surface), 
the same magnetic field is used to directly 
measure the oscillation velocity by induc-
tive means. The different physical con-
struction of drive system and sensor sys-
tem serves to avoid undesirable coupling 
between the two sections. In order to sup-
press unwanted external acceleration ef-
fects (common-mode signal), the opposing 
sensor signals are subtracted from each 
other. The external acceleration effects 
can be measured by applying summation. 
The high-precision micromechanical con-
struction helps to suppress the effects of 
high oscillatory acceleration which is sev-
eral factors of 10 higher than the low-level 
Coriolis acceleration (cross sensitivity far

the same time in an out-of-plane tilting 
movement, the amplitude of which is pro-
portional to the yaw rate V, and which is 
detected capacitively by the electrodes un-
derneath the oscillator. To avoid excessive 
damping of this movement, the sensor 
must be operated in a vacuum. Although 
the chip’s small size and the somewhat 
simpler production process result in con-
siderable cost reductions, this miniaturiza-
tion is at the expense of reductions in the 
measuring effect, which in any case is  
not very pronounced, and therefore of  
the achievable precision. It also places 
more severe demands on the electronics. 
The system’s high flexural stability, and 
mounting in the axis of gravity, serve to 
mechanically suppress the effects of un-
wanted external acceleration from the 
side.

DRS MM3x sensor cluster
A new generation of micromechanical ele-
ments are used in the DRS MM3x sensor 
cluster. These can measure and digitally 
process angular velocities and accelera-
tions. They create a modular concept for 
hardware and software based on circuit 
board technology with many new safety 
features which lead to a versatile and 
 reliable solution for many applications  
in the vehicle. 

Application
The ESP system, the connection to further 
chassis comfort systems and the develop-
ment of advanced driving stability systems 
called for inertia signals with high require-
ments, in particular in respect of signal 
quality and robustness, additional measur-
ing axes and high reliability. This is why 
Bosch has developed a third generation, 
the versatile yet inexpensive DRS MM3.x 
sensor cluster, to meet the requirements  
of functions such as hill hold control 
(HHC), automated parking brake (APB), 

navigation (Travel Pilot), adaptive cruise 
control (ACC), roll over mitigation (ROM), 
electronic active steering (EAS), active 
 suspension control (ASC), Steer-by-Wire.
DRS MM3.7k is the base variant of the 

MM3 generation for ESP applications.  
It comprises a yaw-rate sensor and an 
 integrated lateral acceleration module. 

Operating principle
The new micromechanical measuring ele-
ment for measuring yaw rate belongs to  
the familiar group of vibrating gyroscopes 
operating according to the Coriolis prin-
ciple (CVG = Coriolis Vibrating Gyros).  
It consists of an inverse tuning fork with  
two linear vibration modes perpendicular 
to one another, the drive circuit and the 
evaluator circuit. Drive and evaluation 
take place electrostatically in a comb-like 
structure. The Coriolis acceleration is 
measured electrostatically using elec-
trodes that extend into each other. The 
measuring element consists of two masses 
connected by a coupling spring. The reso-
nant frequency the same for the two vibra-
tion modes. It is typically around 15 kHz 
and is thus outside the usual interference 
spectrum in the vehicle and is hence resis-
tant to interfering vibration. The evalua-
tion circuit (ASIC) and the micromechani-
cal measuring element are contained in a 
prefabricated housing with 20 terminals 
(Premold 20).

The acceleration module is comparable  
in form with the yaw-rate sensor module 
and consists of a micromechanical mea-
suring element, an electronic evaluating 
circuit and a housing with 12 terminals 
(Premold12). The spring-mass structure is 
deflected in its sensitive axis by external 
accelerations and is evaluated by means  
of a differential capacitor in a comb-like 
form.

Sensor types  |  Piezoelectric “tuning-fork” yaw-rate sensor  |  323

Design
The piezoelectric "tuning fork" yaw-rate 
sensor comprises a steel element shaped 
like a tuning fork. This incorporates four 
piezo elements (two above, two below,  
Fig. 1) and the sensor electronics. The 
 tuning forks are about 15 mm long.

Operating principle
When voltage is applied, the bottom  
piezo elements start to oscillate and excite 
the upper section of the “tuning fork”, 
 together with its upper piezo elements, 
which then starts counter-phase oscillation. 
The frequency is approximately 2 kHz.

Straight-ahead driving
With the vehicle being driven in a straight 
line there are no Coriolis forces acting on 
the tuning fork, and since the upper piezo 
elements always oscillate in counter-phase 
and are only sensitive perpendicularly to 
the direction of oscillation, they do not 
generate a voltage.

Cornering
The rotational movement around the 
 vehicle’s vertical axis as it travels around  
a curve causes the upper portion of the 
tuning fork to leave the oscillatory plane 
so that an alternating voltage is generated 
in the upper piezo elements which is 
transferred to the navigation computer by 
an electronic circuit in the sensor housing. 
The voltage-signal amplitude is a function 
of both the yaw rate and the oscillation 
 velocity. Its sign depends on the direction 
(left or right) taken by the curve.

Piezoelectric “tuning-fork” 
yaw-rate sensor

Application
In order that it can use the digital road 
map stored on the CD-ROM to calculate 
the distance driven, the computer in the 
vehicle’s navigation system needs informa-
tion on the vehicle’s movements (compos-
ite navigation). 

When the vehicle is cornering, the navi-

gation system’s yaw-rate sensor records 
the vehicle’s rotation about its vertical 
axis, thus permitting determination of the 
direction of travel. The vehicle’s position 
can hence be calculated in conjunction 
with the determination of the distance 
traveled from the tachometer or wheel 
sensor signals by “composite positioning”. 
Initially in navigation systems, the vehi-

cle’s direction was determined from the 
earth’s magnetic field by a magnetic field 
sensor. However, these could easily be in-
fluenced by the magnetic interference in 
the vehicle. As oscillation gyroscopes are 
based on the measurement of mass forces, 
they are insensitive to magnetic interfer-
ence.

electrical resistance as a function of the 
mechanical stress resulting from the ap-
plied pressure (piezoresistive effect).

Micromechanical 
pressure sensors

Application
Pressure is a non-directional force acting 
in all directions which occurs in gases and 
liquids. Micromechanical pressure sensors 
detect the pressure of various media in the 
motor vehicle, e.g.: 
▶  Intake-manifold pressure, e.g. for load 
sensing in engine-management systems
▶  Boost pressure for boost-pressure con-

trol

▶  Ambient pressure for taking into ac-

count air density, e.g. in boost-pressure 
control

▶  Oil pressure to take engine load into 

 account in the service display

▶  Fuel pressure for monitoring the level 

of fuel-filter contamination

Micromechanical pressure sensors deter-
mine the absolute pressure of liquids and 
gases by measuring the pressure differen-
tial in relation to a reference vacuum. 

Version with the reference vacuum on 
the component side
Design
The measuring cell of a micromechanical 
pressure sensor consists of a silicon chip 
(Fig. 1a, Item 2), in which a thin diaphragm 
is micromechanically etched (1). Four 
strain-gage resistors (R1, R2), are diffused 
into the diaphragm. The electrical resis-
tance in these resistors changes in re-
sponse to mechanical elongation. The 
measuring cell is surrounded and sealed 
on its component side by a cap (Fig. 2,  
Item 6), which encloses the reference 
 vacuum underneath. 

A temperature sensor (Fig. 3, Item 1), 
the  signals of which can be evaluated inde-
pendently, can also be integrated in the 
pressure-sensor housing. 

Operating principle
The diaphragm of the sensor cell is de-
flected to varying degrees depending

of the voltages across them. This leads to  
a change in the measurement voltage UM. 
This as yet unamplified voltage is there-
fore a measure of the pressure applied  
to the diaphragm. 

The measurement voltage is higher  
with a bridge circuit than would be the 
case if an individual resistor were used. 
The Wheatstone bridge circuit thus per-
mits a higher sensor sensitivity.

The signal-conditioning electronic cir-
cuitry is integrated on the chip. Its func-
tion is to amplify the bridge voltage, com-
pensate for temperature influences, and 
linearize the pressure curve. The output 
voltage is in the range of 0 to 5 V and is 
 supplied via electrical connections to  
the engine control unit (Fig. 3, Item 5).  
The control unit uses this output voltage  
to calculate the pressure.

 contrast to the sensor with the reference 
vacuum on the component side, there is  
no passage in the glass base through which

High-pressure sensors

Application
High-pressure sensors are used in a motor 
vehicle to measure fuel pressure and 
brake-fluid pressure, e.g:
▶   Rail-pressure sensor for gasoline direct 

injection (pressure up to 200 bar)

▶  Rail-pressure sensor for common-rail 

diesel-injection system (pressure up to 
2,000 bar)

▶  Brake-fluid pressure sensor in the 

 hydraulic modulator of the electronic 
stability program (pressure up to  
350 bar)

Design and operating principle
High-pressure sensors operate according 
to the same principle as micromechanical 
pressure sensors. The core of the sensor is 
a steel diaphragm, onto which strain-gage 
resistors have been vapor-deposited in the 
form of a bridge circuit (Fig. 6, Item 3).  
The sensor’s measuring range is depen-
dent on the thickness of the diaphragm 
(thicker diaphragms for higher pressures, 
thinner diaphragms for lower pressures). 
As soon as the pressure to be measured  
is applied to one side of the diaphragm  
via the pressure connection (4), the strain-
gage resistors change their resistance 
 values as a result of the deflection of the 
diaphragm. The output voltage generated 
by the bridge  circuit is proportional to the 
applied  pressure. This voltage is transmit-
ted via connecting lines (bonding wires)  
to an evaluation circuit (2) in the sensor. 
The evaluation circuit amplifies the bridge 
signal to 0 to 5 V and transmits it to the 
control unit, which calculates the pressure 
with the aid of a characteristic curve.

applied to the silicon chip from the side on 
which the evaluation electronics is situated. 
This means that a special gel must be used 
on this side of the sensor to protect it against 
environmental influences. The reference 
vacuum (5) is enclosed in the cavity (special 
chamber) between the silicon chip and the 
glass base. The complete measuring element 
is mounted on a ceramic hybrid (4), which 
incorporates the soldering surfaces for 
 electrical contacting inside the sensor.

A temperature sensor can also be incor-
porated in the pressure-sensor housing.  
It protrudes into the air current, and can 
therefore respond to temperature changes 
with a minimum of delay (Fig. 4, Item 4).

Operating principle
The operating principle, and with it the signal 
conditioning and signal amplification to-
gether with the characteristic curve, corre-
spond to that used in the pressure sensor with 
cap and reference vacuum on the component 
side. The only difference is that the measuring 
element’s diaphragm is deformed in the op-
posite direction and therefore the strain-gage 
resistors are “bent” in the other direction.

Temperature sensors

Application
Engine-temperature sensor
This is installed in the coolant circuit 
(Fig. 1). The engine management uses  
its signal when calculating the engine 
 temperature (measuring range  
– 40 to +130 °C).

Air-temperature sensor
This sensor is installed in the air-intake 
tract. Together with the signal from the 
boost-pressure sensor, its signal is applied 
in calculating the intake-air mass. Apart 
from this, setpoint values for the various 
control loops (e.g. EGR, boost-pressure 
control) can be adapted to the air tempera-
ture (measuring range –40 to +120 °C).

Engine-oil temperature sensor
The signal from this sensor is used in cal-
culating the service interval (measuring 
range –40 to +170 °C).

Fuel-temperature sensor
Is incorporated in the low-pressure stage 
of the diesel fuel circuit. The fuel tempera-
ture is used in calculating precisely the 
 injected fuel quantity (measuring range  
–40 to +120 °C).

Exhaust-gas temperature sensor
This sensor is mounted on the exhaust-gas 
system at points which are particularly 
critical regarding temperature. It is ap-
plied in the closed-loop control of the 
 systems used for exhaust-gas treatment.  
A platinum measuring shunt is usually 
used (measuring range –40 to +1,000 °C).

Design and operating principle
Depending upon the particular application, 
a wide variety of temperature sensor types 
are available. A temperature-dependent 
semiconductor measuring shunt is fitted 
inside a housing. This resistor is usually  
of the NTC (Negative Temperature Coeffi-
cient, Fig. 2) type. Less often a PTC (Posi-
tive Temperature Coefficient) type is used. 
With NTC, there is a sharp drop in resis-
tance when the temperature rises, and  
with PTC there is a sharp increase.

The measuring shunt is part of a voltage-
divider circuit to which 5 V is applied.  
The voltage measured across the measur-
ing shunt is therefore temperature-depen-
dent. It is supplied through an analog-digi-
tal (A/D) converter and is a measure of the 
temperature at the sensor. A characteristic 
curve is stored in the control unit which 
 allocates a specific temperature to every 
resistance or output voltage value.

Accelerator-pedal sensors

In Motronic systems with electronic throt-
tle control (ETC), the accelerator-pedal 
sensor records the travel or the angular 
position of the accelerator pedal. For this 
purpose, potentiometers are used in addi-
tion to proximity-type sensors. The accel-
erator-pedal sensor is incorporated with 
the accelerator pedal in the accelerator-
pedal module. These ready-to-install units 
make adjustments on the vehicle a thing of

The engine control unit receives the mea-
sured value picked off at the potentiome-
ter wiper as a voltage. The control unit 
uses a stored sensor curve to convert this 
voltage into the relative pedal travel or the 
angular position of the accelerator pedal 
(Fig. 1).

A second (redundant) sensor is incorpo-

rated for diagnosis purposes and for use  
in case of malfunctions. It is a component 
part of the monitoring system. One sensor 
version operates with a second potentio-
meter, which always delivers half the volt-
age of the first potentiometer at all operat-
ing points. Thus, two independent signals 
are available for fault-detection purposes  
(Fig. 1). Instead of the second potentiome-
ter, another version uses a low-idle switch, 
which signals the idle position to the con-
trol unit. The status of this switch and the 
potentiometer voltage must be plausible.
For vehicles with automatic transmis-
sions, a further switch can be incorporated 
for an electrical kickdown signal. Alterna-
tively, this information can also be derived 
from the rate of change of the potentiome-
ter voltage. A further possibility is to trig-
ger the kickdown function by means of a 
defined voltage value of the sensor curve; 
here, the driver receives feedback on a jump 
in force in a mechanical kickdown cell.  
This is the most frequently used solution.

Hall angular-position sensors
Hall sensors are used to measure the move-
ment of the accelerator pedal on a non-con-
tact basis. In the case of the Type ARS1 Hall 
angular-position sensor, the magnetic flux of 
a roughly semicircular, permanent-magnetic 
disk is fed back via a pole shoe, two further 
conductive elements and the similarly 
 ferromagnetic shaft to the magnet (Fig. 2). 
 Depending upon the angular setting, the flux 
is led to a greater or lesser degree through 
the two conductive elements, in the mag-
netic path of which a Hall sensor is also situ-
ated. Using this principle, it is possible to 
achieve a practically linear characteristic 
curve in the measuring range of 90°.

The Type ARS2 is a simplified version 
which does without soft magnetic conduc-
tive elements (Fig. 3). In this version, the 
magnet moves around the Hall sensor in a 
circular arc. Only a relatively small section 
of the resulting sinusoidal characteristic 
curve features good linearity. If the Hall 
sensor is located slightly outside the cen-
ter of the circular arc, the characteristic 
curve increasingly deviates from the 
 sinusoidal, and now features a short mea-
suring range of almost 90°, and a longer 
measurement range of more than 180°  
with good linearity. A great disadvantage 
though is the low level of shielding against 
external fields, as well as the remaining 
dependence on the geometric tolerances 
of the magnetic circuit, and the intensity 
fluctuations of the magnetic flux in the 
permanent magnet as a function of tem-
perature and age.

In the case of the FPM2.3 type Hall 
 angular-position sensor, it is not the field 
strength but rather the direction of the 
magnetic field which is used to generate 
the output signal. The field lines are re-
corded by four radially arranged measur-
ing elements lying in one plane in the  
x- and y-directions (Fig. 4). The output sig-
nals are derived in the ASIC from the raw 
data (cos and sin signals) using the arctan 
function. The sensor is positioned between 
two magnets to generate a homogenous 

magnetic field. The sensor is therefore 
 insensitive to component tolerances and  
is temperature-resistant.

As with the accelerator-pedal module 
with a potentiometric sensor, these prox-
imity-type systems also contain two sen-
sors in order to receive two redundant 
voltage signals.

Steering-angle sensors

Application
The electronic stability program (ESP) 
 applies the brakes selectively to the indi-
vidual wheels in order to keep the vehicle 
on the desired track selected by the driver. 
Here, a control unit compares the steering 
angle and the applied brake pressure with 
the vehicle’s actual rotary motion (around 
its vertical axis) and its road speed. If nec-
essary, the brakes are applied at individual 
wheels. These measures serve to keep the 
float angle (deviation  between the vehicle 
axis and the actual  vehicle movement) 
down to a minimum and, until the physical 
limits are reached, prevent the vehicle 
breaking away.

Basically speaking, practically all types 

of angular-position sensors are suitable  
for registering the steering angle. Safety 
considerations, though, dictate that only 
those types are used which can be easily 
checked for plausibility, or which in the 
ideal case automatically check themselves. 
Potentiometer principles are used, as well 
as optical code-registration and magnetic 
principles. Whereas a passenger-car steer-
ing wheel turns through ±720° (a total of  
4 complete turns), conventional angular-
position sensors can only measure maxi-
mum 360°. This means that with the major-
ity of the sensors actually used for this 
purpose it is necessary to continually reg-
ister and store the data on the steering 
wheel’s actual setting.

Design and operating principle
Steering-angle sensor with AMR element 
The LWS3 steering-angle sensor uses AMR 
(Anisotropic Magnetoresistive Sensors) for 
its operation. The AMR’s electrical resis-
tance changes according to the direction  
of an external magnetic field. In the LWS3, 
the information on angle across a range  
of four complete rotations is provided by 
measuring the angles of two gear wheels 
which are rotated by a third gear wheel  
on the steering shaft. The first two gear 

wheels differ by one tooth which means 
that a definite pair of angular variables is 
associated with every possible steering-
wheel position.

By applying a mathematical algorithm  

(a computing process which follows a 
 defined step-by-step procedure) referred  
to here as a modified vernier principle, it 
is possible to use the above AMR method 
for calculating the steering angle in a mi-

These short connections enhance the 
 sensor’s robustness against external 
 interference.

The two GMR elements measure the 
direction of the field lines of the two mag-
nets. The steering angle is calculated from 
this in the microprocessor. The sensor 
element and microprocessor communicate 
via a digital interface (SPI interface).  
The calculated steering angle value is 
placed on the CAN by the microprocessor.
Because of the greater sensitivity, by 
comparison with the AMR effect, the LWS5 
can work with weaker magnets and greater 
air gaps. This brings considerable cost 
benefits in materials and design. The 360° 
angular measuring range of a single GMR 
element (a 180° measuring range is typical 
for AMR), allows the use of smaller gear 
wheels on the LWS5. It thus requires a sig-
nificantly smaller installation space than 
the LWS3. In addition, it has a significant 
level of scaleability, reflected in the mea-
suring range (±90° to ±780°) and in the de-
gree of redundancy. This means that the 
sensor can meet the specific requirements 
of the various vehicle manufacturers as 
closely as possible.

croprocessor. Here, even the measuring 
inaccuracy of the two AMR sensors can be 
compensated for. In addition, a self-check 
can also be implemented so that a highly 
plausible measured value can be sent to 
the control unit. 

Figure 1 shows the schematic represen-
tation of the LWS3 steering-angle sensor. 
The two gear wheels, with magnets inserted, 
can be seen. The sensors are located above 
them together with the evaluation elec-
tronics.

A different design is the LWS4 steering-
 angle sensor which unambiguously mea-
sures a steering angle of 180°. It is mounted 
on the shaft end of the steering axle (Fig. 3)

Steering-angle sensor with GMR element
The LWS5 is the first steering-angle sensor 
based on the GMR effect (Giant Magneto 
Resistive). Its mechanical structure and 
operating principle have been taken from 
the LWS3. The LWS3 and LWS5 are me-
chanically and electrically compatible.

The GMR layers are processed on the 
planarized surface of the evaluation circuit 
(vertical integration). The GMR resistor 
bridge and the evaluation module are con-
nected by means of plated-through holes.

be designed to be sufficiently robust as to 
be able to withstand the severe mechanical 
stresses over the service life of the vehicle. 
Surface-mounted sensors, on the other 
hand, are made in the standard packages 
familiar from engine compartment appli-
cations. They must meet the correspond-
ing requirements such as being splash-
proof and handling operating tempera-
tures from -40 to 130 °C. 

Because of the complex requirements 
(Table 1) arising from the various trans-
mission topologies, and the requirements 
on mounting space and function (safety 
concept, required precision, etc.) different 
physical measuring principles (Hall, AMR, 
GMR, eddy-current principles) and shapes 
(linear and rotary detection) may be used. 
These are explained in greater detail be-
low using the example of the Hall effect 
and the eddy current principle.

Linear position determination on the 
basis of Hall switches
Design
Four digital Hall switches are mounted on 
a printed-circuit board in such a way that 
they detect the magnetic orientation of a 
linearly displaceable, multipolar perma-
nent magnet (Fig. 1). The magnet carriage 
is coupled with the linearly actuated selec-
tor slide (hydraulic slide in the transmis-
sion control plate) or the parking lock 
 cylinder. 

In addition to the Hall switch, the 
printed-circuit board carries resistors  
to represent diagnosis functions and  
EMC  capacitors. 

The sensor electronics are protected 
against the influence of the transmission 
oil by being potted in a dense, oil-resistant 
epoxy resin.

Position sensors for 
 transmission control

Application
The position sensor detects the positions 
of an actuator (e.g. selector lever shaft, 
 selector slide or park lock cylinder) in  
AT, ASG, DKG and CVT transmissions.  
The sensors may be fitted stand-alone  
or built into electronics modules. 

Requirements
Sensors built into the transmission must 
be designed to cope with the challenging 
operating conditions prevailing there: 
 ▶ Ambient temperatures between -40 and 

+150 °C,

 ▶ Transmission oil, which is an aggressive 

ambient medium,

 ▶ High mechanical stress up to 30 g
 ▶ Abraded metallic materials and a build-

up of particles in the transmission. 

Resistance to the media and temperature 
in these applications is provided by an oil-
resistant enclosure for the electronics and 
the use of high temperature PCBs and AVT 
for the electronics. The electronic compo-
nents of ASIC, capacitors, resistors and 
 interfaces (bonds, soldering points) must

In some applications, the sensor transmits 
the controlled variable for starter release, 
the P/N signal, directly via a processor-
 independent hardware route. This in-
creases the availability in operating states 
(e.g. when the vehicle’s electrical system 
voltage is low) in which the electronic con-
trol unit would not yet be operational. 

In the case of automatic transmission 
with electronic shifting, also known as  
E-shifting, the position sensor detects  
only the positions of the park lock cylinder 
Pin and Pout and the intermediate range and 
passes these to the transmission control 
unit in the form of a 2-bit code.

Rotational position determination  
on the basis of eddy currents
Design
A position sensor with rotational design  
is shown in Figure 3. In this example, a 
specially shaped rotor with a return coil  
is mounted to rotate on the selector lever 
shaft outside the transmission. It repre-
sents the interface to the transmission 
 actuator. Redundant transmit and receive 
coils are mounted on the fixed sensor 
board with their associated evaluating 
ASICs. In this solution, the actuator (shaft) 
passes through the circuit board.

Operating principle
In the case of automatic transmission with 
manual shifting, also known as M-shifting, 
the position sensor detects the positions of 
the selector slide, P, R, N, D, 4, 3, 2 and the 
intermediate ranges and passes these to 
the transmission control in the form of a  
4-bit code (Fig. 2). For safety reasons, the 
position is encoded in one-step encoding, 
i.e. two-bit changes are always required 
before a new position is detected. Single-
bit changes caused by malfunctions can  
be detected as false by the control unit by 
plausibility considerations. The sequence 
of these bit changes corresponds to a  
Gray code.

Operating principle
The sensor uses the eddy-current princi-
ple. The transmitting coil induces in the 
return coil an eddy current opposite to its 
cause, the magnetic field of which induces 
a voltage in the receiver coils. The geome-
tries of the return coil and the receiver  
coil are tuned to one another, so that con-
tinuously changing positions of the rotor 
can be detected.

Similarly to the example of linear posi-
tion detection, the rotational position sen-
sor detects the P, R, N, D, 4, 3 and 2 posi-
tions. In this case, however, on the selector 
lever shaft projection out of the transmis-
sion. The positions of the shaft correspond 
to the positions of the selector slide inside 
the transmission. 

One benefit of analog signal condition-
ing is that the individual shift and interme-
diate ranges are assigned to the angle posi-
tions detected by the sensor in the software, 
and so can easily be adapted to transmis-
sion design variants.

3 Position sensor using eddy-current principles

For safety reasons, the sensor makes  
two independent, opposing output signals 
available, with the upper and lower 5 % 
of the signal stroke being used as a diag-
nostic range. In the event of a fault being 
detected inside the sensor, a voltage level 
in the upper diagnostic range is output. 
Faults that can occur on the transmission 
path to the control unit (e.g. open circuit 
or short-circuit) also lead to voltage levels 
in the diagnostics range. In addition to 
this, the electronic control unit tests the 
signal for plausibility by adding the two 
signals together. Sensor or transmission 
errors can be detected by the control unit 
in this way, and an appropriate emergency 
running program can be selected, depend-
ing on the fault.

Table 2 compares the two examples of 

position sensor and illustrates the com-
plexity of the topic. 

The complex requirements on the actua-

tor’s mechanical interface, the mounting 
space, the environmental influences and 
the safety concept frequently lead to appli-
cation-specific sensor system solutions.

Axle sensors

Applications 
The automatic headlamp range control 
(ALWR) adjusts the vehicle’s headlamp 
range automatically. With the headlamps 
on low beam, ALWR compensates for the 
vehicle tilt so that the driver has adequate 
vision without dazzling oncoming traffic. 
Whereas, the static ALWR compensates 
for the vehicle tilt resulting from the vehi-
cle loading, the dynamic version also takes 
into account the front-end up and down 
pitching movement of the vehicle caused 
by braking and acceleration. Here, the axle 
sensors precisely register the bodywork’s 
tilt angle. 

Design and operating principle
Axle sensors (angular-position sensors) 
are used to measure the vehicle tilt. These 
are attached to the bodywork at the front 
and rear of the vehicle. Spring compres-
sion is transmitted to the sensors by a 
pivot lever which is connected through  
a connecting rod to the particular axle  
or to the wheel suspension. The vehicle’s 
tilt is then calculated from the difference 
between the voltages of the front and rear 
axle sensors. 

The axle sensors function according  
to the Hall effect. A Hall IC is built into the 
stator (Fig. 1, Item 5) where it is located in 

a  homogenous magnetic field. The mag-
netic field generates a Hall voltage in the 
Hall IC proportional to the magnetic-field 
strength. When the ring magnet (6) is ro-
tated by the shaft (2), the magnetic field 
through the Hall IC changes accordingly. 
When the springs are compressed due 
to loading and/or acceleration/braking,  
the connecting rod (Fig. 2, Item 4) trans-
fers the spring compression movement to 
the pivot lever of the axle sensor so that it 
is converted into a voltage signal which is 
proportional to the angle of rotation.

The control unit registers the axle-sen-
sor signals and from them generates the 
difference between front and rear axle. 
 Using this voltage difference, and taking 
into account the vehicle’s speed, the con-
trol unit now calculates the setpoint value 
for the servomotor settings. With the vehi-
cle driving at constant speed, the dynamic 
ALWR remains in the status which features 
a high level of damping whereby the step-
ping motors are adapted slowly to the 
 vehicle tilt. This prevents bumps, uneven-
ness, or holes in the road causing continu-
ous correction of the headlamp settings. 
When the vehicle accelerates, or the 
brakes are applied, the system automati-
cally switches to the dynamic mode, and 
adjusts the headlamp range within a few 
milliseconds. The system then switches 
back to the slower mode.

Hot-film air-mass meters 

Application
To provide precise pilot control of the  
air-fuel ratio, it is essential for the supplied 
air mass to be exactly determined in the 
respective operating status. The hot-film 
air-mass meter measures some of the actu-
ally inducted air-mass flow for this pur-
pose. It takes into account the pulsations 
and reverse flows caused by the opening 
and closing of the engine’s intake and ex-
haust valves. Intake-air temperature or 
air-pressure changes have no effect upon 
measuring accuracy.

HFM5 design
The housing of the HFM5 hot-film air-mass 
meter (Fig. 1, Item 5) projects into a mea-
suring tube (Fig. 3, Item 6) which, depend-
ing upon the engine’s air-mass require-
ments (370 to 970 kg/h) can have a variety 
of diameters. The measuring tube normally

contains a flow rectifier, which ensures that 
the flow in the measuring tube is uniform. 
The flow rectifier is either a combination  
of a plastic mesh with straightening action 
and a wire mesh, or is a wire mesh on its own 
(Fig. 3, Item 8).The measuring tube is in-
stalled in the intake tract downstream from 
the air filter. Plug-in versions are also avail-
able which are installed inside the air filter.

The most important component parts in the 
sensor are the measuring cell (Fig. 1, Item 4) 
in the air intake (8) and the integrated evalu-
ation electronics (3). 

The sensor measuring cell consists of  
a semiconductor substrate. The sensitive 
surface is formed by a diaphragm which 
has been manufactured in micromechani-
cal processes. This diaphragm incorpo-
rates temperature-sensitive resistors.  
The elements of the evaluation electronics 
(hybrid circuit) are installed on a ceramic 
substrate. This principle permits very 
compact design. The evaluation electron-
ics are connected to the control unit by 
means of electrical connections (1). 

The partial-flow measuring passage (6) 

is shaped so that the air flows past the 
measuring cell smoothly (without swirl 
 effects) and back into the measuring tube 
via the air outlet (7). The length and loca-
tion of the inlet and outlet of the partial-
flow measuring passage have been chosen 
to provide good sensor performance even 
in the event of sharply pulsating flows. 

Operating principle
The HFM5 hot-film air-mass meter is a thermal 
sensor which operates according to the fol-
lowing principle: A centrally situated heat-
ing resistor on the measuring cell (Fig. 3,

resistor so as to be symmetrical to it  
(measuring points M1, M2). Without the 
flow of incoming air, the temperature 
 profile (1) is the same on each side of  
the heating zone (T1 = T2). 

As soon as air flows over the measuring 

cell, the uniform temperature profile at  
the diaphragm changes (2). On the inlet 
side, the temperature characteristic is 
steeper since the incoming air flowing  
past this area cools it off. On the opposite 
side, the temperature characteristic only 
changes slightly, because the incoming air 
flowing past has been heated by the heater 
element. The change in temperature distri-
bution leads to a temperature difference 
(∆T) between the measuring points M1 
and M2.

The heat dissipated to the air, and there-
fore the temperature characteristic at the 
measuring cell is dependent on the air mass 
flowing past. The temperature difference is 
(irrespective of the absolute temperature of 
the air flow past) a measure of the air-flow 
mass. It is also direction-dependent so that 
the air-mass meter can record both the 
amount and the direction of an air-mass 
flow.

Due to its very thin micromechanical 
 diaphragm, the sensor has a highly dy-
namic response (< 15 ms), a point which  
is of particular importance when the in-
coming air is pulsating heavily.

The evaluation electronics integrated in 
the sensor convert the resistance differen-
tial at the measuring points M1 and M2 into 
an analog voltage signal of between 0 and  
5 V. Using the sensor curve (Fig. 2) stored in 
the engine control unit, the measured volt-
age is converted into a value representing 
the air-mass flow (kg/h). 

The shape of the characteristic curve is 
such that the diagnosis facility incorporated 
in the control unit can detect such malfunc-
tions as an open-circuit line. An additional 
temperature sensor for evaluation functions 
can be integrated in the HFM5 hot-film air-
mass meter. It is not required for measuring 
the air mass.

developed which, in conjunction with a 
 deflector mesh, keeps dirty water and dust 
away from the sensor element (HFM5-CI; 
with C-shaped bypass and inner tube (I), 
which together with the deflector mesh 
protects the sensor). 

HFM6 hot-film air-mass meter
The HFM6 uses the same sensor element 
as the HFM5 and has the same basic 
 design. It differs in two crucial points:
▶  The integrated evaluation electronics 
operate digitally in order to obtain 
greater measuring accuracy

▶  The design of the partial-flow measuring 
passage is altered to provide protection 
against contamination directly upstream 
of the sensor element (similar to the de-
flector mesh in the HFM5-CI)

Digital electronics
A voltage signal is generated with a bridge 
circuit from the resistance values at the 
measuring points M1 and M2 (Fig. 3); this 
voltage signal serves as the measure of the 
air mass. The signal is converted into digi-
tal form for further processing. 

The HFM6 also takes into account the 
temperature of the intake air when deter-
mining the air mass. This increases signifi-
cantly the accuracy of the air-mass mea-
surement.

The intake-air temperature is measured  
by a temperature-dependent resistor, 
which is integrated in the closed control 
loop for monitoring the heating-zone tem-
perature. The voltage drop at this resistor 
passes through an analog-digital converter 
to give a digital signal representing the in-
take-air temperature. The signals for air 
mass and intake-air temperature are used 
to address a program map in which the 
correction values for the air-mass signal 
are stored. 

Improved protection against  
contamination
The partial-flow measuring passage is di-
vided into two sections in order to provide 
better protection against contamination 
(Fig. 4). The passage which passes the sen-
sor element has a sharp edge (1), around 
which air must flow. Heavy particulates 
and dirty-water droplets are unable to fol-
low this diversion and are separated from 
the partial flow. These contaminants exit 
the sensor through a second passage (5). 
In this way, significantly fewer dirt parti-
cles and droplets reach the sensor ele- 
ment (3) with the result that contamina- 
tion is reduced and the service life of the 
air-mass meter is significantly prolonged 
even when operated with contaminated 
air.

Mounting
In four-cylinder engines, one knock sensor 
is sufficient to record the knock signals for 
all the cylinders. Engines with more cylin-
ders require two or more knock sensors. 
The knock-sensor installation point on  
the engine is selected so that knock can  
be reliably detected from each cylinder. 
The sensor is usually bolted to the side  
of the engine block. It must be possible  
for the generated signals (structure-borne-
noise vibrations) to be introduced without 
resonance into the knock sensor from  
the measuring point on the engine block.  
A fixed bolted connection satisfying the 
following requirements is required for  
this purpose:
▶  The mounting bolts must be tightened to 

a defined torque 

▶  The contact surface and the bore in the 

engine block must comply with prespec-
ified quality requirements

▶  No washers of any type may be used

Application
Regarding their principle of functioning, 
knock sensors are basically vibration sen-
sors and are suitable for detecting struc-
ture-borne acoustic oscillations. These 
 occur as “knock”, for instance, in gasoline 
engines when uncontrolled combustion 
takes place. They are converted by the 
knock sensor into electrical signals (Fig. 1) 
and transmitted to the Motronic control 
unit, which counteracts the engine knock 
by adjusting the ignition angle.

Design and operating principle
Due to its inertia, a mass (Fig. 2, Item 2) 
 excited by a given oscillation or vibration 
exerts a compressive force on a toroidal 
piezoceramic element (1) at the same 
 frequency as the excitation oscillation. 
These forces effect a charge transfer 
within the ceramic element. An electrical 
voltage is generated between the top and 
bottom of the ceramic element which is 
picked off via contact washers (5) and 
 processed in the Motronic control unit.

340  |  Sensor types  |  SMM acceleration sensors

SMM acceleration sensors

Application
Surface micromechanical (SMM) accelera-
tion sensors have a variety of acceleration 
detection roles in the vehicle. These in-
clude the detection of acceleration values 
for a frontal or lateral impact in order to 
trigger the seat-belt pretensioners, the air-
bag and the rollover bar in vehicle occu-
pant-protection systems. Surface micro-
mechanical (SMM) acceleration sensors 
are used in the field of active vehicle safety 
in ABS, ESP and HHC (Hill Hold Control, 
low-speed traction control) systems. Fur-
ther possible applications of acceleration 
sensors are found in chassis and suspen-
sion control (active suspension) and vehi-
cle alarm systems, where a change in the 
 vehicle tilt will trigger an alarm.

Design and operating principle
The surface micromechanical sensor ele-
ments are designed for different measur-
ing ranges, depending on the application. 
These measuring ranges lie between 1 g 
and 400 g (1 g ≈ 9.81 m/s2). The design of 
an acceleration sensor for side or frontal 
impact sensing is described below. The 
SMM sensor element is fitted together with 
the evaluation electronics (ASIC) in a first 

packaging stage (module). Figure 1 shows 
a module in a SO16 housing. This module 
on a small PCB, with further circuit com-
ponents, is pressed into the second pack-
aging stage, a plastic housing. This housing 
is closed and sealed with a welded plastic 
lid. This sensor is intended for installation 
in the side or fender of the vehicle after 
calibration and testing and sends its accel-
eration signal via plug and cable to the 
central airbag control unit. 

The functional layers of the sensor ele-
ment representing a spring-mass system 
are applied to the surface of the silicon 
 wafer by an additive method (Fig. 3, 
 surface micromechanics).

The mass with its comb-like electrodes 

(Figs. 2 and 3, Item 1) is connected via 
spring elements (2) to the anchor points 
(Fig. 3, Item 4) in the core of the sensor. 
There are fixed comb-like electrodes (3, 6) 
on the chip on each side of these movable 
electrodes. A useful capacitance in the 
range of 300 fF to 1 pF results from the 
connection in parallel of the individual 
 capacitances formed by the fixed and 
 moving electrode fingers. The two rows  
of electrode fingers connected in parallel 
result in two useful capacitances (C1 – CM 
and C2 – CM), which change in opposite di-
rections as the central mass is deflected.

The acceleration applied to the spring-
mass system deflects it by an amount lin-
early  related to the acceleration applied 
over the spring return force. An electrical 
 output signal that is linearly dependent on 
the acceleration is obtained by evaluation 
of this differential capacitor.

The acceleration signal obtained in  
the first stage of the evaluation circuit is 
further conditioned in the ASIC, i.e. it is 
amplified, filtered and prepared for the 
output interface.

Analog voltages, pulse-width-modulated 

signals, SPI protocols or current loop in-
terfaces are usual as the output interface. 
Tolerances arising from the manufacture 
of the sensor element, the evaluation cir-
cuit and package influences on sensitivity 
and zero point are eliminated by means of 
a comparison of programmable memory 
cells at the end of the production line.  
A self-test function tests the full mechani-
cal and electrical signal path. In the course 
of this self-diagnosis, an electrostatic force 
deflects the sensor structure, i.e. simulat-
ing an acceleration in the vehicle, and the 
response of the measurement signal is 
compared with a setpoint value. 

Up to three acceleration sensors (for ESP 
and HHC) and one or two yaw-rate sen-
sors (for ESP) are incorporated in the ESP 
sensor cluster. This clustering of sensor 
modules reduces the number of individual 
components and signal lines by compari-
son with separate sensor devices. It also 
means that fewer mountings and less in-
stallation space are needed in the vehicle.

This configuration corresponds to a series 
circuit of two capacitors C1–M and C2–M. 
 Alternating voltages are applied across 
terminals C1 and C2, and their superimpo-
sitions picked off between the capacitors 
at CM. 

In the idle condition, the capacitances 
C1–M and C2–M are ideally equal. This means 
that the difference DC is equal to zero. 
If an acceleration a is acting in the measur-
ing direction, the Si center plate (the seis-
mic mass) is caused to deflect. This causes 
a change in the distance to the upper and 
lower plates, and with it a capacitance 
change in the capacitors C1–M and C2–M 
and thus a difference DC not equal to zero. 
This leads to a change in the electrical sig-
nal at CM which is amplified and filtered in 
the evaluation electronics.

The air space between the plates allows 

effective damping with low temperature 
sensitivity.

Micromechanical bulk silicon 
acceleration sensors

Application
Micromechanical bulk silicon acceleration 
sensors detect the acceleration signals 
needed for ABS, ESP and shock absorber 
adjustment. 

This type of sensor is today predomi-
nantly used in the low acceleration ranges 
with high demands on signal to noise ratio 
(< 2 gn).

Design and operating principle
Anisotropic and selective etching tech-
niques are used to form the required 
spring-mass system for the sensor from 
the solid wafer (bulk or volume microme-
chanics). Capacitive pick-offs have proven 
especially effective for the high-precision 
measurement of this seismic-mass deflec-
tion. They require a wafer-thick silicon or 
glass plate (Fig. 1, Item 4) with counter-
electrodes, on each side of the spring-held 
mass (2). The wafers and their counter-
electrodes here also provide overload 
 protection.

Piezoelectric acceleration 
sensors

Application
Piezoelectric spring elements are used  
as acceleration sensors in passenger-
 restraint systems for triggering the seat-
belt pretensioners, the airbags, and the 
rollover bar. 

Design and operating principle
The core of this acceleration sensor is a 
spring element (bending beam). A bonded 
structure comprising two piezoelectric 
layers of opposing polarity (bimorphous 
spring element). An acceleration acting  
on this element generates a mechanical 
tensile stress in one layer and a compres-
sive stress in the second layer (Fig. 1).

The metallized surfaces on the top and 

underneath of the spring element act  
as electrodes from which the resultant 
voltage is picked off. This structure is 
packaged together with the electronics 
 required in a hermetically sealed housing 
(Fig. 2).

The electronic circuit consists of an im-
pedance converter and a tunable amplifier 
with predefined filter characteristics.  
The design means that no static signals

iBolt™ force sensor

Applications
NHTSA FMVSS-208 (National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration; Federal 
 Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and 
 Regulations 208) came into force in the 
USA in 2004. These regulations were intro-
duced to prevent or reduce injuries to 
 children traveling in the front passenger 
seat caused by the airbag triggering. Clas-
sifying the front passenger by means of a 
weight measurement makes it possible to 
switch the airbag off selectively if a small 
child is occupying the seat. 

The BOSCH iBolt™ (intelligent bolt) 
 sensor was developed to perform this 
weight classification reliably and robustly. 
This is done by fitting four iBolts™ in the 
seat frame of the front-passenger seat  
(a sensor in each corner of the seat, Fig. 1). 
A control unit also built into the seat analy-
ses the four analog, electrical weight sig-

1  Fitting four iBolts™ in the seat base frame of the 

front passenger’s seat

nals and transmits the result of the classifi-
cation to the airbag control unit. 

Design and operating principle
The iBolt™ sensor’s operating principle  
is based on the measurement of the deflec-
tion of a bending beam caused by the pas-
senger’s weight. The amount of the deflec-
tion is detected by measurement of the 
magnetic field strength in a special Hall 
sensor/magnet configuration (Fig. 2a). 

The iBolt™ is designed such that it is the 
z component of the passenger’s weight that 
causes the deflection of the bending beam. 
The vehicle’s co-oordinates system here 
defines the x axis as the direction of travel, 
the z and y axes being perpendicular and 
horizontal to this. The configuration of the 
magnet and the Hall IC in the sensor is se-
lected such that the static magnetic field 
which penetrates the Hall IC results in an 
electrical signal linear to the deflection  
of the bending beam. The special design  
of the iBolt™ sensor prevents a horizontal 
deflection of the Hall IC in relation to the 
magnet, to minimize the influence of trans-
verse forces and moments. In addition,  
the maximum stress in the bending beam 
is limited by a mechanical overload  
stop (Fig. 2b). This protects the iBolt™, 
 especially in the event of overloads in a 
crash.

Calibration
The linear Hall sensor uses the spinning 
current measuring principle which allows 
calibration of the sensitivity, the offset and 
the temperature sensitivity of measure-
ment. The calibration data is stored in an 
EEPROM incorporated in the substrate  
for the Hall sensor.

Linearity of the output signal
A linear output signal has been achieved 
by means of a special design feature.  
The force generated by the weight of the 
front passenger is passed from the upper 
seat structure through the sleeve into the 
bending beam (Fig. 2a). The force is then

generated by the seat occupant’s position, 
which also depends on the position of the 
seat back. For this reason, the measuring 
range of the iBolt™ sensor has been de-
signed such that the forces can be detected 
in both the positive and negative z direc-
tions. This permits an unambiguous deter-
mination of the front passenger’s weight. 
Thanks to its symmetrical measuring 
range, the iBolt™ sensor detects compres-
sion and tensile forces with the same sen-
sitivity and the same tolerances. This means 
that the same sensors can be used in both 
vertical mounting orientations for all four 
points of connection between the upper 
and lower seat structures. 

passed from the bending beam into the 
lower seat structure. The bending beam 
was designed as a double bending beam  
as this has an S-shaped deformation line. 
The two vertical connection points of the 
double bending beam remain vertical over 
the entire deflection range. This guaran-
tees a linear and parallel movement of the 
Hall IC in  relation to the magnet, resulting 
in a linear output signal (Fig. 3).

Symmetrical measuring range
Tests of the system in vehicle seats have 
shown that both positive and negative 
forces can act on the sensors. This has a 
number of causes: on the one hand, nega-
tive forces can act on an individual tension 
as a result of initial tensions as a conse-
quence of tolerances in the assembly of 
the seat and of its installation in the vehi-
cle. On the other hand, negative forces 
arise on individual sensors as a function  
of the distribution of forces on the sensors

346  |  Sensor types  |  Torque sensor

Torque sensor 

Application
Electromechanical power-assisted steering 
is increasingly being introduced in small, 
compact and medium class vehicles.  
The essential advantages are simple instal-
lation and commissioning in the vehicle, 
energy saving and the suitability of these 
systems in the vehicle’s network of control 
units for assistance systems enhancing 
comfort and safety.

Design and operating principle
In order to sense the driver command in 
electromechanical power-assisted steer-
ing, it is necessary to measure the torque 
applied by the driver. In the sensor cur-
rently in series production use for this, a 
torsion rod is fitted in the steering shaft. 
The rod is twisted by a defined amount in 
linear proportion to the torque applied  
by the driver when the driver turns the 
steering wheel (Fig. 1). This twisting can, 
for its part, be measured by suitable means 
and converted into electrical signals.  
The measuring range required for a torque 
 sensor to be used in electromechanical 
power-assisted steering is usually around 
± 8 to ± 10 Nm. The maximum angle of ro-
tation is mechanically limited by special 
components to protect the torsion rod 
against overload or destruction.

A magnetoresistive sensor is mounted 

on one side of the torsion rod to allow 
measurement of the twisting and hence  
the torque applied. This scans the field of  
a magnetic multipole wheel mounted on 
the other side. The number of poles se-
lected for this wheel is such that the sen-
sor issues an unambiguous signal within 
its maximum measuring range and thus 
makes a clear statement of the torque 
 applied at any time.

Here the magnetoresitive sensor use sup-
plies two signals over the measuring range 
which describe a sine and a cosine signal 
plotted against the angle of rotation of the 
torsion rod. The angle of rotation and 
hence of the torque is calculated in  
an electronic control unit using an arc- 
tangent function.

As there is always a fixed assignment of 
the two signals over the defined measuring 
range, a deviation from this allows faults in 
the sensor to be detected and the neces-
sary substitution measures to be intro-
duced.

A coil spring with the necessary number 
of contacts is used to provide the electrical 
contacts for the sensor over the rotational 
range of approximately ± 2 revolutions of 
the steering wheel. The power is supplied 
and the measured values are transmitted 
via this coil spring.

Design and operating principle
A rain sensor comprises an optical trans-
mission and reception path (Fig. 1). An 
LED (6) emits light at a determined angle 
into the windshield (2) which is reflected 
on the outer boundary layer (glass/play) 
(total reflection) and then is evaluated  
on an aligned receiver (photodiode, 4).  
If there is moisture on the sensitive outer 
surface, a part of the light is coupled out as 
a function of the droplet size and number, 
which attenuates the return signal. 

The integrated light sensor generally 
comprises two or three photodiodes (3, 5) 
which receive and evaluate the light com-
ing from various directions. Depending  
on the function of the light sensor, diodes 
are used that reflect the receptiveness of 
the human eye (silicon eyes) or have their 
maximum sensitivity rather in the near 
 infrared range. 

Complex filter functions and trigger 
strategies are stored in the rain/light sen-
sor. The status information derived from 
this (e.g. wiper speed 1, intermittent wiper, 
intermittent timing, lights on, lights off) 
are made available to other control units 
via a data bus (e.g. CAN, LIN).

Rain/light sensor

Application of the rain sensor
The rain sensor detects fine raindrops  
on the windshield, so that the windshield 
wipers can be triggered automatically.  
The sensor controls the speed of the wiper 
system according to the amount of rain 
measured on the windshield (intermittent, 
speed 1 and speed 2). Together with the 
electronically controlled wiper drive, 
 intermittent operation can be varied 
 infinitely. For instance, when masses of 
rain water flood the windshield when 
overtaking, the wiper is automatically 
switched to the highest wiper speed. 
 Various activation strategies are available: 
 ▶ Permanently active
 ▶ Activated via steering column switch 
 ▶ Activation after steering column switch 

movement (transients)

This assistance function frees the driver 
from the other control operations used on 
conventional wiper systems. Nevertheless, 
manual control is retained as an additional 
intervention.

The rain sensor can also be used for 
other functions such as closing the win-
dows and the sliding sunroof. 

Application of the light sensor
A light sensor is also incorporated in the 
rain sensor, it may be used to control the 
low beam. This can detect the various situ-
ations (e.g. twilight, driving into and out of 
a tunnel, driving under long bridges) and 
switch the low beam on or off  accordingly. 
The light sensor can also be used to con-
trol all the lighting functions on the vehi-
cle. These functions include  adjusting the 
brightness of the instrument cluster light-
ing, “coming home leaving home” or selec-
tively switching on the rear lamps.

348  |  Sensor types  |  Two-step Lambda oxygen sensors

Two-step Lambda oxygen 
sensors

Application
These sensors are used in gasoline engines 
equipped with two-step Lambda oxygen 
sensor. They extend into the exhaust pipe 
between the engine’s exhaust manifold and 
the catalytic converter, and record the 
 exhaust-gas flow leaving each cylinder. 
Thanks to the Lambda oxygen sensor be-
ing heated, it can be installed further away 
from the engine so that long periods of 
full-load  engine operation are unproblem-
atical. The LSF4 sensor is also suitable for 
operation with exhaust-gas control systems 
featuring a number of sensors (for instance 
with OBDII).

Two-step Lambda oxygen sensors com-

pare the residual-oxygen content in the 
exhaust gas with the oxygen content in the 
reference atmosphere (surrounding air 
 inside the sensor) and indicate whether a 
rich (l < 1) or lean air-fuel mixture (l > 1) 
is present in the exhaust gas. The sudden 
jump in the characteristic curve of these 
sensors permits air-fuel control of l = 1 
(Fig. 1).

Operating principle
The two-step Lambda oxygen sensors op-
erate in accordance with the principle of 
the  galvanic oxygen-concentration cell 
with solid-state electrolyte (Nernst princi-
ple). The ceramic element is conductive 
for  oxygen ions from a temperature of ap-
proximately 350 °C (safe, reliable opera-
tion at >350 °C). Due to the abrupt change 
in the residual-oxygen content on the ex-
haust-gas side in the range of l = 1 (e.g. 
9 · 10–15 % vol. for l = 0.99 and 0.2 % vol. 
for l = 1.01), the different oxygen content 
on both sides of the sensor generates an 
electrical voltage between the two bound-
ary layers. This means that the oxygen 
content in the exhaust gas can be used as  
a measure of the air-fuel ratio. The inte-
grated heater  ensures that the sensor 

functions even at extremely low exhaust-
gas temperatures.

The sensor’s output voltage US is a func-

tion of the oxygen content in the exhaust 
gas. In the case of a rich air-fuel mixture 
(l,1) it reaches 800 to 1,000 mV. For a 
lean mixture (l.1), only approximately 
100 mV are generated. The transition from 
the rich to the lean area at Ureg is at about 
450 to 500 mV. 

The temperature of the ceramic element 
influences its ability to conduct the oxygen 
ions, and thus the shape of the output-volt-
age curve as a function of the excess-air 
factor l (the values in Figure 1 are there-
fore temperature-dependent). In addition, 
the response time for a voltage change 
when the mixture composition changes is 
also strongly dependent on temperature.

Whereas response times at ceramic tem-
peratures below 350 °C are in the seconds 
range, at optimum temperatures of around 
600 °C the sensor responds in less than 
50 ms. When the engine is started there-
fore, the Lambda control is switched off 
 until the minimum operating temperature 
of about 350 °C is reached. During this pe-
riod, the engine is open-loop-controlled.

Design
LSH25 finger-type sensor
Sensor ceramic element with protective tube
The solid electrolyte is a ceramic element 
which is impermeable to gas. It is a mixed 
oxide comprising the elements zirconium 
and yttrium in the form of a tube closed at 
one end (finger, Fig. 3). The surfaces have 
been provided on both sides with elec-
trodes made from a microporous, thin 
 noble-metal layer. 

The ceramic body protrudes into the 
 exhaust pipe, and the platinum electrode  
on its outside surface acts as a catalytic 
converter in miniature. Exhaust gas which 
reaches this electrode is processed cata-
lytically and brought to a stoichiometrical 
balance (l = 1). In addition, the side that is 
exposed to the exhaust gas has a porous, 
ceramic multiple layer (spinel layer) to 
protect it against contamination and

 erosive damage. The ceramic element is 
also protected against mechanical impact 
and thermal shocks by a metal tube. A 
number of slots in the protective tube are 
specially shaped so that on the one hand 
they are particularly effective against ex-
tensive thermal and chemical stresses, 
while on the other hand preventing a 
sharp drop in sensor-ceramic temperature 
when the exhaust gas is “cool”.

The sensor’s “open” inner chamber is 
connected to the surrounding air, which 
acts as a reference gas (Fig. 3). 

Sensor element with heater element and 
electrical connection
A ceramic support tube (Fig. 2, Item 2)  
and a disk spring (10) serve to locate, fix, 
and seal-off the active, finger-shaped sen-
sor ceramic in the sensor housing. A con-
tact element (6) between the support tube  
and the active sensor ceramic element 
provides the contact between the inner 
 electrode and the connection cable. 

The outer electrode is connected to the 
sensor housing by the metal sealing ring. 

The sensor’s complete internal structure is 
located and held in place by a protective 
metal sleeve (7) which at the same time 
acts as the support for the disk spring.  
The protective sleeve also guards against 
contamination of the sensor’s interior.  
The connecting cable is crimped to the 
contact element which protrudes from the 
sensor, and is protected against moisture 
and mechanical damage by a temperature-
resistant cap.

The tube-type (finger) Lambda oxygen 
sensor is also equipped with an electrical 
heater element. This ensures that the ce-
ramic-element temperature remains suffi-
ciently high, even at low engine load and 
thus low exhaust-gas temperature.

This external heating is so quick that  
the sensor reaches operating temperature 
20 to 30 s after the engine has started and 
therefore Lambda control can come into 
operation. Finally, sensor heating provides 
for an optimal ceramic-element operating 
temperature above the operating limit of 
350 °C and thus ensures low and stable 
 exhaust-gas emissions.

It is integrated and insulated in the ce-
ramic wafer and ensures that the sensor 
heats up quickly even in the event of low 
power input.

The reference-air channel inside the  
LSF4 Lambda oxygen sensor – operating  
as a reference-gas sensor (Figs. 5 and 6) – 
has access to the ambient air. This enables 
it to compare the residual oxygen content 
of the exhaust gas with the oxygen content 
of the reference gas. In other words, with 
the air inside the sensor. This means that 
the sensor voltage also features a charac-
teristic jump in the case of the planar sen-
sor, in the area of stoichiometric air-fuel 
mixture (l = 1) (Fig. 1).

LSF4 planar Lambda oxygen sensor
Regarding their function, planar Lambda 
oxygen sensors correspond to the heated 
finger sensors with their voltage-jump 
curve at l = 1. On the planar sensor 
though, the solid-state electrolyte is 
 comprised of a number of individual 
 laminated foils stacked one on top of the 
other (Fig. 4). The sensor is protected 
against thermal and mechanical influ- 
ences by a double-walled protective tube.
The planar ceramic element (measuring 

cell and heater are integrated) is shaped 
like a long stretched-out wafer with rect-
angular cross-section. 

The surfaces of the measuring cell are 
provided with a microporous noble-metal 
layer, which also has a porous ceramic 
layer on the exhaust-gas side to protect  
it against the erosive effects of the ex-
haust-residues. The heater is a wave-
shaped element containing noble metal.

LSU4 planar wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor

Application
As its name implies, the wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor is used across a 
very extensive range to determine the 
 oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas. 
The figures provided by the sensor are an 
indication of the air-fuel ratio in the com-
bustion chamber. The excess-air factor l 
is used when defining the air-fuel ratio.

The sensor projects into the exhaust pipe 
and registers the exhaust-gas mass flow 
from all cylinders. Wide-band Lambda ox-
ygen sensors make precise measurements 
not only at the stoichiometric point l = 1, 
but also in the lean range (l>1) and in the 
rich range (l<1). In combination with con-
trol electronics, these sensors generate an 
unmistakable, continuous electrical signal 
in the range from 0.7 < l < ` (air with 21 % 
O2) (Fig. 3). This means that the wide-band 
Lambda oxygen sensor can be used not 
only in engine-management systems with 
two-step control (l=1), but also in control 
concepts with rich and lean air-fuel mix-
tures. This type of Lambda oxygen sensor 
is therefore also suitable for Lambda con-
trol with lean-burn concepts on gasoline 
engines, as well as for diesel engines, gas-

powered engines and gas-powered central 
heaters and water heaters (hence the Ger-
man designation LSU: Lambda-Sonde-Uni-
versal = universal Lambda oxygen sensor).
In a number of systems, several Lambda 

oxygen sensors are installed for even 
greater accuracy. Here, for instance, they 
are fitted upstream and downstream of the 
catalytic converter as well as in the indi-
vidual exhaust tracts (cylinder banks).

Design
The LSU4 wide-band Lambda oxygen sen-
sor (Fig. 2) is a planar dual-cell current-
limit sensor. It features a measuring cell 
(Fig. 1) made of zirconium-dioxide ceramic 
(ZrO2), and is a combination of a Nernst 
concentration cell (sensor cell which func-
tions in the same way as a two-step Lambda 
oxygen sensor) and an oxygen pump cell 
for transporting the oxygen ions. The oxy-
gen-pump cell (Fig. 1, Item 8) is so ar-
ranged with respect to the Nernst concen-
tration cell (7) that there is a 10 to 50 µm 
diffusion gap (6) between them. Here, there 
are two porous platinum  electrodes: one 
pump electrode and one Nernst measuring 
electrode. The diffusion gap is connected 
to the exhaust gas by way of a gas-access 
passage (10). A porous diffusion barrier 
(11) serves to limit the flow of oxygen mol-
ecules from the exhaust gas.

On the one side, the Nernst concentration cell 
is connected to the atmosphere by a refer-
ence-air channel (5), on the other it is con-
nected to the exhaust gas in the diffusion gap.
The sensor requires control-electronics 
circuitry to generate the sensor signal and 
to regulate the sensor temperature. 

An integral heater (3) heats up the sensor 
quickly so that it soon reaches its operating 
temperature of 650 to 900 °C needed for 
generating a usable signal. This function de-
cisively reduces the effects that the exhaust-
gas temperature has on the sensor signal.

Operating principle
The exhaust gas enters the actual measur-
ing chamber (diffusion gap) of the Nernst 
concentration cell through the pump cell’s 
small gas-access passage. In order that the 
excess-air factor l can be adjusted in the 
diffusion gap, the Nernst concentration 
cell compares the gas in the diffusion gap 
with that in the reference-air channel. 

The complete process proceeds as fol-

lows: by applying the pump voltage UP 
across the pump cell’s platinum elec-
trodes, oxygen from the exhaust gas can be 
pumped through the diffusion barrier and 
into or out of the diffusion gap. With the 
help of the Nernst concentration cell, an 
electronic circuit in the control unit con-

trols the voltage (UP) across the pump cell 
in order that the composition of the gas in 
the diffusion gap remains constant at l = 1. 
If the exhaust gas is lean, the pump cell 
pumps the oxygen to the outside (positive 
pump current). On the other hand, if the 
 exhaust gas is rich, the oxygen (due to the 
decomposition of CO2 and H2O at the ex-
haust-gas electrode) is pumped from the 
surrounding exhaust gas and into the diffu-
sion gap (negative pump current). At l = 1, 
no oxygen needs to be transported, and the 
pump current is zero. The pump current  
is proportional to the exhaust-gas oxygen 
concentration and is this a nonlinear mea-
sure for the excess-air factor l (Fig. 3).

Actuators

Actuators (final-control elements) form 
the interface between the electronic sig-
nal processor (data processing) and the 
actual process (mechanical motion). They 
convert the low-power signals conveying 
the positioning information into operat-
ing signals of an energy level adequate for 
process control. Signal transducers are 
combined with amplifier elements to ex-
ploit the physical transformation princi-
ples governing the inter relation ships be-
tween various forms of energy (electrical – 
mechanical – fluid – thermal).

Electromechanical actuators

This type of energy conversion represents 
one option for classifying electromechani-
cal actuators. The energy emanating from 
the source is transformed into magnetic  
or electrical field energy, or converted to 
thermal energy. The individual force-gen-
eration principle is determined by these 
forms of energy, and is based on either 
field forces or certain specific material 
characteristics. Magnetostrictive materials 
make it possible to design actuators for ap-
plications in the micropositioning range. 
This category also includes piezoelectric 
actuators, which are built according to a 
multilayer design similar to ceramic ca-
pacitors, and are actuators for high-speed 
fuel injectors. Thermal actuators depend 
exclusively on the exploitation of charac-
teristics of specific materials.

Actuators in a motor vehicle are mostly 
electromagneto-mechanical converters and, 
by extension, electrical servomotors, trans-
lational, and rotational solenoid actuators.

An exception is the pyrotechnic airbag 
 system. The solenoid actuators can them-
selves be the servo element, or they can 
assume a control function by governing  
a downstream amplifier (e.g. mechanical-
 hydraulic).

Force generation in the magnetic field
The distinction between the electrody-
namic and the electromagnetic actuator 
principles stems from the manner in which 
forces are generated in the magnetic field. 
Common to both principles is the magnetic 
circuit with soft-magnetic material and the 
coil for excitation of the magnetic field.  
A major difference lies in the force which 
can be extracted from the unit under tech-
nically feasible conditions. Under identical 
conditions, the force produced by applica-
tion of the electromagnetic principle is 
greater by a factor of 40. The electrical 
time constant for this type of actuator is 
comparable to the mechanical time con-
stants. Both force-generation principles 
are applied in linear and rotary drive 
mechanisms.

Electrodynamic principle
The electrodynamic principle is based  
on the force exerted on moving charges  
or charged conductors (Fig. 3a, current I) 
within a magnetic field (Lorentz force).  

3 Electrodynamic and electromagnetic converters

A field coil or a permanent magnet gener-
ates a DC magnetic field (magnetic flux 
density B). The electrical energy destined 
for conversion is applied (current I ) to the 
moving armature coil (immersion coil).  
A high degree of actuator precision is 
achieved by designing the armature coil 
with low mass and low inductance. The 
two energy accumulators (one on the fixed 
and one on the moving component) pro-
duce two active force directions via cur-
rent-direction reversal in the armature 
and field coils.

The secondary field produced by the 
 armature current flows in an open mag-
netic circuit, thereby diminishing the ef-
fects of saturation. Approximately speak-
ing, the force (torque) exerted by an elec-
trodynamic actuator over its setting range 
is proportional to current and indepen-
dent of travel.

Electromagnetic principle
The electromagnetic principle exploits  
the mutual attraction displayed by soft  
iron materials in a magnetic field. The elec-
tromagnetic actuator is equipped with only 
one coil, which generates both the field 
 energy and the energy to be transformed. 
In accordance with the operating princi-
ples, the field coil is equipped with an iron 
core to provide higher inductance.

However, as the force is proportional to  
the square of the magnetic flux density B, 
the unit is operative in only a single force-
transfer direction. The electromagnetic 
 actuator thus requires a return element 
(such as a mechanical spring or a magnetic 
return mechanism).

Dynamic response
The dynamic response of an electrome-
chanical actuator, i.e. the activation and 
deactivation operations, is defined by the 
equation of mechanical motion, the differ-
ential equation of electrical circuits and 
Maxwell’s equations of dynamics. The 
current- and position-dependent force 
follows from Maxwell’s equations.

The most basic electrical circuit con-
sists of an inductance with an ohmic re-
sistor. One means of enhancing the dy-
namic response is through over-excitation 
at the  instant of activation, while deacti-
vation can be accelerated by a Zener di-
ode, for example. In each case, increasing 
the dynamic response of the electric cir-
cuit involves additional expenditure and 
increased losses in the actuator’s trigger-
ing electronics.

Field diffusion is a delay effect which  
is difficult to influence in actuators with 
high dynamic response. Rapid switching 
operations are accompanied by high- 
frequency field fluctuations in the soft-
magnetic material of the actuator’s mag-
netic circuit. These fluctuations, in turn, 
induce eddy currents, which counteract 
their cause (build-up and decay of the 
magnetic field). The resultant delay in 
the build-up or reduction of forces can 
only be reduced by selecting appropriate 
materials with low electric conductivity 
and permeability.

Design
Design selection is essentially determined 
by operating conditions (i.e. installation 
space, required force/travel characteristic 
curve, and dynamic response).

Electromagnetic actuators
A typical form for translational electro-
magnetic actuators is the switching sole-
noid (Fig. 4) with a force/travel character-
istic curve which falls as a function of the 
square of positioning travel. The precise 
shape of the curve (Fig. 5) is determined 
by the type of working air gap (e.g. conical 
or solenoid armature).

Rotational electromagnetic actuators are 
characterized by a defined pole arrange-
ment in stator and rotor. When current is 
applied to one of the coils, the rotor and 
stator poles respond with mutual attrac-
tion, and in doing so generate a torque.

The single-winding rotary actuator (Fig. 6) 
incorporates a pair of poles in each of the 
two main sections, as well as a coil in the 
stator. Its maximum adjustment range is 
approx. 45°.

The torque motor (Fig. 7) is a bidirectional 
electromagnetic rotary actuator featuring 
a stable operating point and without coun-
terforces. The rotor is maintained in a sta-
ble position by the excitation field of the 
permanent magnet in the stator. The mag-
netic field generated by one or two stator 
windings produces torque and provides 
unilateral compensation for the excitation 
field. This type of layout is suitable for 
 applications in which substantial torque  
is required over small control angles.  
The  relationship between the applied 
 current and the torque motor’s force is 
roughly linear (Fig. 8). The torque-motor 
principle is also employed in translational 
actuators.

Electrodynamic actuators
In a pot magnet (immersion-coil actuator,  
Fig. 9) a cylindrical immersion coil (arma-
ture coil) is set in motion in a working air 
gap. The adjustment range is limited by the 
axial length of the armature coil and by the 
air gap.

The short-stroke linear motor (Fig. 10) is 
an actuator with a virtually round disk coil.

A distinction is made between single-wind-
ing and dual-winding rotary actuators 
(Fig. 11). Both types include a permanent 
magnet within the rotor and one or two 
 stator windings. The rotor magnet is mag-
netized at both ends to produce magnetic 
flux density in the rotary magnet’s working 
air gap, which combines with the armature 
current to produce a torque. Originating 
from the position illustrated, the adjust-
ment range is less than ±45°. The setting 
range of the single-winding rotary actuator 
also varies according to both the torque 
 requirement and the angle range in which 
the necessary flux density can be provided.

The dual-winding rotary actuator can be 
described as a combination of two single-
winding rotary actuators with a 90° pe-
ripheral offset and designed to produce 
opposed torque flows. A stable operating 
point is achieved at the zero transition 
point on the resulting torque curve with-
out auxiliary counterforces.

Application
Electromechanical actuators are direct-
 action control elements, and without an 
 intermediate ratio-conversion mechanism, 
they convert the energy of the electrical 
control signal into a mechanical position-
ing factor/work. Typical applications in-
clude positioning of flaps, sleeves, and 
valves. The described actuators are final-
control elements without internal return 
mechanisms, i.e. without a stable operat-
ing point. They are only capable of carry-
ing out positioning operations from a 
 stable initial position (operating point) 
when a counterforce is applied (e.g.  
return spring and electrical control). 

A solenoid armature provides a stable 
static operating point when its force/travel 
curve is superimposed on the characteris-
tic response of a return spring. A variation 
of the coil current in the solenoid shifts  
the operating point. Simple positioning  
is achieved by controlling the current. 
However, particular attention must be  
paid here to the nonlinearity of the force-
current characteristic and the positioning 
 system’s sensitivity to interference factors 
(e.g. mechanical friction, pneumatic, and 
hydraulic forces). The temperature sensi-
tivity of the coil resistance results in posi-
tioning errors, making corrective current 
control necessary. A high-precision posi-
tioning system with good dynamic response 
must incorporate a position sensor and a 
controller.

Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators utilize 
similar principles for the conversion and 
regulation of energy. Table 1 shows the 
 differences in characteristics and applica-
tions.

In most applications, fluid-mechanical 
actuator drives are in the form of hydro-
static energy converters. These operate 
according to the displacement principle, 
converting the pressure energy of the  
fluid medium into mechanical work and 
vice versa (Fig. 14).

In contrast, hydrodynamic transformers 
operate by converting flow energy (kinetic 
energy of the moving fluid) into mechani-
cal work (example: hydrodynamic clutch).
Losses during energy conversion stem 
from leakage and friction. Fluid-thermal 
losses are caused by flow resistance, in 
which throttle action transforms the hy-
draulic energy into heat. A portion of this 
heat is dissipated into the environment, 
and some of it is absorbed and carried 
away by the fluid medium:
Qheat  =  Q1 · p1  –  Q2 · p2

With incompressible fluids:
Qheat  =  Q1 · (p1  –  p2)

The flow develops into turbulence at re-
strictions. The flow rate of the fluid is then 
largely independent of viscosity. On the 
other hand, viscosity does play a role in 
the case of laminar flow in narrow pipes 
and apertures.

Fluid-mechanical amplifiers control  
the conversion of energy from fluid to 
 mechanical state. The regulating mecha-
nism must be designed for control with 
only a very small proportion of the energy 
flow required for the ultimate positioning 
operation.

Switching valves open and close the 
 orifice governing the flow to and from  
a fluid-mechanical energy converter  
(Fig. 15). Provided that the control-ele-
ment opens sufficiently, the throttling 
losses remain negligible. Pulse-width-
modulated opening and closing can be 
 applied to achieve quasi-continuous con-
trol of the fluid-mechanical energy con-
version process with virtually no losses.  
In practice, however, pressure fluctuations 
and mechanical contact between the valve 
elements result in undesirable vibration 
and noise.

Electrical machines

Electrical machines are used to convert 
electrical and mechanical energy. An elec-
tric motor converts electrical energy into 
mechanical energy, and an alternator con-
verts energy in the opposite direction. 
 Electrical machines (Fig. 16) consist of a 
stationary component (the stator) and a ro-
tating component (the rotor or armature). 
There are special designs which  depart 
from this configuration, such as  linear 
 machines which produce linear  motion.
Permanent magnets or several coils 
(windings) are used to produce magnetic 
fields in the stator and rotor. This causes 
torque to develop between the two ma-
chine components. Electrical machines 
have iron stators and rotors in order to 
control the magnetic fields. As the mag-
netic fluxes change over time, stators and 
rotors must consist of stacks of individual 
laminations which are insulated with re-
spect to one another (to minimize eddy-
current losses). 

The spatial arrangement of the coils  
and the type of current used (direct cur-
rent, alternating current, or three-phase 
current) permit a number of different elec-
trical machine designs. They differ from 
one another in the way they operate, and 
therefore have different applications.

16 Layout of an electrical machine

Direct-current machines
The stator of a direct-current machine 
contains salient poles which are magne-
tized by the direct-current excitation 
windings. In the rotor (here also called  
the armature), the coils are distributed 
among slots in the laminated iron core  
and connected to a commutator. Carbon 
brushes in the stator housing wipe against 
the commutator as it rotates, thereby 
transferring direct current to the armature 
coils. The rotary motion of the commutator 
causes a reversal in the direction of cur-
rent flow in the coils. The different rota-
tional speed vs. torque characteristics re-
sult from the method selected for connect-
ing the excitation winding and armature.

Asynchronous machines
The laminated rotor contains either a 
three-phase winding, as in the stator, or a 
rod winding. The three-phase winding is 
connected to sliprings which are short-cir-
cuited either directly or via series resistors 
(Fig. 19). In the case of the rod winding, 
the bars are connected to one another by 
two short-circuiting rings (squirrel-cage 
rotor). As long as the rotational speed of 
the rotor deviates from n0, the rotating 
 stator field induces current in the rotor 
windings, thereby generating torque. 
 Deviation of the rotational speed of the 
 rotor n from n0 is termed slip s:
s = (n0 − n) / n0

Continuous-running operation is only 
 economical in the vicinity of n0 because 
losses increase as slip increases (nominal 
slip ≤ 5%). In this range the asynchronous 
machine has a shunt characteristic. The 
machine operates as a motor when n < n0, 
and as an alternator when n > n0. The di-
rection of rotation is changed by reversing 
two of the phases.

The asynchronous machine is the most 
frequently used electric motor in the field 
of drive engineering. With a squirrel-cage 
rotor it is easy to operate, and requires 
 little maintenance.

cage rotor

b

A shunt characteristic can also be obtained 
by using a separate power supply for the 
excitation winding (external excitation)  
or by using permanent-magnet excitation 
in the stator. 

Applications for permanent-field motors 

in motor vehicles: starter, windshield 
wiper, and low-power motors for various 
drives. 

If the motor incorporates both series and 
shunt excitation windings (compound-
wound motor), intermediate levels in the 
rotational speed/torque characteristic  
can be obtained. 

Application: e.g. large starters.

All direct-current machines are easily ca-
pable of speed control over a wide range. 
If the machine incorporates a static con-
verter which allows adjustment of the ar-
mature voltage, the torque and therefore 
the rotational speed are infinitely variable. 
The rotational speed can be further in-
creased by reducing the excitation current 
(field weakening) when the rated armature 
voltage is reached. A disadvantage of di-
rect-current machines is carbon-brush 
and commutator wear which makes regu-
lar maintenance necessary.

Three-phase machines
A three-phase winding is distributed 
among the stator slots in a three-phase 
machine. The three phases of current 
 produce a rotating magnetic field.  
The speed n0 (in rpm) of this rotating 
field is calculated as follows:

n0 = 60 ⋅ f / p

f = frequency (in Hz) 
p = number of pole pairs

Three-phase machines are either synchro-
nous or asynchronous, depending on rotor 
design.

Synchronous machines
In the rotor (here, also called the pole 
wheel), the poles are magnetized by di-
rect-current coils. The excitation current  
is usually transferred via two sliprings to 
the rotor. The pole wheel can be made of 
solid steel, because the magnetic flux re-
mains constant over time. Constant torque 
is generated as long as the rotor rotates at 
a speed of n0. At other speeds, the torque 
fluctuates periodically between a positive 
and a negative maximum value, and exces-
sively high current is produced. For this 
reason, a synchronous machine is not self-
starting. The synchronous machine also 
differs from the asynchronous machine  
in that the reactive power absorption and 
generation are adjustable. 

The synchronous machine is most fre-
quently used as a generator of energy sup-
ply in electric power plants. Synchronous 
motors are used in cases where constant 

motor speed based on constant line fre-
quency is desired, or where a reactive 
power demand exists. The automotive 
three-phase alternator is a special type  
of synchronous machine.

The rotational speed of all three-phase 
machines is determined by the stator fre-
quency. Such machines can operate over  
a wide range of speeds if used in conjunc-
tion with static converters which vary the 
frequency.

EC motors
The “electronically commutated direct-
current” or “EC” motor is becoming in-
creasingly popular (Fig. 21). It is essen-
tially a permanent-magnet synchronous 
machine, and is brushless. The EC motor  
is equipped with a rotor-position sensor, 
and is connected to the DC power source 
through its control and power electronics. 
The electronic transfer circuit switches the 
current in the stator winding according to 
rotor position – the magnets which induce 
the excitation current are attached to the 
rotor – to provide the interdependence be-
tween rotational speed and torque which 
is normally associated with a separately 
excited direct-current machine. The re-
spective magnetic functions of the stator and 
rotor are the opposite of what they would be 
in a classical direct-current machine.

The EC motor’s potential applications 
are a result of the advantages which this 
drive principle provides: commutator and 
carbon brushes are replaced by electron-
ics, dispensing with both brush noise and 
wear. EC motors are maintenance-free 
(long service life) and can be constructed 
to meet high degrees of protection. The 
electronic control feature makes it easy  
for drive units with EC motors to incorpo-
rate auxiliary functions such as infinitely 
variable speed governing, direction rever-
sal, soft starts, and antilock protection.

The main areas of automotive application 
are in the HVAC (Heating/Ventilation/Air-
Conditioning) sectors, and for pumps and 
servo units. In the area of production ma-
chinery, EC motors are chiefly employed 
as precision drive units for feed-control  
in machine tools. Here the decisive advan-
tages are freedom from maintenance, 
 favorable dynamic properties and consis-
tent torque output with minimal ripple.

Single-phase alternating-current 
 machines
Universal motors
The direct-current series-wound motor 
can be operated on alternating current if  
a laminated rather than a solid iron stator 
is used. It is then called a universal motor.
When operated on alternating current,  
a torque component at twice the frequency 
of the current is superposed on the con-
stant torque component.

Single-phase asynchronous motors 
with squirrel-cage rotor
The simplest design of a single-phase 
asynchronous motor is a three-phase 
asynchronous machine in which alternat-
ing current is supplied to only two stator 
phases. Although its operation remains 
largely the same, the power and the maxi-
mum torque are reduced. In addition,  
the single-phase asynchronous machine  
is not self-starting.

Machines which are intended only for 
single-phase operation have only a single-
phase main winding in the stator, as well  
as auxiliary starting circuits. The stator 
also contains an auxiliary winding con-
nected in parallel with the main winding 
for this purpose. The necessary phase dis-
placement of the auxiliary winding current 
can be achieved through increased wind-
ing resistance (low breakaway torque) or 
by means of a capacitor connected in se-
ries with the auxiliary winding (somewhat 
greater breakaway torque).

The auxiliary winding is switched off 
 after the motor starts. The direction of ro-
tation of the motor is changed by reversing 
the two auxiliary or main winding connec-
tions. A motor which has a capacitor in 
 series with the auxiliary winding is called 
a capacitor motor. Capacitor motors with 
a starting and running capacitor also oper-
ate continuously with capacitor and auxil-
iary winding. Optimum operation for a 
specific operating point can be achieved 
by correct selection of capacitor. An addi-
tional capacitor is often used in order to 
increase the starting torque; this capacitor 
is then disconnected after the motor starts.

Duty-type ratings for electrical machines 
(VDE 0530)
S1: Continuous-running duty
Operation under constant load (rated 
 output) of sufficient duration to reach  
the thermal steady-state condition.

S2: Short-time-duty type
Operation under constant load is so brief 
that the thermal steady-state condition  
is not reached. The rest period is so long 
that the machine is able to cool down to 
the temperature of the coolant.

Recommended short-time-duty types: 

10, 30, 60 and 90 min.

S3 to S5: Intermittent-periodic duty
Continuous alternating sequence of load 
and idle periods. The thermal steady-state 
condition is not reached during the load 
period or during the cooling period of  
one duty cycle.
▶  S3 intermittent-periodic duty without 
influence of starting on temperature

▶  S4 intermittent-periodic duty with 

 influence of starting on temperature

▶  S5 intermittent-periodic duty with 

 influence of starting and braking on 
temperature

S6: Continuous operation with intermittent 
loading
Operation with intermittent loading. 
 Continuous alternating sequence of load 
periods and no-load periods, otherwise  
as S3.

S7: Uninterrupted duty
Operation with starting and braking.

S8: Uninterrupted duty
Operation with pole-changing.
For S3 and S6, the duty cycle time is 10 mins 
unless otherwise agreed; and recommended 
values for relative switch-on duration are 
15, 25, 40 and 60 %. For S2, S3 and S6, the 
operating time or the duty cycle time and 
the switch-on duration are to be specified 
after the rating; the duty cycle time is only 
to be specified if it differs from 10 mins. 
Example: S2 – 60 mins, S3 – 25 %.

Relative switch-on duration
The relative switch-on duration is the ratio 
of the loading period, including starting 
and braking, to the cycle time.

Winding temperature
The mean temperature t2 of the windings

Serial hybrid drive
The series connection of the energy con-
verters is indicative of a serial hybrid con-
cept. The serial arrangement of the hybrid 
components requires two electric motors 
and an internal-combustion engine. An 
electric motor operates as an alternator, 
and the other as an engine. The internal-
combustion engine is not connected to  
the drive. It charges the battery via the 
 alternator and/or provides the electric 
 motor with the required energy directly. 
All of the power that is needed to move 
the vehicle is therefore transmitted to the 
drive shaft by the electric motor. 

An advantage of this arrangement is that 
the internal-combustion engine can be 
 operated almost stationary, i.e. within its 
optimum efficiency range. Because there  
is no mechanical connection, the electric 
motor and the internal-combustion engine 
can be installed in different locations.

One disadvantage of this arrangement lies 
in the multiple energy conversions and as-
sociated loss of efficiency. If you examine 
the normal mean loss of the individual 
components, a total loss of about 30 % 
must be assumed.

Hybrid drives

As well as optimizing conventional drive 
concepts, motor vehicle manufacturers 
also rely on alternative concepts in order 
to ensure that existing and future noise 
and emission restrictions are complied 
with and reduce fuel consumption.
The use of hybrid cars as a means of 
 reducing environmental pollution and 
increasing driving pleasure and comfort 
is becoming increasingly popular. 

A design which combines electric motor(s) 
with an internal-combustion engine makes 
it possible to use smaller engines (down-
sizing) and other consumption-reducing 
measures such as stopping the engine at 
traffic lights, operating the engine within 
the optimum efficiency range, and recu-
perative braking. Hybrid drives allow most 
of the basic weaknesses of electric or in-
ternal-combustion engine drive concepts 
to be eliminated.

Drive concepts

Definition
Hybrid cars are vehicles whose accelera-
tive force is provided by more than one 
source. These drive sources obtain the 
 energy that is required from a variety of 
sources. The term that is currently used  
to describe these vehicles is HEV (Hybrid 
Electrical Vehicle), i.e. the combined de-
sign of an internal-combustion engine with 
one or two electric motors and the associ-
ated energy accumulators (fuel tank and 
battery). 

Types of hybrid drive
A distinction is made between two basic 
structures:
•  serial and 
•  parallel hybrid drives.

A design which combines both structures 
is described as a split-power hybrid drive.

It has only been possible to make mean-
ingful use of serial drive concepts since 
the mid-80’s. Until this time, neither elec-
trical machines nor storage media with  
the required capacity for realizing serial 
concepts were available. 

A serial hybrid system is used in the 
Toyota Coaster (Bus) Hybrid, for example. 
Other usage areas for the serial hybrid 
drive are diesel trains and busses that 
 frequently travel in stop-and-go traffic  
in urban areas. The serial hybrid drive  
is not used in passenger cars, however.

Parallel hybrid drive
The term “parallel hybrid drive” is used to 
describe an arrangement of hybrid compo-
nents in which the electric motor and the 
internal-combustion engine can both indi-
vidually deliver their output to the drive.  
If necessary, the outputs can be combined 
by means of mechanically coupling the 
motor and the engine to the drive. The 
possibility of power addition allows the 
machines to be made with relatively small 
dimensions without adversely affecting 
the driving performance. The components 
that are required are designed according 
to the most frequent area of use. 

There are different types of implementa-
tion. The electric motor can be directly 
flanged to the crankshaft (crankshaft-
mounted starter-alternator) or coupled  
to the internal-combustion engine by a 
belt drive. Both drive sources can be used 
together or individually to propel the vehi-
cle. Since only one electric motor is incor-
porated in the system, the vehicle cannot 
be electrically powered whilst the battery 
is being charged. The electric motor can 
only operate as an alternator or for drive 
purposes. 

If a coupling is integrated between the 
electric motor and the internal-combus-
tion engine (Fig. 2), the engine does not 
have to be carried along when the vehicle 
is being propelled using purely electric 
power. Drag torque losses can therefore  
be avoided.

The drive-side positioning of the electric 

motor, i.e. directly on the drive shaft 
downstream of the transmission, makes it 
possible to prevent transmission efficiency 
losses.

Split-power hybrid drive
The split-power hybrid drive arrangement 
(Fig. 3) is a combination of the two princi-
ples that were mentioned previously.

The use of a split-power transmission 
(planetary gear system) allows some of the 
internal-combustion engine power to be 
relayed directly to the drive, i.e mechani-
cally, whereas the other part is converted 
into electrical energy via the alternator 
and optionally stored in the HV battery 
(high-voltage battery) or directly relayed 
to the driving electric motor downstream 
of the transmission.

Both the electric motor and the internal-
combustion engine can be used as drives 
in this combined design. The most con-
sumption-efficient drive method is used 
for the prevailing operating conditions. 
Both drives can also provide their power 
simultaneously for propelling the vehicle. 
It is also possible to use electricity only.

The use of the planetary gear system in 

combination with the alternator as a 
torque support allows the operating point 
of the internal-combustion engine to be 
varied within its optimum range, similarly 
to a combination with a CVT transmis-
sion1). The planetary gear system is one 
of the main component parts of the split-
power hybrid concept. No additional 
transmission is required for the internal-
combustion engine. 

This is a form of the strong hybrid that  

is used in the Toyota Prius, for example.

Use of internal-combustion engine  
and electric motor in the different 
 hybrid systems
In the serial hybrid, the internal-combus-
tion engine supplies the electric motor 
with energy. The vehicle is only propelled 
by the electric motor.

The parallel hybrid with an electric motor 
fixed to the crankshaft uses the internal-
combustion engine as its main energy 
source. The electric motor is used for as-
sistance during acceleration. Otherwise it 
is mainly the internal-combustion engine 
that is used.

In the parallel hybrid that can use elec-
tric power only, the electric motor is used 
more frequently and the internal-combus-
tion engine less frequently than in a paral-
lel hybrid with an electric motor fixed to 
the crankshaft. 

In a split-power hybrid, the output of 
the internal-combustion engine is appor-
tioned. This process is infinitely variable. 
For this reason the electric drive continu-
ously operates when the vehicle is being 
propelled by the internal-combustion en-
gine, without affecting the frequency at 
which purely electric propulsion is used. 

Hybrid drive classification
Figure 4 shows an example of classifica-
tion according to degree of hybridization. 
The engine start-stop, recuperative brak-
ing, boosting (electric motor support) and 
electric-only propulsion methods that are 
shown can be realized using the following 
hybrid concepts. It remains to be said that 
both the structural and financial cost and 
the fuel-saving potential can vary consid-
erably depending on the concept that is 
used. 

The way in which the electrical and inter-
nal-combustion engine components are 
combined and interconnected is another 
means of distinguishing between types of 
hybrid. A distinction is also made between 
the degree of hybridization and the type  
of energy flow. The operating strategy that 
is used is another distinguishing feature. 
There are no fixed definitions or names  
for the many distinguishing features.  
They depend on the respective vehicle 
manufacturer or supplier.

1) With CVT transmis-

sions (Continuously 

Variable Transmission) 

the force is transmitted 

via pulling media such  

as wide V-belts or lami-

nated toothed chains. 

The main components 

are two axially movable  

V-pulleys with a pulling 

medium running be-

tween them. A continu-

ous conversion ratio 

can be achieved.

Hybrid drives  |  Drive concepts  |  369

Strong Hybrid
Strong hybrid systems make it possible  
to drive in urban traffic using electrical en-
ergy only and therefore without producing 
emissions. The traction accumulator of 
these systems is more powerful than those 
of the above-mentioned micro hybrid and 
mild hybrid variants. It has a typical out-
put of about 25 to 50 kW. 

The mild hybrid system is more expensive 
to implement than other hybrid systems. 
On the one hand, the vehicle electrical sys-
tem has to be adapted to the voltages and 
currents that are required, and on the 
other hand, additional components such 
as couplings and transmissions are needed 
to ensure that the vehicle can be propelled 
using electric power only. Examples of 
strong hybrid systems are the parallel 
 hybrid with two couplings (Fig. 2) and  
the split-power system such as the one 
used by Toyota (Fig. 3).

Micro Hybrid (start/stop system)
The simplest form and the first step in the 
direction of hybrid vehicles is the micro 
hybrid, e.g. a starter/alternator system 
with start/stop function. In this system the 
starter and the alternator are replaced 
with an electrical machine. The internal-
combustion engine is switched off when 
the vehicle stops. When the vehicle sets off 
again it is quietly accelerated to idle speed 
by the electrical machine, and then the ig-
nition is activated. In the simplest micro 
hybrid system, the conventional starter  
is replaced with a starter that has been 
 optimized for start-stop functionality. 
These systems generally only have a small 
energy accumulator and comparatively 
little electrical power.

Mild Hybrid
If this system is combined with the start/
stop, booster (internal-combustion engine 
assisted by the electric motor when start-
ing off and accelerating) and brake energy 
recovery strategies, it is usually referred to 
as a mild hybrid concept. Electric propul-
sion is possible for an extremely short time 
in combination with cylinder shutoff, but 
the internal-combustion engine must also 
be carried along. 

The electric motor can be directly 

flanged to the crankshaft in a mild hybrid. 
In mild hybrid systems, additional electri-
cal energy of up to 20 kW is provided by 
the electric traction accumulator (battery). 
This is mainly used for starting off and 
 accelerating at low engine rpm.

Operating strategies for 
electric hybrid vehicles

The integration of electrical components 
in the drivetrain has wide-ranging effects 
on the overall vehicle system. Because  
of the complexity of the drivetrain in  
an electric hybrid vehicle (HEV: Hybrid 
Electric Vehicles), system solutions with 
mutually coordinated components are  
of special significance. As well as having  
a  favorable combination of appropriate 
components, the optimization of the oper-
ating strategy is the most important task  
in order to achieve the goals of reducing 
consumption and emissions while increas-
ing driving pleasure and driving comfort.  
HEV functions that reduce consumption 
and emissions are start/stop operation of 
the internal-combustion engine, recupera-
tive braking and operating point optimiza-
tion. 

The electric propulsion function is an im-
portant constituent of operating point op-
timization. Booster operation of the elec-

5 Networking of control systems in the drivetrain

tric drive can increase the torque and 
therefore provide improved acceleration 
capability, particularly at low engine rpm. 
An integrated examination of design and 
strategy optimization is required in order 
to utilize the maximum potential. In this 
case, operating strategy means a driving 
situation-dependent torque distribution 
between the two drive sources of internal-
combustion engine and electric motor.

Figure 5 shows the networking of the indi-
vidual components in the drivetrain using 
the example of a vehicle with a parallel 
 hybrid drive. The entire system is coordi-
nated by a supervisory hybrid controller. 
This involves battery management, engine 
management, electric drive management, 
transmission management and brake sys-
tem management. It becomes clear that  
the development of these control systems 
(particularly the supervisory hybrid con-
troller) and the development of the com-
ponents have to be closely interlinked in 
order to achieve optimum functionality.

Hybrid drives  |  Operating strategies  |  371

Influence of operating strategy on  
the design of the internal-combustion 
engine
Use of suitable internal-combustion 
 engines
Any internal-combustion engine from 
 vehicles with a conventional drivetrain  
can generally be used in a hybrid vehicle. 
Gasoline, natural gas and diesel engines 
can be combined with an electrical drive, 
but with differing optimization targets  
(see sections “Operating strategy for diesel 
hybrid vehicles/gasoline hybrid vehicles”).

The additional possibilities provided by 
the HEV combination with regard to oper-
ating point adjustments, for example, can 
be pursued for hybrid vehicles and other 
internal-combustion engine concepts,  
as well as for conventionally propelled 
 vehicles. Because the operating range has 
been made smaller, the efficiency optimi-
zation that is needed can be restricted to 
this area and the high costs of providing 
additional components can be avoided. 

If an adequate amount of power is pro-
vided by the electrical accumulator, the 
electric drive can compensate for torque 
deficits and slower response behavior 
found in certain internal-combustion 
 engine concepts. 

The dynamic requirements that are 
made of the drivetrain are realized by 
combining the electric drive and the 
 internal-combustion engine. The torque 
characteristic, which is particularly favor-
able at low engine speeds, and the rapid 
response behavior of the electric drive 
 relieve the strain on the internal-combus-
tion engine during dynamic processes. 
 Internal-combustion engine peak loads 
can therefore be avoided.

Internal-combustion engine friction 
 optimization
Part of the primary energy reduction in a 
hybrid vehicle is achieved by reclaiming 
braking energy (recuperation). This can be 
carried out during active braking and un-
der overrun conditions, e.g. when driving 
downhill. In order to make maximum use 
of this saving potential, the internal-com-
bustion engine must be shut down in these 
operating ranges. If this is not possible, the 
engine must be carried along and its drag 
friction restricts the recuperation poten-
tial. In this case, optimizing the friction of 
the engine represents an important inter-
nal-combustion engine requirement. 

Emission and fuel consumption 
 optimization
In order to achieve emission and con-
sumption reduction targets, degrees of 
freedom for internal-combustion engine 
operation can be exploited that depend  
on the topology of the drivetrain. 

Avoiding operating points where the in-
ternal-combustion engine is less efficient 
or has high emissions is an important 
strategy. The basic operating strategy must 
be optimized with regard to the improve-
ment target (e.g. consumption reduction 
and CO2 or NOx reduction). The modified 
operating conditions can be exploited to 
optimize the internal-combustion engine 
concept and the exhaust-gas treatment. 
The modified requirements result in 
changes to the functionality and applica-
tion of the engine management system  
that are not examined in further detail  
at this point.

A requirement currently exists for im-
provements to be made in vehicles with 
diesel engines with regard to NOx and par-
ticulate emissions. Improvements can be 
achieved here by shifting the engine oper-
ating points in lower emission ranges. 

372  |  Hybrid drives  |  Operating strategies

If a gasoline or natural gas engine is used, 
the operating strategy is designed to save 
fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. 

medium loads in conventional vehicles, 
and therefore in ranges with high  
NOX emissions.

Operating strategy for diesel hybrid 
 vehicles
Particularly in part-load operation, 
 vehicles with lean combustion concepts 
achieve low consumption values but have 
higher exhaust-gas values than vehicles 
with stoichiometrically operated internal-
combustion engines. The main focus as  
far as diesel vehicles are concerned is 
therefore on reducing emissions. The post-
combustion reduction of hydrocarbon and 
carbon monoxide emissions from lean 
 internal-combustion engines using oxida-
tion-type catalytic converters is in an ad-
vanced stage of development. Diesel par-
ticulate filters with high exhaust cleaning 
efficiency are already being used to reduce 
particulate emissions. The primary goal as 
far as diesel hybrid vehicles are concerned 
is to reduce nitrogen-oxide emissions 
(NOX), whereby the intention is also to 
 reduce CO2 emissions at the same time.

Figure 6 shows the best ranges in which to 
operate the internal-combustion engine in 
order to optimize NOX emissions. 

Figure 6a shows the operating point range 
for an internal-combustion engine during 
a driving cycle. In the New European Driv-
ing Cycle (NEDC), internal-combustion en-
gines are operated at low part loads and 

Figure 6b shows a hybrid vehicle with  
a parallel concept that avoids low internal-
combustion engine loads (unfavorable effi-
ciency) by operating with electricity only. 
Since the characteristic curve ranges of 
low NOX emissions are at low loads, the 
electric motor and the internal-combus-
tion engine should be used in conjunction 
(boost) in order to avoid engine operation 
at high loads. 

The electrical energy that is required 
cannot usually be recovered by means  
of recuperation alone, and the electrical 
machine is subsequently operated in alter-
nator mode. This means that the electric 
drive alternates between engine mode  
and electric mode almost continuously, 
 depending on the cycle. A compromise 
must be found between two opposing 
goals: on the one hand, the NOX and CO2 
emissions must be lowered as much as 
possible, and on the other hand, the en-
ergy throughput from the electric accu-
mulator must be  restricted. The energy 
throughput has a significant influence on 
the service life of the traction battery.

Figure 6c shows the situation for a split-
power hybrid vehicle in which flexible use 
is made of the internal-combustion engine 
speed (within certain limits), indepen-
dently of the vehicle speed (ECVT effect).

to faster speeds, which reduces the inter-
nal-combustion engine torques that are 
needed, leading to additional NOX reduc-
tion. 

Because of the serial operating mode on 

the electrical path (simultaneous alterna-
tor operation of the first electric motor 
and engine operation of the other), the 
traction battery energy throughput and 
 cycling can be kept lower than with a 
 parallel hybrid.

Operating strategy and internal-
 combustion engine concepts for 
 gasoline hybrid vehicles
The lowest emission values are achieved 
with vehicles with stoichiometrically oper-
ated gasoline internal-combustion engines 
due to the three-way catalytic converter 
technology. The lowest emissions can also 
be achieved with large-displacement inter-
nal-combustion engines in hybrid vehicles 
by using appropriate warm-up strategies. 
It may even be possible to reduce the de-
mands that are made on the exhaust-gas 
treatment system. The main objective with 
the gasoline hybrid vehicle is therefore to 
save fuel and increase performance.

Figure 7 shows a possible internal-com-
bustion engine operating range optimiza-
tion with regard to minimal CO2 emissions 
for the three HEV topologies (i.e. con-
sumption reduction). 

In the New European Driving Cycle 
(NEDC), internal-combustion engines are 
operated in conventional vehicles with a 
low part load and therefore at sub-optimal 
efficiency. In vehicles with a parallel hy-
brid drive, low internal-combustion engine 
loads can be avoided by driving with elec-
tric propulsion only (Fig. 7b). 

Since the electrical energy that is re-
quired cannot usually be recovered by 
means of recuperation alone, the electrical 
machine is subsequently operated in alter-
nator mode. In comparison to a conven-
tional vehicle, this moves the operation of 
the internal-combustion engine into the 
higher load range and therefore to a higher 
level of efficiency. This means that more 
electrical energy can be made available 
than with the previously described  
NOX strategy, making it possible to use 
a greater proportion of electrical propul-
sion. However, a compromise must be 
found between CO2 emissions and energy 
throughput because of the service life re-
quirements that are made of the traction 
battery. The energy throughput has a sig-
nificant influence on the service life of the 
traction battery.

The operating range of the internal-com-
bustion engine in the split-power hybrid 
vehicle (Fig. 7c) is more restricted than it is 
in the parallel hybrid vehicle. It is usually 
operated speed-dependently when engine 
loading is such that it allows the entire

drivetrain to operate in the most energy-
efficient way. Because of the serial operat-
ing mode on the electric path (simultane-
ous alternator and engine operation of 
both electrical machines), here too the 
 energy throughput and cycling of the trac-
tion battery can be kept low in comparison 
to a parallel hybrid.

Definition in the finite state machine
However, torque distribution is not needed 
in all driving conditions. Figure 8 shows 
the different driving conditions of a hybrid 
vehicle, which are defined in a finite state 
machine depending on driver request,  
the status of the electric accumulator and 
vehicle speed.

Operating point optimization: 
drive torque distribution
Different forms of hybrid vehicle control 
and different operating strategy optimiza-
tions have significant effects on fuel con-
sumption, emissions, the amount of avail-
able torque and the design of the compo-
nents (e.g. operating range of the electrical 
machine and the internal-combustion en-
gine, energy throughput and cycling of the 
electric accumulator), since their operat-
ing points are directly dependent on the 
operating strategy. It has already become 
clear that the system-encompassing hybrid 
controller is extremely important. There 
are many options and degrees of freedom 
for optimizing operation. The distribution 
of the requested drive torque to the inter-
nal-combustion engine and electrical ma-
chine drive sources is extremely important 
with regard to exploiting the fuel saving 
potential. 

The internal-combustion engine is shut 
down in the event of all-electric propul-
sion or recuperation and the maximum 
available torque is requested from both 
drive sources during boost operation.  
All-electric driving mode is restricted to 
slow vehicle speeds and low acceleration. 
Recuperation only occurs during vehicle 
deceleration. Boost operation is mainly 
used when maximum accelerative force  
is requested by the driver (kick-down). 

Distribution by operating strategy
The expansive scope of hybrid propulsion 
in which the drive torque distribution 
must be specified lies between the operat-
ing statuses that are defined by the finite 
state machine. Because of the many de-
grees of freedom and the large number of 
interdependent factors, an optimization is 
required that can be achieved most effec-
tively using model-based procedures.

Since it is not usually possible to generate 
enough energy from recuperation alone 
and the battery has limited storage capa-
bility, internal-combustion engine charg-
ing is unavoidable. In order to minimize 
the amount of fuel that is used to do this, 
this type of electrical-energy generation 
should only be performed when the inter-
nal-combustion engine is being used in 
low-efficiency operating ranges and the 
additional load can be used to improve 
 efficiency. The optimum utilization of the 
efficiency improvement during internal-
combustion engine charging is an operat-
ing strategy issue, since it involves torque 
distribution between the internal-combus-
tion engine and the electric machine.

Figure 9 shows the operating strategy de-
pendencies. The hybrid controller distrib-
utes the required drive torque between the 
drive sources of internal-combustion en-
gine and electrical machine on the basis of 
vehicle speed and the status of the electric 
accumulator, among other things. The op-
erating strategy also needs an equivalence 
value of the stored electrical energy that 
indicates how much fuel has been con-
sumed in generating this electrical energy. 

The different types of electrical power 
generation (recuperation and internal-
combustion engine charging) are exam-
ined in order to assign an optimization 
 parameter equivalence value (e.g. fuel 
consumption) to the energy content of  
the battery. This equivalence value forms 
the basis for deciding which energy source 
to use.

Power generation strategy
In a hybrid vehicle, electrical energy can 
be generated by means of internal-com-
bustion engine charging and recuperation 
(brake energy recovery). Whereas the lat-
ter is acquired without using fuel, the for-
mer requires fuel consumption. The effi-
ciency of this charging process depends 
on the current operating point of the 
 internal-combustion engine during this 
process.

Recuperative brake system

In order to make better use of a hybrid 
drive system, it must be possible to charge 
the electrical energy accumulator effi-
ciently. An adequate amount of electrical 
energy must be made available for
 ▶ The frequent internal-combustion 

 engine repeat starts that occur under 
certain circumstances with the micro 
hybrid 

 ▶ Electric torque support or electric 

 driving mode in mild or strong hybrid 
systems 

The electrical energy for charging the 
 battery can be provided by increasing the 
load of the internal-combustion engine or 
by operating the electric motor as an alter-
nator. On the other hand, the vehicle’s 
 kinetic energy during deceleration pro-
cesses can also be used. This energy is 
converted to heat in conventional vehicles 
either by the engine-drag torque or by  
the vehicle service brake by operating  
the brake pedal. 

By using the electric motor as an alterna-
tor, hybrid vehicles open up the possibility 
of reclaiming at least some of the energy 
and using it for electric consumers or the 
vehicle’s electric drive. This procedure us 
referred to as recuperative or regenerative 
braking. 

Recuperative braking strategies
Concept
In a strong hybrid the internal-combustion 
engine is decoupled for recuperative brak-
ing and the drag torque is replaced by  
an equivalent electric motor alternator 
torque (drag torque simulation). The en-
ergy that is released is stored. If the inter-
nal-combustion engine cannot be decou-
pled (as with a mild hybrid), a lower 
 alternator torque can be applied to the 
drivetrain in addition to the drag torque  
of the internal-combustion engine  
(drag torque increase). 

However, taking the driving behavior into 
consideration, no major braking decelera-
tion can be achieved by simulating or in-
creasing the drag torque. The different 
 recuperative brake torques that occur 
 during individual braking procedures and 
the resulting braking power variations are 
problematic. These must be adapted to the 
battery charge level and the thermal load 
of the electric drive. If significant battery 
temperature increase occurs after several 
braking procedures, the recuperative out-
put may need to be reduced in order to 
prevent the system from overheating.

Cooperative recuperative brake system
In order to exploit more kinetic energy,  
the service brake system must be modified 
at higher braking deceleration levels.  
This is done by replacing some or all of the 
service brake friction torque with recuper-
ated brake torque without changing the 
vehicle deceleration with the brake pedal 
position in the same position and using the 
same amount of pressure. This is achieved 
in the cooperative recuperative brake sys-
tem by making the vehicle controller and 
the brake system interact in such a way 
that the friction brake torque is always re-
duced by exactly the amount of alternator 
brake torque that can be replaced by the 
electric motor. 

Requirements
A cooperative recuperative brake system 
must be able to perform the following 
 requirements:
 ▶ Determine driver braking deceleration 

request

 ▶ Maintain the service brake performance 
capability and operation that is usual in 
conventional vehicles

 ▶ Determine a suitable brake torque 

distribution between the friction brake 
and the recuperative brake, taking sta-
bility, comfort and efficiency criteria 
into consideration

 ▶ Determine a suitable brake torque

 ▶ Adjust the friction brake torque

Replacing the recuperative brake torque 
with the friction brake torque requires a 
suitable data interface between the drive-
train and the brake control unit.

Cooperative braking maneuver
The maximum alternator torque that can 
be achieved by the electric motor changes 
continuously over a wide speed range 
 during braking (Fig. 10). This is due to the 
fact that the output of the electric motor  
(i.e. torque * speed) is constant within  
this range. The electric motor only has a 
constant maximum torque range at slow 
speeds. If the speed becomes even slower, 
the recuperative brake torque that can be 
achieved drops back down to zero.

There must be constant torque at the 
wheels in order to have constant vehicle 
braking deceleration. If the electric motor 
that is being operated as an alternator is 
utilized up to its limit torque, the friction 
brake torque must be continuously 
 reduced as the speed drops due to the  
fact that the alternator torque increases. 
 Figure 11 shows an example of the braking 
procedure of a split-power hybrid. At the 
beginning of the maneuver, the alternator 
torque is increased until it reaches its 
maximum (if this corresponds to the 
 required total brake torque). Towards  
the end of the braking maneuver, the alter-
nator torque is reduced and completely 
 replaced with friction braking torque be-
cause the electric motor cannot provide 
any more alternator torque at extremely 
low rpm (Fig. 10). 

When braking from a fast speed to a stand-
still, the distribution between friction 
brake torque and recuperative brake 
torque is continuously adjusted if the 
pedal is operated with constant pressure.

Braking-force distribution
Like conventional brake systems, when  
a recuperative brake system is being 
 designed, the braking-force distribution 
between the front axle and the rear axle  
is extremely important for the directional 
stability of the vehicle. The normal force 
on the wheels of the front axle increases 
together with braking deceleration, 
whereas the normal force on the wheels  
of the rear axle decreases. 

If the electric motor is connected to the 
wheels of the front axle, additional wheel 
torque can be transmitted at the front axle 
as the braking deceleration and therefore 
the normal force increases. The friction 
value utilization at the front axle should 
therefore not increase the friction value 
utilization of the rear axle in order to ob-
tain directional stability.

If the vehicle has rear-wheel drive or an 

electrically powered rear axle (i.e. inter-
nal-combustion engine at the front axle 
and electric motor at the rear axle), the 
amount of recuperative torque that can  
be applied decreases as the braking 
 deceleration increases. 

The electrical output of the battery has  
a major influence on the use of recupera-
tion, since it is the restrictive element for 
the uptake of electrical energy from vehi-
cle movement. As the output from the en-
ergy accumulator increases, the maximum 
possible recuperative braking decelera-
tion increases. However, for reasons of ve-
hicle stability, a large alternator braking 
torque can only be transmitted to the front 
axle. High levels of recuperative braking 
deceleration can therefore only be 
achieved with a vehicle possessing front-
wheel drive or all-wheel drive. In the latter 
case, the brake torque is distributed to 
both axles in such a way that it approxi-
mately corresponds to the ideal braking-
force distribution of the friction brake, 
 depending on the type of differential 
transmission.

Influences on stability control
Since the recuperative brake system af-
fects braking stability, ABS and ESP con-
trol systems must be adapted to the change 
in automotive physics.

The block diagram of the cooperative 
 recuperative brake system (Fig. 12) is 
something that all versions have in com-
mon. The vehicle control system continu-
ously monitors all relevant parameters  
of the hybrid drive and determines the 
torque that the electric motor can provide 
for braking. When the brake pedal is oper-
ated, the torque coordinator of the brake 
control unit calculates the distribution of 
the brake torque to the friction brake and 
the recuperative brake system. 

The proportion of recuperative torque  

is fed back to the vehicle control system 
and relayed to the electric motor actuator. 
The residual brake torque is set by the 
friction brake while vehicle stability and 
wheel slip are monitored.

If unstable driving conditions are detected 
or the amount of brake slip is excessive,  
it is advisable to suppress the recuperative 
part of the braking and only use the fric-
tion brake system for braking deceleration 
and stabilization corrections. Otherwise 
instability and drivetrain oscillation could 
have a detrimental effect on the wheel slip 
control system.

Compared to partial braking operations, 
brake stabilization system interventions 
via the vehicle systems occur so infre-
quently that suppressing recuperative 
braking in these situations has no notice-
able effect on the average consumption  
of the vehicle.

Friction brake implementation
There are different types of friction brake 
in the cooperative recuperative brake sys-
tem. 

These are usually mechatronic brake 
systems that decouple the brake pedal and 
the wheel brake and simulate brake pedal 
characteristics by adding a pedal simula-
tor. The energy storage that is needed for 
brake boosting can be provided hydrauli-
cally or pneumatically.

Vehicle electrical systems of hybrid 
 systems
Irrespective of the design of the hybrid 
 vehicle (serial, parallel or split-power hy-
brid), the vehicle electrical system consists 
of at least two subsystems with different 
voltage conditions:
 ▶ The traction power supply for supplying 

the electrical part of the drivetrain;  
the nominal voltage is significantly 
above 42 V in this case, whereby the 
 battery voltage can be less than the 
 traction power supply voltage 

 ▶ The conventional 12 V vehicle electrical 
system for supplying the body compo-
nents (power windows, radio etc.) and 
the internal-combustion engine (engine 
control unit, radiator fan, additional 
 water pump etc.)

 ▶ A sub-power supply with different 
 voltage conditions if necessary

Both the traction part and the body part of 
the vehicle electrical system are equipped 
with an energy accumulator. A facility for 
connecting the voltage levels using a  
DC/DC converter is usually provided.

The provision of a power supply net-
work with different voltage conditions  
and the way in which it is connected to  
the other sub-power supplies depends  
on the design of the respective hybrid 
 vehicle.

In order to ensure that the battery oper-
ates reliably with a high voltage condition 
in a hybrid vehicle, a control unit (battery 
management system) is needed that moni-
tors the individual battery components 
and controls charging and discharging, 
thermal management and various safety 
functions.

Energy accumulator requirements for 
traction vehicle electrical systems in 
hybrid vehicles
Whereas lead-acid systems are used in the 
12V vehicle electrical systems of motor 
 vehicles for powering the starter motor, 
the ignition, the engine management sys-
tem and the chassis components, the trac-
tion vehicle electrical systems of hybrid 
vehicle require additional energy storage 
systems. The selection of suitable electro-
chemical systems depends on the specific 
requirements: 
 ▶ High steady-state voltage of the individ-

ual cells

 ▶ Good cold startability
 ▶ Operation at average charge levels with-
out affecting service life, SOC (State Of 
Charge) charge level approx. 60 %

 ▶ Good charging/discharging performance 

at average charge level

 ▶ High efficiency in charging and dis-

charging mode (recuperation, accelera-
tion) at all temperatures

 ▶ High cycle strength with as much energy 

throughput as possible

 ▶ Long traction battery service life (at 

least the same as the vehicle service life)

 ▶ Thermal management system
 ▶ Easy operation and diagnosis
 ▶ Good safety level during operation and 

in the event of accidents

 ▶ Preferential use of recyclable and non-

toxic materials

State of charge
The energy accumulator is operated at an 
average charge level in order to achieve 
good recuperation current absorption and 
good power output in order to assist accel-
eration. High charge levels provide high 
power output, and low charge levels make 
it possible to feed back large quantities of 
recuperated electrical energy.

Hybrid drives  |  Electrical energy accumulators  |  381

The traction battery of plug-in hybrids is 
fully charged from the mains power supply 
at regular intervals. The vehicle is oper-
ated with electricity up to a preselected 
average charge level, after which it is oper-
ated like other hybrid vehicles.

Thermal management
The acceleration and recuperation phases 
alternate during vehicle operation. Even  
at high charge/discharge efficiency levels, 
this leads to heat losses that cause the bat-
tery to become warm. In order to remove 
the heat in a suitable way (air/liquid cool-
ing) the battery system must have a ther-
mal management system. 

Charge quantity
During battery system selection it must be 
taken into consideration that only a limited 
charge quantity can be used during the 
lifetime of the battery in cycle operation; 
this can occur in many flat cycles with 
small changes to the charge level, or  
fewer cycles with a large discharge depth 
(Fig. 13). The charge quantity that can be 
used tends to be less with low discharge 
cycles.

It must also be noted that the internal 
resistance of the battery increases with 
age, and performance deteriorates.

Lead (liquid)

Energy accumulator for hybrid systems
Nickel metal hydride batteries (NiMH)  
are currently used as standard for hybrid 
vehicles. Nickel cadmium batteries are  
not used in modern vehicles because of  
the fact that the cadmium material is toxic 
and damages the environment.

Lithium battery systems are undergoing 

further development for use in hybrid 
 vehicles. 

Nickel metal hydride systems (NiMH)
Nickel metal hydride batteries are particu-
larly useful for hybrid vehicles because 
designs with a high power density can be 
realized, given the materials that are used. 
The alkaline electrolyte (caustic potash 
 solution, KOH) does not take part in the 
electrode reaction (compared to lead/acid 
systems).

Also, operation in a partially charged 
condition does not adversely affect the 
service life. High efficiency levels with 
high charge/discharge currents can be 
achieved in other charge condition ranges.

The disadvantages of the NiMH system are 
the high self-discharge rate and extensive 
power loss at low temperatures. 

The relative low steady-state voltage  
of NiMH cells is also unfavorable. In order 
to achieve a battery voltage that is compa-
rable with lead systems, approximately  
1.6 times as many NiMH cells are required. 
In order to ensure that the entire battery 
system is reliable, the quality and unifor-
mity of the individual NiMH cells must be 
somewhat greater.

and 10 s pulse duration). Because of the 
high energy content of the electrode mate-
rial and the high cell voltage, special mea-
sures are required:
 ▶ Use of organic electrolyte with special 

conductive minerals 

 ▶ Safety structures that prevent the cell 

from exploding if it becomes damaged, 
for example

 ▶ Monitoring of individual cells in order to 

avoid overcharging and overheating

The positive electrode consists of special 
metal oxides (Ni, Mn, Co or mixtures 
thereof) that can store lithium ions. These 
ions can move to the counter-electrode 
and back during the discharging/charging 
process in a reversible mechanism. The 
counter-electrode is made from graphite 
and can also absorb Li ions because of its 
stratified structure. 

Lithium-polymer batteries
A special version of the Li ion battery is 
the Li polymer battery. It contains electro-
lytes in non-liquid form This version is 
particularly suitable for manufacturing 
 pliable, flexible cells. It is currently being 
investigated whether Li polymer batteries 
can be used in hybrid vehicles. 

382  |  Hybrid drives  |  Electrical energy accumulators

tions. During operation, it must be ensured 
that excessive overcharging does not occur 
and that ventilation facilities are provided. 
Clouds of caustic alkali can be expected 

to occur when the overpressure is being 
released. The fact that hydrogen can form 
oxyhydrogen gas when it is mixed with air 
must also be taken into consideration. 

Lithium ion systems (Li ions)
Compared to NiMH systems, lithium 
 systems provide even higher energy and 
power densities at cell voltages of approxi-
mately 3.6 V. These systems are therefore 
mainly used in portable electrical systems 
(mobile phones, laptops), where they have 
essentially replaced NiMH batteries.

Efforts are currently being made to sub-
ject these cells to further development for 
use in hybrid vehicles. Special attention is 
being paid to the use of low-cost and reli-
able electrode materials (e.g. LiMn2O4, 
LiFePO4).

The use of lightweight Li metal and the 
properties of the other materials involved 
(graphite as the anode material) make it 
possible to manufacture extremely thin 
electrodes (< 0.5 mm), which can be used 
to create structures with extremely high 
output (e.g. 3 kW/kg with SOC 60  %, 25  °C

Vehicle electrical systems

The vehicle electrical system of a motor 
vehicle comprises the alternator as the 
energy converter, one or more batteries 
as the energy accumulators and the elec-
trical equipment as consumers. The en-
ergy from the battery is supplied to the 
starter (consumer), which then starts the 
vehicle engine. During vehicle operation, 
the ignition and fuel-injection system, 
the control units, the safety and comfort 
and convenience electronics, the light-
ing, and other equipment have to be 
 supplied with power. 

Electrical energy supply 
in the passenger car 

When the engine is running, the alternator 
supplies electricity which, depending on 
the voltage level in the vehicle electrical 
system (determined by the alternator 
speed and the consumers drawing cur-
rent), is normally enough to power the 
consumers and charge the battery as well. 
If the consumer current draw IV in the ve-
hicle electrical system is greater than the 
alternator current IG (e.g. when the engine 
is idling), the battery is discharged. The 
vehicle system voltage falls to the voltage 
level of the battery from which current is 
drawn. If the consumer current draw IV is 
less than the alternator current output IG, 
a proportion of the current flows to the 

battery and acts as a battery charging 
 current IB. The vehicle system voltage 
 increases to the setpoint value specified  
by the voltage regulator.

With careful selection of the battery, 
 alternator, starter and the other electrical 
system consumers, it must be ensured that 
the charge balance of the battery is indeed 
balanced so that: 
 ▶ It is always possible for the internal-
combustion engine to be started 

 ▶ It allows operation of specific electrical 
consumers for a reasonable period of 
time when the engine is off

The lowest temperature at which the en-
gine can be started depends on a number 
of factors, including the battery (capacity, 
low-temperature test current, state of 
charge, internal resistance, etc.) and the 
starter (design, size, and performance).  
If the engine is started at a temperature  
of –20 °C, for example, the battery must 
have a given minimum state of charge p. 

Apart from the battery itself, the current 
output of the alternator and the power out-
put of the consumers have a decisive influ-
ence on the charge balance of the battery. 

Current output of the alternator

speed-dependent. For an engine idling

speed of nL, the alternator can only supply 
some of its rated current if it has a con-
ventional turns ratio ranging from 1:2 to 
1:3 (crankshaft to alternator). By defini-
tion, the rated current is output at an 
 alternator speed of 6,000 rpm.

 ▶ The secondary-air pump, which injects 
air immediately after the combustion 
chamber to burn the exhaust gas, runs 
for about 3 minutes after the engine is 
started 

 ▶ Other electrical consumers such as 

Power output of the consumers
The electrical consumers have a variety  
of switch-on durations. A distinction is 
made between continuous consumers 
 (ignition system, fuel injection, etc.), long-
time consumers (lighting, rear-window 
heating, etc.) and short-term consumers 
(turn signals, stop lamps, etc.). 

The use of a number of consumers is 
dependent on the time of year (air-condi-
tioning system, seat heating). The on-time 
of electrical radiator blowers depends on 
the ambient temperature and vehicle op-
eration. In winter, the vehicle is driven 
with the lights on most of the time. 

The electrical load requirements en-
countered during vehicle operation are 
not constant. The first minutes after 
startup are generally characterized by 
high demand, followed by a sharp drop  
in electrical load requirements: 
 ▶ A windshield heater requires up to  

2 kW for 1 to 3 minutes after the engine  
is started in order to de-ice the wind-
shield

heaters (rear window, seats, mirrors, 
etc.), fans and lights are switched on for 
longer or shorter periods depending on 
the situation, while the engine-manage-
ment system is in operation all the time 

Charging the battery
Due to the chemical processes that take 
place in the battery, the battery charge 
voltage has to be higher at low tempera-
tures and lower at high temperatures. The 
gassing voltage curve shows the maximum 
voltage at which the battery does not pro-
duce gas. A regulator limits the voltage if 
the alternator current IG is greater than 
the sum of the consumer equipment cur-
rent draw IV and the temperature-depen-
dent, maximum permissible battery 
charging current IB. Regulators are nor-
mally mounted on the alternator. If there  
is a significant deviations between the 
temperatures of the voltage regulator and 
the battery electrolyte, it is better to mon-
itor the voltage regulation temperature 
directly at the battery. The voltage drop 
across the alternator/battery charging cable 
can be accounted for by a regulator which

measures the actual value of the voltage at 
the battery. 

The arrangement of the alternator, 
 battery and consumers influences the 
 voltage drop on the charging cable and 
thus the charge voltage. The total current 
IG = IB + IV flows through the charging cable 
if all electrical consumers are connected 
to the battery. In response to the relatively 
high voltage drop, the charge voltage falls 
proportionately sharply. 

If all consumers are connected on the 

alternator side, the voltage drop is less 
and the charging voltage is higher. In the 
process, consumers that are sensitive to 
voltage peaks or voltage ripple (electronic 
circuits) may be damaged or suffer mal-
functions. Electrical consumers which fea-
ture a high power input and relative insen-
sitivity to overvoltage should therefore be 
connected close to the alternator, whereas 
voltage-sensitive consumers with a low 
power input should be connected close  
to the battery. 

Voltage drops can be minimized by suit-

able conductor cross-sections and good 
connections with low contact resistance, 
even after a long service life. 

Design of the vehicle electrical system
Dynamic system characteristic curve 
The dynamic system characteristic curve 
maps the relationship between battery 

voltage and battery current during a driv-
ing cycle. The envelopes reflect the inter-
relationships between the battery, alterna-
tor, consumers, temperature, engine 
speed, and engine/alternator speed ratio. 
A large area in the envelope means that, 
with this type of vehicle electrical system, 
significant voltage fluctuations are occur-
ring in the selected driving cycle and that 
the battery undergoes more powerful cy-
clization, i.e. its state of charge experi-
ences powerful temporal changes. The sys-
tem characteristic curve is specific to ev-
ery different combination and every set  
of operating conditions, and is therefore a 
dynamic curve. Measuring systems can be 
connected to the battery terminals to plot 
the dynamic system characteristic curve. 

Charge-balance calculation 
The charge-balance calculation is used as 
the basis for defining the design of the al-
ternator and battery. By means of a com-
puter program, the battery charge level is 
calculated from the consumer load and the 
alternator output power at the end of a 
specified driving cycle. Rush-hour driving 
(low engine speeds) combined with winter 
operation (low charging-current input to 
the battery) is regarded as a normal pas-
senger-car driving cycle. The battery must 
maintain a stable charge balance even un-
der these very unfavorable conditions for

the energy balance of the vehicle electrical 
system.

Driving profile
The driving profile as an input variable  
for the charge-balance calculation is rep-
resented by the cumulative-frequency 
curve of the engine speed. It describes 
how often a specific engine speed is 
reached or exceeded. 

In urban driving situations in rush-hour 
driving, a car’s engine is running at idle 
speed for a large part of the time due to  
the frequency of stops at traffic lights and 
consequently high traffic density. 

A city bus running on scheduled routes 
has a high idle percentage time due to 
 interruptions in driving at bus stops. 
 Another factor that has a negative effect  
on the battery’s charge balance is electrical 
consumers that are operated when the en-
gine is switched off. Long-distance buses 
generally spend only a small proportion  
of the time with the engine at idle speed, 
but on the other hand may have periods 
when consumers with a high power input 
are operated with the engine switched off.

Vehicle electrical system simulation
Contrary to the momentary view using a 
charge-balance calculation, model-based 

computer simulations can calculate elec-
trical system power supply status at any 
time during the trip. They can also include 
electrical system management systems  
and assess their effectiveness.

In addition to adjusting current levels  
in the battery, it is possible to record the 
vehicle-system voltage characteristic 
curve and the battery cycle at any time 
during a trip. Calculations performed us-
ing vehicle electrical system simulations 
are always useful when it comes to com-
paring electrical-system typologies and 
 assessing the effectiveness of consumers 
with a high dynamic response or only  
brief switch-on durations.

Fuel consumption 
Since one of the factors that affects the  
fuel consumption of a vehicle is its mass, 
the mass of the alternator is also an influ-
ence on consumption. 

Even the generation of power by the 
 alternator has an effect on fuel consump-
tion: the additional consumption at 100 W 
of generated electrical output is in the or-
der of 0.17 l per 100 km and depends on 
the efficiency of the alternator. For this 
reason, alternators with higher mid-range 
efficiency levels generally contribute to 
the engine’s fuel efficiency despite being 
slightly heavier in weight.

Electrical energy management 

An electrical energy management (EEM) 
system coordinates the interaction be-
tween alternator, voltage transformer, 
 batteries and electrical consumers when 
the vehicle is in use. When the vehicle is 
parked, the EEM monitors the batteries, 
and switches standstill-draw and constant-
draw consumers off as soon as the battery 
charge reaches a critical limit. The EEM 
regulates the entire electrical energy bal-
ance. It compares the power demand from 
the consumers with the power available 
within the vehicle electrical system and 
maintains a constant balance between 
 supply and power output. 

The basis for the EEM is the battery man-
agement. The objective of the battery man-
agement is to communicate to the EEM 
 information about the current state of the 
battery and about predicted electrical be-
havior. Using this information, it is possi-
ble to implement operating strategies for 
increasing vehicle availability and profit-
ability. 

The battery management communicates to 
the EEM the variables relevant to the bat-
tery, e.g. the state of charge (SOC), the state 
of health (SOH) and the state of function 
(SOF) of the battery. SOF is a prediction 
of how the battery would react to a pre-
defined load profile, e.g. whether a start-
ing operation would be successful with the 
current battery status.

These values are calculated using com-

plex, model-based algorithms from the 
measurement of battery current, voltage 
and temperature.

Using this battery data, the EEM is able to 
determine the optimal charge voltage and 
reduce the load on the electrical system 
(switch off consumers) in response to  
a  degrading state of function and/or 
 increase power generation (e.g. by in-
creasing the idling speed).

If the battery’s state of function falls 
 below a specified threshold value despite 
the measures that have been implemented, 
the EEM can warn the driver that certain 
functions (e.g. engine start) will not be 
available with the current battery status.

Battery status recognition
The control unit that makes battery status 
recognition (BSR) possible is the electronic 
battery sensor EBS (sometimes even EEM 
functions are implemented in this control 
unit). The sensor with integrated evalua-
tion electronics records the fundamental 
battery variables of voltage, current and 
temperature. From these variables, it uses 
complex software algorithms to calculate 
the variables that describe the status of  
the car battery. 

The electronic battery sensor comprises a 
chip, which contains the entire electronics, 
and a resistor element for current mea-
surement. Together with the terminal clip, 
both of these form a single assembly unit 
that can be connected directly to the car 
battery and fits into the terminal recess  
of conventional car batteries. 

 ▶ Assurance of startability (SOF) through 
compliance with defined limit values of 
the battery state of function and an in-
crease in vehicle availability

 ▶ Reductions in electrical load require-

ments and reductions in fuel consump-

with adaptation of alternator voltage
 ▶ Greater flexibility in the design of bat-
tery and alternator size by means of

 (optimal economic efficiency)

 ▶ Extension of battery life (e.g. through 
prevention of exhaustive discharge)

 ▶ Battery change indication

For stop/start applications, the following 
functions can also be fulfilled: 
 ▶ Prediction of startability after a defined 
stationary period (time, temperature, 
no-load current, power consumption 
during the stop phase) 

The following tasks of the electrical energy 
management are made possible by the use 
of battery status recognition:

 ▶ Assurance of a battery charge reserve  
in the stop phase (e.g. by switching off 
consumers)

Two-battery vehicle 
 electrical system

In the design of a vehicle battery, which 
supplies both the starter and the other 
consumers in the vehicle electrical system, 
a compromise has to be found between 
 different requirements. 

During the engine starting sequence, the 

battery is subjected to high current loads 
(300 to 500 A). The associated voltage 
drop has an adverse effect on certain elec-
trical consumers (e.g. units with microcon-
troller) and should be as low as possible. 
On the other hand, only comparatively low 
currents flow during vehicle operation;  
for a reliable power supply, the capacity of 
the battery is the decisive factor. Neither 
properties – rated output nor capacity – 
can be optimized simultaneously. 

In vehicle electrical systems with two 
batteries (starter battery and general-pur-
pose battery), the "high power for starting" 
and "general-purpose electrical supply" 
functions are separated by the electrical 
system control unit to make it possible to 
avoid the voltage drop during the start-
ing process, while ensuring reliable cold 
starts, even when the charge level of the 
general-purpose battery is low. 

Starter battery 
The starter battery must supply a high 
amount of current for only a limited period 
of time (during starting). It is therefore de-

9 Two-battery vehicle electrical system (schematic)

signed for a high power density (high power 
for low weight). Compact dimensions allow 
installation in the immediate vicinity of the 
starter motor with short connecting cables. 
The capacity is reduced. 

General-purpose battery 
This battery only supplies the vehicle elec-
trical system (excluding the starter). It pro-
vides currents for supplying the consumers 
of the vehicle electrical system (e.g.  approx. 
20 A for the engine-management system) 
but has a high cyclic capability, i.e. it can 
supply and store large amounts of power. 
Dimensioning is based essentially on the 
capacity reserves required for activated 
consumers, the consumers that operate 
with the engine switched off (e.g. no-load-
current consumers, parking lights, hazard 
warning flashers, immobilizer), and the 
minimum permissible charge level. 

Vehicle electrical system control unit
The vehicle electrical system control unit 
(EN ECU) in a two-battery vehicle electri-
cal system separates the starter battery 
and the starter from the rest of the vehicle 
electrical system provided this can be sup-
plied with sufficient power by the general-
purpose battery. It therefore prevents the 
voltage drop that occurs during starting, 
affecting the performance of the vehicle 
electrical system. When the vehicle is 
parked, it prevents the starter battery 
from becoming discharged by activated

consumers with the engine switched off 
and standstill-draw consumers.

By separation of the starting system 
from the remainder of the vehicle electri-
cal system, there are theoretically no limits 
for the voltage level within the starting 
system. Consequently, the charge voltage 
can be optimally adapted to the starter 
battery by a DC/DC converter to minimize 
the charging time. 

If there is no charge in the general-pur-

pose battery, the control unit is capable  
of provisionally connecting both vehicle 
electrical systems. This means that the 
 vehicle electrical system can be sustained 
using the fully-charged starter battery. In 
another possible configuration, the control 
unit for the starting operation would con-
nect only the start-related consumers to 
whichever battery was fully charged.

Vehicle electrical systems 
for commercial vehicles

Battery changeover 12/24 V
Various heavy commercial vehicles have a 
combined 12/24 V system, i.e. the supply 
voltage can be switched between 12 and 
24 V. In such cases, the alternator for volt-
age generation and the electrical compo-
nents (starter excepted) are designed for 
nominal 12 V operation. The starter has a 
nominal voltage of 24 V. It is therefore pos-
sible to achieve the power output required 
to start larger diesel engines, for example.

The system consists of two 12 V batteries 
that are connected in parallel during vehi-
cle operation and with the engine switched 
off. The voltage is no different with the 
parallel connection; the vehicle electrical 
system is supplied with 12 V. The total

 capacity of the two batteries is the sum of 
the individual  capacities. 

When the ignition switch is turned,  
a battery changeover relay automatically 
switches the two batteries in series so that 
24 V is applied across the starting-motor 
terminals during the cranking process. All 
other consumers are still supplied with 12 V.
As soon as the engine has started, that is 
when the ignition switch has been released 
and the starting motor switched off, the 
battery changeover relay automatically 
connects the batteries in parallel again. 
With the engine turning, the 12 V alterna-
tor recharges both batteries.

The capacities of two batteries connected 
in parallel should be equal to achieve 
 uniform current distribution during the 
charging and discharging process. From 
the wiring viewpoint, connections should 
also be as symmetrical as possible, with 
identical lengths of connection cable and 
conductor cross-sections.

Components in the vehicle electrical 
system 
At the present time, the components de-
scribed can also be used in passenger-car 
electrical systems. Here, however, they  
are not common and tend to be fitted as 
optional equipment.

Battery master switch
Generally, the vehicle’s electrical installa-
tion is wired such that when the key is 
pulled from the ignition switch the electri-
cal lines leading from the switch to, for 
 example, the ignition system, the control 
units (Motronic, ABS), the wipers, etc. are 
no longer supplied with current.

On the other hand, the lines leading to 
the ignition switch, to the starter, and to 
the light switch remain “live”. In other 
words there is still voltage on these lines, 
and if they have frayed or worn-through 
points these can lead to low resistances 
which can cause leakage currents or short 
circuits which  result in a discharged bat-
tery. The consequences are a discharged 
battery or the  possibility of a fire. A bat-
tery master switch makes it possible to 
completely isolate the battery from the 
 vehicle electrical system to eliminate the 
risk of these dangers.

The single-pole battery master switch  
is installed in the battery’s ground cable 
(negative terminal) as near to the battery 
as possible. It should be within convenient 
reach of the driver.

On installations equipped with three-

phase current alternators, due to the danger 
of voltage peaks (with the attendant destruc-
tion of electronic components), it is forbid-
den to operate the vehicle without the bat-

tery connected. On such installations there-
fore, the battery master switch may only be 
actuated with the engine at standstill. 

Battery relay 
Legislation stipulates that in buses, road 
tankers etc. a battery relay must be in-
stalled as the master switch to separate the 
vehicle electrical system from the battery. 
Not only short circuits are avoided (during 
repairs for instance), but also the decom-
position effects due to leakage currents  
on current-carrying components.

For this type of installation with three-
phase current alternator, in order to pre-
vent  excessive voltage peaks it is neces-
sary to fit a 2-pole electromagnetic battery 
main switch. This prevents the alternator 
being separated from the battery when the 
engine is running.

Battery-cutoff relay
The battery-cutoff relay (NO contact) sepa-
rates the starter battery from a second bat-
tery used for ancillary equipment. It pro-
tects the starter battery against discharge 
when the three-phase current alternator is 
not delivering charge current. This relay is 
provided with a diode for reverse-polarity 
protection, and a decay diode to suppress 
the inductive voltage peaks caused by 
switching.

Battery charging relay
The battery charging relay is needed when 
an additional 12V battery is to be charged in 
a 24 V vehicle system voltage. It is provided 
with resistors across which at 10 A charging 
current a voltage drop takes place which 
 reduces the charge voltage to 12 V. This of 
course necessitates the 24 V alternator be-
ing able to generate the additional 10 A.

Wiring harnesses

Requirements
The purpose of the wiring harness is to 
distribute power and signals within a mo-
tor vehicle. A wiring harness in the present 
day, mid-class passenger car with average 
equipment has approximately 750 differ-
ent lines, their length totaling around 
1,500 meters. In recent years the number 
of contact points has practically doubled 
due to the continuous rise in functions in 
the motor vehicle. A distinction is made 
between the engine compartment and 
body wiring harness. The latter is subject 
to less demanding temperature, vibration, 
media and tightness requirements.

Wiring harnesses have considerable 
 influence on the costs and quality of a 
 vehicle. The following points must be 
taken into consideration in wiring harness 
development: 

1 Wiring harness (example)

▶  Leak-tightness 
▶  EMC compatibility 
▶  Temperatures 
▶  Damage protection for the lines
▶  Line routing
▶  Ventilation of the wiring harness

It is therefore necessary to involve wiring 
harness experts as soon as in the system 
definition stage. Figure 1 shows a wiring 
harness that was developed as a special 
 intake-module wiring harness. Thanks to 
the optimization of routing and security  
in conjunction with engine and wiring 
 harness development, it was possible to 
achieve an advancement of quality as well 
as to yield cost and weight advantages.

Line cross-sections 
Line cross-sections are defined based  
on permissible voltage drops. The lower 
cross-section limit is determined by the 
line strength. Convention has it that no 
lines with a cross-section of less than 
0.5 mm2 are used. With additional mea-
sures (e.g. supports, protective tubes, 
 tension relief), even a cross-section of 
0.35 mm2 may be permissible.

Materials
Copper is usually used as the conductive 
material. The insulation materials for the 
lines are defined by the temperature to 
which they are exposed. It is necessary  
to use materials that are suitable for the 
high temperatures of continuous opera-
tion. Here, the ambient temperature must 
be taken into consideration as much as  
the heating caused by the flow of current. 
The materials used are thermoplastics  
(e.g. PE, PA, PVC), fluoropolymers (e.g. 
ETFE, FEP) and elastomers (e.g. CSM, SIR).
If the lines are not routed past particu-

larly hot parts (e.g. exhaust pipe) in the 
 engine topology, one of the criteria for the 
selection of the insulation material and the 
cable cross-section could be the derating 
curve of the contact with its associated 
line. The derating curve represents the 
 relationship between current, the temper-
ature increase that it causes, and the ambi-
ent temperature of the plug-in connection. 
Normally, the heat generated in the con-
tacts can only be carried away along the 
lines themselves. It should also be noted 
that the change in temperatures results  
in a change in the modulus of elasticity  
of the contact material (metal relaxation). 
It is possible to influence the relationships 
described by means of larger line cross-
sections and the use of suitable contact 
types and more noble surfaces (e.g. gold, 
silver) and thus higher limit temperatures. 
For highly fluctuating current intensities, 
it is often useful to measure the contact 
temperature.

Plug-in connections and contacts 
The type of plug-in connections and con-
tacts used depends on various factors:
▶  Current intensity 
▶  Ambient temperatures 
▶  Vibration load 
▶  Resistance to media and 
▶  Installation space 

Line routing and EMC measures
Lines should be routed in such a way  
as to prevent damage and line breaks.  
This is achieved by means of fasteners and 
supports. Vibration loads on contacts and 
plug-in connections are reduced by fasten-
ing the wiring harness as close to the plug 
as possible and at the same level as the vi-
bration where possible. The line routing 
must be determined in close cooperation 
with the engine and vehicle developers.

Where EMC problems arise, it is recom-
mended to route sensitive lines and lines 
with steep current flanks separately. 
Shielded lines are not straightforward  
to produce and are therefore expensive. 
They also need to be grounded. The twist-
ing of lines is a more cost-favorable and 
 effective measure.

Line protection
Lines need to be protected against chafing 
and against making contact with sharp 
edges and hot surfaces. Adhesive tapes  
are used for this purpose. The level of 
 protection is determined by the interval 
and winding density. Corrugated tubing 
(material savings from corrugation) with 
the necessary connecting pieces are  
often used as line protection. However, 
tape  fixing is still an essential means of 
preventing movement of individual lines 
inside the corrugated tube. Optimal pro-
tection is offered by cable ducts.

Plug-in connections

Design and requirements
The high integration density of electronics 
in the motor vehicle places high demands 
on a car’s plug-in connections. Not only do 
they carry high currents (e.g. activation of 
ignition coils), they also carry analog sig-
nal currents with low voltage and current 
intensity (e.g. signal voltage of the engine 
temperature sensor). Throughout the 
 service life of the vehicle, the plug-in con-
nections must ensure the reliable trans-
mission of signals between control units 
and to the sensors whilst maintaining 
 tolerances. 

The increasing demands of emission-

control legislation and active vehicle 
safety are forcing the ever more precise 
transmission of signals through the con-
tacts of the plug-in connections. A large 
number of parameters must be taken  
into consideration in the design, arrange-
ment and testing of the plug-in connec-
tions (Fig. 1).

The most common cause of failure of a 
plug-in connection is wearing of the con-
tact caused by vibrations or temperature 
change. The wear promotes oxidation. 
This results in an increase in ohmic 

 resistance – the contact may, for example, 
be subjected to thermal overload. The con-
tact part may be heated beyond the melt-
ing point of the copper alloy. In the case of 
highly resistant signal contacts, the vehicle 
controller often detects a plausibility error 
by comparison with other signals; the con-
troller then enters fault mode. These prob-
lem areas in the plug-in connection are di-
agnosed by the on-board diagnosis (OBD) 
required by emission-control legislation. 
However, it is difficult to diagnose the er-
ror in the service workshops because this 
defect is displayed as being a component 
failure. It is only possible to diagnose the 
faulty contact indirectly. 

For the assembly of the plug-in connec-
tion, there are various functional elements 
on the plug housing intended to ensure 
that the cables with their crimped contacts 
can be joined to the plug-in connection 
 reliably and defect-free. Modern plug-in 
connections have a joining force of < 100 N 
so that the assembly operative is able to 
reliably join the connector to the compo-
nent or control-unit interface. The risk  
of plug-in connections being connected  
to the interface incorrectly increases with 
higher connecting forces. The plug would 
come loose during vehicle operation.

Design and types
Plug-in connections have different areas of 
application (Table 1). These are character-
ized by the number of poles and ambient 
conditions. There are different classes of 
plug-in connection: hard engine attach-
ment, soft engine attachment, and body 
 attachment. Another difference is the 
 temperature class of the installation 
 location.

High-pin-count plug-in connections
High-pin-count plug-in connections are 
used for all control units in the vehicle. 
They differ in their number of poles and 
the geometry of the pins. Figure 2 shows  
a typical design of a high-pin-count plug-
in connection. The complete plug-in con-
nection is sealed at the connector strip of 
the respective control unit by means of a 
continuous radial seal in the plug housing. 
This, together with three sealing lips, 
 ensures a reliable seal against the control 
unit sealing collar.

The contacts are protected against the 
ingress of humidity along the cable by a 
seal plate, through which the contacts are 
inserted and the line crimped to them.  
A silica-gel mat or silica mat is used for 
this purpose. Larger contacts and lines  
may also be sealed using a single-core  
seal (see “Low-pin-count plug-in connec-
tions”).

When the plug is assembled, the contact 

with the line attached is inserted through 
the seal plate that is already in the plug. The 
contact slides home into its position in the 
contact carrier. The contact latches on its 
own by a locking spring that engages in an 
undercut in the plastic housing of the plug.

Once all contacts are in their final position, 
a slide pin is inserted to provide a second 
contact safeguard, or secondary lock. This 
is an additional security measure and in-
creases the retaining force of the contact 
in the plug-in connection. In addition, the 
sliding movement is a means of checking 
that the contacts are in the correct posi-
tion. The operating force of the plug-in 
connection is reduced by a lever and a 
slider mechanism.

Low-pin-count plug-in connections
Low-pin-count plug-in connections are  
used for actuators (e.g. fuel injectors) and 
sensors. Their design is similar in princi-
ple to that of a high-pin-count plug-in 
 connection (Fig. 3). The operating force  
of the plug-in connection is not usually 
supported.

The connection between a low-pin-
count plug contact system and the inter-
face is sealed with a radial seal. Inside  
the plastic housing, however, the lines  
are sealed with single-core seals secured 
to the contact.

Contact systems
Two-part contact systems are used in the 
motor vehicle. The inner part (Fig. 4) –  
the live part – is pressed from a high-qual-
ity copper alloy. It is protected by a steel 
overspring, which at the same time in-
creases the contact forces of the contact  
by means of an inwardly acting spring 
 element. A catch arm pressed out from the 
steel overspring engages the contact in the 
plastic housing part. Contacts are coated 
with tin, silver or gold, depending on re-
quirements. To improve the wear charac-
teristics of the contact point, not only are 
different contact coatings used but also 
different structural shapes. Different de-
coupling mechanisms are integrated into 
the contact part to decouple cable vibra-
tions from the contact point (e.g. meander-
ing routing of the supply lead).

The cables are crimped onto the contact. 
The crimp geometry on the contact must 
be adapted to the cable concerned. Pliers 
or fully automatic, process-monitored 
crimping presses with contact-specific 
tools are available for the crimping pro-
cess.

400  |  Starter batteries  |  Function and requirements

Starter batteries

The starter battery is an electrochemical 
storage facility for the excess electrical 
energy that is generated by the alterna-
tor while the engine is running. This 
stored energy is needed during vehicle 
operation in the phases when the energy 
required by the active consumers is 
greater than the energy that is generated 
by the alternator (e.g. at idle speed).  
The battery also provides the energy  
that is required by the electrical consum-
ers when the engine is stopped and for 
starting the engine. The battery can be 
recharged again when it has discharged. 
It is therefore a storage battery accumu-
lator, in this case a lead storage battery.

Function and requirements

The starter battery is the electrical energy 
storage facility in the vehicle electrical 
 system. It has the following tasks:
▶  Provide electrical energy for the starter 
▶  Compensate for the deficit between gen-
eration and consumption if the vehicle 
electrical system is not being supplied 
with an adequate amount of energy by 
the alternator (e.g. at idle speed or if the 
engine is stopped)

▶  Damping of voltage peaks from the 

 vehicle system voltage to protect sensi-
tive electronic and electrical compo-
nents (e.g. bulbs, semiconductors)

Starter batteries  |  Function and requirements  |  401

The starter is only switched on for a short 
time, but it has the highest power input of  
all electrical consumers (passenger cars with 
gasoline engines: 0.7 to 2.0 kW; passenger 
cars with diesel engines: 1.4 to 2.6 kW; 
 busses, commercial vehicles: 2.3 to 9.0 kW). 
The battery terminal voltage drops during 
starting because of the high current. It must 
not drop below a certain level so that the 
 operation of the various control units such 
as the engine management system is not af-
fected. These will not work if the supply 
voltage is too low.

A large number of electrical consumers 

must be supplied with energy when the 
 vehicle is being driven (e.g. the engine 
management system, the lighting system, 
the air-conditioning system, the electronic 
stability program). If the alternator does 
not generate enough power to supply every 
electrical consumer that is switched on  
(e.g. when idling or at low engine speeds), 
the vehicle system voltage drops to the bat-
tery voltage level and electrical energy is 
drawn from the battery. The battery must 
therefore be able to provide the vehicle 
electrical system  components with some of 
their power for a limited period or time or, 
if the engine and therefore the alternator is 
switched off, with all of their power. If an 
adequate amount of power is being gener-
ated, the battery can be recharged via the 
voltage regulator. The procedures that are 
described are known as the charging cycle 
and the discharging cycle.

The amount of power that is drawn from  

a starter battery varies considerably. The 
power requirements of the vehicle electrical 
system with the engine and the alternator 
stationary is approximately 10 to 50 mA  
(e.g. for the clock, the antitheft alarm system 
or the remote-controlled central locking 
system). When the engine is running at idle 
speed or the vehicle is being driven slowly, 
20 to 70 A is required from the battery at 
certain times. The engine starting proce-
dure requires about 300 A for a period of 
0.3 to 3 s, and peak currents of 1,000 A are 
even possible. The amount of power that is 

required and the time that is taken to start 
the engine are significantly greater at low 
temperatures (by up to a factor of 2). 

The power demand, which results from 
the electrical load requirements of a given 
vehicle, is determined in accordance with 
the vehicle operating conditions. It is deci-
sive not only for the dimensioning of the 
battery but also of the alternator.

If auxiliary equipment is chosen for the 

vehicle, this can lead to considerable in-
creases in power demand. Such equipment 
includes comfort and convenience systems 
with additional servomotors for power sun-
roof and power-window drives, seat and 
steering-column adjustment; as well as seat 
heating, air-conditioning system, cooler unit 
or similar. These electrical load require-
ments are taken into consideration in the 
 vehicle by the manufacturer when the 
 electrical components are dimensioned. 
This means that a vehicle equipped with 
such auxiliary equipment is delivered with  
a larger battery, and in some cases with a 
more powerful alternator. Other mechanical, 
cyclical, or climatic loadings are also taken 
into consideration depending upon the vehi-
cle’s application. For example, special vibra-
tion-proof batteries with a mat pressed be-
tween the plates are frequently used for all-
terrain commercial vehicles. AGM batteries, 
for example, are extremely suitable for spe-
cial cyclic loading. A corrosion-resistant 
lead alloy is required for warmer climates.
Caravans and mobile homes are often 
equipped with such electrical appliances as 
lighting, refrigerator, heating, radio and TV. 
Here, it is common to fit extra batteries with 
a separate electric circuit of their own.

Generally speaking, the lead-acid storage 
battery is sufficient for meeting these de-
mands, as well as at present still being the 
most cost-effective energy-storage medium 
for such assignments. Typical voltages are 
12 volts for passenger cars (with a 14-volt 
vehicle electrical system) and 24 volts for 
commercial vehicles (two 12-volt batteries 
connected in series).

402  |  Starter batteries  |  Design

Design

Classification
Starter batteries can be subdivided into 
two types:
▶  Closed batteries: 

These are EN 50 342 batteries with 
freely moving electrolytes in which any 
gas that builds up can escape through 
holes in the cover. The vast majority of 
all starter batteries are closed batteries.

▶  Sealed batteries: 

These EN 50 342 batteries only allow gas 
to escape if the pressure in the battery 
exceeds a certain value. The battery 
 cannot be topped up with sulfuric acid. 
The electrolyte is fixed, i.e. it is not free-
moving. This can be achieved by absorb-
ing the electrolyte in a glass fiber mat 
(AGM battery) or by using a gel electro-
lyte.

The following distinctions also exist: 
▶  Car batteries, the dimensions of which 
are defined as per the EN 60 095-2 stan-
dard and 

▶  Commercial vehicle batteries (mainly in 

accordance with EN 60 095-4)

With regard to maintenance, starter 
 batteries are categorized into 
▶  Conventional and low-maintenance 

 batteries

▶  Maintenance-free batteries (in accor-

dance with EN) and

▶  Completely maintenance-free batteries

The basic design of these batteries is es-
sentially the same, the main difference be-
tween them being the alloy from which the 
structural and discharge materials (grids) 
of the electrode plates are made. 

Components
A 12 V starter battery contains six series-
connected individually partitioned cells in 
a polypropylene case (Fig. 1). Each cell 

comprises a plate block consisting of a pos-
itive and negative plate set which are com-
posed of lead plates (lead grid and an active 
material), together with a microporous 
 insulating material (separators) between 
plates of opposite polarity. The electrolyte 
is in the form of diluted sulfuric acid which 
fills the pores in the plates and separators, 
and the voids in the cells. Terminals, cell 
connectors, and plate connectors are made 
of lead. The openings in the partitions for 
the cell connectors are sealed. A hot-mold-
ing process is employed to permanently 
bond the one-piece cover to the battery 
case thus providing the battery’s top seal. 
Each cell of a conventional battery has 

its own sealing plug that permits initial 
battery filling, topping-up during mainte-
nance and removes the gasses that occur 
during charging. Only maintenance-free 
batteries are installed in new vehicles 
nowadays because they do not require 
 regular checking of the electrolyte by  
the driver. They appear to be completely 
sealed. However, they contain ventilation 
openings so that the small amounts of gas 
that occur when the battery is charged by 
the alternator can escape.

Battery case
The battery case (Fig. 1, Item 8) – the hous-
ing of the battery – consists of acid-resis-
tant insulating material (polypropylene) 
and many versions have bottom rails (9)  
at the sides for securing the battery in the 
vehicle. 

The battery case is subdivided into cells 
by partitions. These cells are the basic ele-
ments of a battery. They contain the plate 
blocks (10, 11) with positive and negative 
plates, as well as the separators inserted 
between them. The cells are connected  
in series using cell connectors (3), which 
provide the connection through openings 
in the cell walls.

Starter batteries  |  Design  |  403

One-piece cover
The cells with the plate blocks are covered 
and sealed by a shared one-piece cover 
(Fig. 1, Item 1). The one-piece cover con-
sists of a cap and a basic cover (Fig. 2).

Plate blocks
The plate blocks consist of negative and 
positive plates (grid plates) connected in 
parallel, with intermediate separators  
(Fig. 1, Item 10 and Fig. 3). The capacity  
of the cells essentially depends on the 
number of plates and their surface area. 
The thickness of the plates is selected de-
pending on the battery application and is 
normally between 1 and 3 mm.

The plates (also known as grid plates) 
consist of lead grids and active material 
with which the grids are coated (pasted). 
The active material of the positive plate 
contains porous lead dioxide (PbO2, or-
ange-brown in color), and that of the nega-
tive plate contains pure lead in the form  
of “sponge lead” (Pb, gray-green in color). 
In other words, the pure lead is also in an 
extremely porous form. All negative and 
positive plates are connected via a plate 
strap (and/or plate connector), which is 
 located above the set of plates in the bat-
tery. This plate strap consists of solid lead. 
The plates and the plate strap are securely 
connected together in a melted joint.  

Each plate block usually has one negative 
plate more than it has positive plates.

Active material
The active material is that part of the  
grid plates that changes chemically when 
current flows, i.e. during the charging and 
discharging processes (see DIN 40 729). 
The material is porous and therefore forms 
a large effective inner surface area. For ex-
ample, the negative plates of a battery with 
100 Ah have an inner surface area of about 
2,000 m2, and the negative plates have ap-
proximately 30, 000 m2. During battery 
manufacture, the active material is pro-
duced by putting lead oxide (PbO) contain-
ing 5 to 15  % of finely distributed metallic 
lead (“gray oxide”) into a mixer with water 
(H2O), dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and pos-
sibly other additional materials and short 
synthetic fibers to form a dough-like paste. 
This produces basic lead sulfates. Some 
lead oxide and metallic lead is retained. 
The paste, which still has a dough-like 
consistency, is coated onto the lead grids 
and is left to harden.

The active material of the finished plate 

is created during subsequent forming,  
i.e. the electrochemical conversion of this 
material when the battery is charged for 
the first time, which all takes place at the 
battery manufacturer’s.

Separators
Since vehicle batteries have to be as small 
and light as possible the positive and nega-
tive plates are extremely close together, 
usually 0.8 to 1.5 mm apart. However,  
they must not come into contact with each 
other neither when they bend nor when 
particles crumble away from their surface. 
Otherwise the battery will be destroyed 
immediately by the resulting short-circuit. 
This is why batteries had ribs on the bot-
tom for fixing the plates until recently. 
Separating walls (Separators) were also 
 inserted between the individual plates  
in a plate block. 

The envelope-like separators (Fig. 4) in 
modern batteries ensure that plates with 
different polarity are an adequate distance 
apart and are electrically isolated (galvani-
cally isolated). The bottom ribs are there-
fore no longer needed. Porous polyethy-
lene foil which is resistant to the effects of 
oxidation and acid is used as the separator 
material. This is formed into envelopes 
which surround (and separate) the posi-
tive and negative plates in the plate block. 
The separators must not produce any sig-
nificant resistance to the migration of ions 
in the electrolyte (sulfuric acid). They must 
also consist of an acid-resistant but perme-
able (microporous) material so that they 
can be penetrated by the electrolyte.  

The microporous structure is also needed 
because fine lead fibers that could pene-
trate the separators would cause short cir-
cuiting and therefore have to be held back. 

Cell connectors
The individual battery cells are connected 
in series by the cell connectors (Fig. 1, Item 3 
and Fig. 3, Item 1). To decrease the battery’s 
internal resistance and weight, direct cell 
connectors are used in high-quality batter-
ies. The plate connectors of individual 
cells are connected by the shortest path, 
that is directly through the cell partition. 
This also reduces the danger of short-cir-
cuits due to external contact.

Terminal posts and battery-cable terminals
The plate connector of the positive plates 
in the first cell is connected to the positive 
terminal post of the battery, and the plate 
connector of the negative plates in the last 
cell is connected to the negative terminal 
post (Fig. 1, Item 5). The two terminal 
posts are the connecting links between  
the vehicle electrical system and the bat-
tery (Figs. 5 and 6) and consist of a lead 
 alloy. Their conical shape provides a firm 
seating and a good contact with the battery 
terminals. The terminal voltage is then 
available between these two battery 
 terminal posts (i.e. approx. 12 V).

The vehicle connecting cables are attached 
to the terminal posts by special battery 
terminals. To prevent one pole from being 
mistaken for the other (polarity reversal), 
the posts are specially marked and de-
signed differently (the positive post is 
thicker than the negative post). The bat-
tery terminals that are needed to connect 
the battery in the vehicle come in two 
 versions (Fig. 6):
▶  Screw-type terminals and
▶  Solder-type terminals

Designs
All batteries are described in standard lists 
which contain the electrical specifications 
and stipulations for the geometrical di-
mensions of the battery case and the ter-
minal posts (EN 60 095-2 for passenger 
cars). In addition, in order to ensure full 
interchangeability irrespective of manu-
facturer, details of mounting variants are 
given, as well as of the cell configuration 
and interconnection. When ordering 
 batteries from the Aftermarket Program,  
they are listed with these design variants 
as product features. The design variants 
are discussed in more detail in the follow-
ing chapters.

Electrical connections
Depending upon the available space and the 
equipment layout in the vehicle, a wide vari-
ety of batteries with different dimensions 
and terminal post configurations is required.
A wide range of battery dimensions is 
possible depending on cell arrangement 
(lengthwise or transverse installation) and 
interconnection design. An overview of 
the most common connection designs is 
given in Figure 7.

Battery covers
Passenger car batteries
Depending on the battery type there are 
two battery-cover versions for passenger 
car batteries (Figs. 8 and 9):
▶  One-piece cover and
▶  Mono cover

In one-piece covers with a gas passage,  
the gas that is given off during charging is 
led out of the battery centrally via a hose. 
One-piece covers have a sealing plug for 
each cell that can be removed for topping 
up with electrolyte and for maintenance 
purposes. Many maintenance-free batter-
ies no longer have sealing plugs.

The one-piece cover of a maintenance-free 
Bosch Silver battery has the following 
characteristics:
▶  Continuous, smooth cover surface 

▶  Handles for easy transportation (Fig. 11)
▶  Labyrinth for avoiding loss of water by 

(no plugs)

evaporation

▶  Frits (sintered microporous elements 

made from polyethylene) in the gas pas-
sage to prevent backfiring. This means 
that sparks or flames occurring in the 
immediate vicinity of the battery cannot 
reach the interior. 

▶  Labyrinth and frits to help prevent elec-

trolyte from escaping

The mono cover has neither a gas passage 
nor a labyrinth. The gas escapes through 
plugs with ventilation openings.

8 One-piece cover

Commercial vehicle batteries
There are two main types of commercial 
vehicle battery:
▶  Mono cover and
▶  Labyrinth cover

The gasses that occur during charging are 
removed via openings in the plug in mono 
covers. There are no frits. 

The labyrinth cover essentially has the 
 advantages of a passenger car one-piece 
cover, except for the fact that the labyrinth 
is lower down because of the external di-
mensions that are required for a commer-
cial vehicle battery. The advantages are 
 essentially the same:
▶  Frits to prevent backfiring
▶  Labyrinth to help prevent electrolyte 

from escaping and
▶  Central gas removal

Mounting
The battery must be mounted in the 
 vehicle so that it cannot move of its own 
accord. It is therefore clamped to a base 
using one of the following methods: 
▶  Clamping frame
▶  Bracket, each with clamping screw or
▶  Secured at the base with a clamping claw 

or clamping screw (Fig. 10)

The various forms of recess in the base  
of the battery case for the above forms of 
mounting are common, and are therefore

Reliable mounting is important for safety. 
Incorrectly mounted batteries can move  
in the event of minor accidents or even 
during sudden maneuvers and cause a  
fire due to short-circuiting.

The form of attachment provided com-
plies with all safety regulations and should 
therefore not be modified.

Operating principle

Electrochemical processes 
in the lead cell
Generation of the cell voltage
If a metal electrode (e.g. made from lead)  
is immersed in an electrolyte (e.g. sulfuric 
acid), metal ions are released into the elec-
trolyte. These metal ions are positively 
charged and leave electrons in the electrode.

The electrode therefore has electrical po-
tential. This counteracts the release of ad-
ditional ions, creating an equilibrium be-
tween the release and depositing of metal 
ions whilst absorbing electrons. 

A PbO2 electrode behaves in a similar 
way, except for the fact that a conversion 
of differently charged lead ions takes 
place (Pb2+ and Pb4+). Different electrodes 
have different potential, resulting in a cell 
voltage as a difference between these po-
tentials. In a charged lead cell (Fig. 12) the 
positive electrode essentially consists of 
lead oxide (PbO2), and the negative elec-
trode consists of pure lead (Pb). Dilute  
sulfuric acid is used as the electrolyte 
(H2SO4 plus H2O). The sulfuric-acid com-
ponent means that the pure water be-
comes conductive so that it can be used  
as an electrolyte.

The electricity is transported via ion 
conduction. In the water-based solution 
the sulfuric acid molecules split into posi-
tively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and 
negatively charged residual-acid ions (S4
The splitting is the prerequisite for the 
electrolyte’s conductivity and therefore for 
the flow of charge or discharge current. 
The particle transfers involved in the 
charge and discharge of the lead cell are 
described in the two paragraphs below  
in more detail.

2–). 

Charging a battery
The battery is charged while the vehicle is 
being driven, provided that the alternator 
is supplying enough charging current. A 
discharged battery can also be recharged 
using a battery charger. 

During the charging procedure, the pos-
itive electrode of the lead cell is connected 
to the positive terminal, and the negative 
electrode is connected to the negative 
 terminal of the DC source (alternator or 
battery charger). Unlike the discharging 
process that is described later, the charg-
ing process introduces electrical energy so 
that all cells achieve a higher energy level 
after charging. Figures 12 to 15 demon-
strate in schematic form the processes 
which take place between the individual 
particles in the electrode mass and the 
electrolyte.

The charging voltage source transports 
a charge from the positive electrode to the 
negative electrode in the cell. It forces the 
electrons of the negative electrode, which 
turns the bivalent positive lead (Pb2+) into 
“zero value” (metallic) lead (Pb) at this 
electrode by breaking up the lead sulfate 
molecules. At the same time, the negatively 
charged residual-acid ions (SO4
transferred from the negative electrode  
to the electrolyte (Fig. 12).

At the positive electrode, bivalent posi-
tive lead (Pb2+) is turned into tetravalent 
positive lead (Pb4+) due to the removal of 
electrons. The lead sulfate (PbSO4) is elec-
trochemically split by the applied charge 
voltage. The tetravalent positive lead com-
bines with the oxygen removed from the 
water (H2O) to form lead dioxide (PbO2). 
At the same time, the sulfate ions released 
at the positive electrode during this oxida-
2–, from the lead sulfate 
tion process (SO4
PbSO4) and hydrogen ions (H+, from the 
water) pass into the electrolyte. The reac-
tion equation of the charging procedure is: 

2PbSO4 + 2H2O → PbO2 + 2H2SO4 + Pb

The charging procedure increases the 
number of hydrogen ions (H+) and sulfate 
2–) in the electrolyte. This means 
ions (SO4
that sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is formed, 
whereby the density ρ of the electrolyte 
 increases (normally ρ = 1.28 kg/l for a 
charged cell). This corresponds to a 
 sulfuric acid content of approx. 37 %.  
This means that the state of charge of the 
battery can be determined by measuring 
the electrolyte density.

Charging is complete (Fig. 13), when
▶  The lead sulfate (PbSO4) has been con-
verted into lead dioxide (PbO2) at the 
positive electrode and 

▶  The lead sulfate (PbSO4) has been con-
verted into metallic lead (Pb) at the 
 negative electrode

▶  The charge voltage and the electrolyte 
density ρ no longer increase, even if 
charging continues

Gassing
The charging process causes the supplied 
electrical energy to be converted into 
chemical energy and stored. If charging 
continues after the battery has been fully 
charged, only electrolytic water decompo-
sition takes place. Oxygen forms at the 
positive plate (O2), and hydrogen (H2) 
forms at the negative plate. This procedure 

is known as gassing. Water may subse-
quently need to be added.

Overcharging can be reduced by re-
stricting the charging time, for example. 
Overcharging in the vehicle can be pre-
vented by means of charge status-con-
trolled charging, which requires some 
form of battery status detection, however.

Impact of engine speed
The battery charge largely depends on 
how the vehicle is driven (e.g. in traffic 
jams, stop-and-go, or without stopping). 
The alternator is driven by the engine, and 
the amount of current that is generated by 
the alternator increases together with the 
engine speed. Long waiting times in traffic 
jams and at traffic lights when the engine 
is only running at idle speed result in low 
alternator speeds and a low battery charge 
current. Short-distance driving has a nega-
tive effect on the battery’s charge balance. 
However, if longer distances are driven on 
a highway or interstate, the engine speed 
is in the medium to upper range and the 
battery charge current is accordingly high.

Discharge (current drain from the battery)
Compared to the battery-charging process, 
the direction of current flow and the elec-
trochemical process are reversed when 
discharge takes place. If a consumer (e.g. a 
lamp bulb) is connected between the poles

of a battery, due to the potential difference 
between the poles (6 times the cell voltage) 
electrons flow from the negative pole 
through the consumer to the positive pole. 
This electron transition causes the tet-
ravalent positive lead (Pb4+) of the positive 
electrode to be converted into bivalent 
positive lead (Pb2+), and the binding of 
the previously tetravalent lead at the oxy-
gen atoms (O) is canceled out (Fig. 14). 
The oxygen atoms that have been released 
combine with hydrogen atoms (H+) that 
have been taken from the sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and form water (H2O). The density 
of the electrolyte therefore drops. Depend-
ing on the type of battery, this is usually 
significantly below ρ = 1.12 kg/l. This cor-

15 Discharged cell

responds to a sulfuric acid content of ap-
prox. 17  %. 

At the negative electrode, bivalent posi-
tive lead also forms as a result of electrons 
moving from the metallic lead to the posi-
tive electrode (Pb2+). The bivalent nega-
tively charged sulfate ions (SO4
sulfuric acid combine with the bivalent 
positive lead at both electrodes so that 
lead sulfate (PbSO4) is formed as a dis-
charge product at each electrode (Fig. 15).

procedure is:

Both electrodes have now returned to their 
initial state: the chemical energy stored in

electrical energy by the discharge process.

Battery designs

Conventional and low-maintenance  
batteries
Conventional batteries are hardly ever 
 installed in new vehicles any more, since 
they are not maintenance-free and their 
fluid level has to be checked at regular in-
tervals. Since the gassing voltage (voltage 
at which the gassing process occurs) is 
lower than it is in any of the other popular 
battery versions, the gassing process starts 
sooner, and more charge gas escapes  
(see section entitled “Electrochemical pro-
cesses in the lead cell”). For this reason, 
water has to be added through the sealing 
plug at regular intervals.

Low-maintenance batteries are slightly 
better. Because of the low water consump-
tion (< 4 g/A ⋅ h), the maintenance intervals 
are longer, and they then depend on the 
type of vehicle use and the battery installa-
tion location.

Characteristics
Conventional batteries
Conventional batteries have ridges on  
the inner floor surface of the case, on 
which the plate feet rest. The spaces be-
tween the element rests, and below the 
bottom edges of the plates, form sediment 
chambers which serve to accumulate the 
solid material which, in the course of time, 
is sloughed off from the plates and falls  
to the bottom of the case. The sediment, 
which contains lead and is electrically 
 conductive, accumulates in the sediment 
chambers without contacting the plates. 
Short-circuits are thus avoided. The  
design with ridges and sediment chamber 
is needed in conventional batteries, since 
there are plate separators between the 
plates that do not surround them at the 
bottom.

Low-maintenance batteries
However, low-maintenance batteries use 
envelope-type separators. Because of their 
envelope shape they surround the positive 

or negative plate completely. Material par-
ticles that become detached drop to the 
bottom inside the envelope and can there-
fore not cause short circuiting. No ridges 
are therefore needed on the base of the 
battery – the bottom of the case is smooth. 
This means that the available plate surface 
can be increased (more current drain pos-
sible) and the plates rest on their entire 
underside (greater stability).

Plate grid alloy material
Lead-antimony alloy (PbSb)
In order to improve the casting capability 
of the thin lead grids (extremely important 
in high-performance starter batteries), 
 accelerate the hardening process and give 
the lead plates the stability that is required 
when driving (Deep-cycle resistance), the 
lead of the grid consists of a lead-antimony 
alloy (PbSb). In other words, the antimony 
acts as a hardener (this is where the term 
“hard lead” comes from). However, during 
the battery’s service life the antimony is in-
creasingly separated out due to positive-
grid corrosion. It migrates to the negative 
plate, passing through the electrolyte and 
the separators on the way, and “poisons”  
it by forming local voltaic couples. These 
local voltaic couples increase the self-dis-
charge of the negative plate and reduce 
the gassing voltage. Both cause increased 
water consumption when overcharging 
 occurs, which encourages the release of 
antimony. This self-energizing mechanism 
leads to a continuous drop in power 
throughout the battery’s service life.  
The reduced charging current leads to 
charging problems, particularly in winter. 
The battery does not achieve the required 
state of charge, and the electrolyte has to 
be checked at frequent intervals.

The self-discharging of the negative 
plates that is caused by the antimony con-
tent of 4 to 5  % in the grid lead is therefore 
one of the main causes of failure in con-
ventional starter batteries. Depending 
upon driving conditions, water consump-
tion (> 4 g/A ⋅ h) resulting from increased 

412  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery designs

gassing in older batteries used to mean the 
battery had to be checked every four to six 
weeks. The proportion of antimony in the 
positive plate is lower in low-maintenance 
batteries (< 3.5 %). This slows down the 
 increase in the self-discharging of the bat-
tery during the course of its service life.

Since batteries with lead-antimony alloy 

are extremely deep-cycle resistant, they 
are mainly used in commercial vehicles 
and taxis. Batteries for motorcycles are 
also based on antimony technology, since 
frequent use during good weather and 
long park-up times during winter require 
extremely deep-cycle resistant batteries.
However, the advantages of deep-cycle 
resistance are frequently counteracted by 
grid corrosion during service life. This is 
caused by the fact that grids with lead-
 antimony are subject to more corrosion 
than the lead-calcium alloy or the even 
better lead-calcium-silver alloy that are 
described below. 

However, since maintenance-free batteries 
and not extremely deep-cycle resistant 
batteries are required for the majority of 
passenger cars, antimony batteries are 
 seldom used in new vehicles. 

Maintenance-free battery (as per EN)
Plate grid alloy material
The negative grid of maintenance-free bat-
teries (hybrid batteries) consists of a lead-
calcium alloy (PbCa) – with added silver in 
some versions – and the positive grid is 
made from an antimony alloy (PbSb). 

Calcium takes over from antimony as the 

hardener for the negative plates. Calcium 
is electrochemically inactive under the po-
tential conditions that exist in lead storage 
batteries. This means that negative plate 
poisoning is avoided and self-discharging 
is prevented. However, what is more im-
portant is the high gassing voltage which is 
stable over the usage period, and the asso-
ciated water consumption, which is lower 
compared to lead-antimony alloy.

Another advantage of a hybrid battery is 
ease of manufacture. The negative grids 
with the calcium alloy can usually be man-
ufactured using a simple drawing process, 
and the positive grids, which are subjected 
to greater mechanical stresses through 
corrosion, are produced in antimony alloy 
using a more complicated casting process. 
However, due to the antimony content, 
hybrid batteries can seldom meet the high 
demand for low water consumption in pas-
senger cars (< 1 g/A ⋅ h). Only completely 
maintenance-free batteries, in which both 
positive and negative grids are made of a 
lead-calcium alloy, are capable of meeting 
these demands.

Under the high cyclical loading condi-

tions encountered in taxis in densely 
 populated areas, in town buses, and in 
 delivery vehicles, maintenance-free 
starter batteries have come to the fore-
front due to the advantages inherent in 
their separator concept (envelope-type 
separators) and the reliable protection 
against failure that they provide.

Characteristics
The water loss of a maintenance-free bat-
tery is lower over its entire service life 
than a conventional battery (< 4 g/A ⋅ h, 
usually < 2 g/A ⋅ h). The liquid level only 
needs to be checked during the normal 
service intervals in the workshop. Porous 
polyethylene foil which is resistant to the 
effects of oxidation and acid is used as the 
separator material. This is formed into 
 envelopes which surround (and separate) 
the positive and negative plates in the 
plate block.

Other features are:
▶  Labyrinth one-piece cover with central 
gas vent. This minimizes water con-
sumption caused by evaporation and 
prevents electrolyte from escaping if  
the battery is briefly tipped over.

▶  Frits provide protection from backfiring 
when sparks are present: this means 

Starter batteries  |  Battery designs  |  413

that they prevent escaping charge gas 
from being ignited by an external influ-
ence (naked flame) or igniting and flash-
ing back into the battery.

▶  The terminal posts are protected from 
 inadvertent short circuiting by caps.
▶  The cover plate over the plug trough 

covers the sealing plugs and prevents 
the accumulation of dirt and moisture.
▶  The bottom of the case is smooth on the 
inside because envelope-type separa-
tors are used. The plates reach down to 
the floor of the case (= increased plate 
surface) with which they are in contact 
along their complete length (increased 
stability).

▶  Microporous envelope-type separators 
prevent the loss of active material, as 
well as the formation of short circuits  
at the bottom and at the side edge of  
the plates. The mean pore diameter of 
the envelope-type separators is smaller 
than that of conventional plate separa-
tors by a factor of 10, thereby effectively 
preventing short-circuits as well as pro-
viding reduced electrical resistance.

Maintenance-free Bosch starter batteries 
comply with the minimum performance 
values stipulated by DIN, and also fulfill 
the following requirements:
▶  No impairment of performance data and 
charging characteristics as a result of 
water consumption.

▶  The performance data and charging 

characteristics remain consistent during 
the entire service life of the battery.
▶  After exhaustive discharge and a subse-
quent park-up period under vehicle 
electrical system conditions, the battery 
can be charged again.

▶  In case of seasonal operation without 

 intermediate charging (but with discon-
nected ground cable), no reduction in 
usable life is to be expected compared  
to all-year-round operation.

▶  The battery must be able to be stored for 

long periods after filling.

Completely maintenance-free battery
Completely maintenance-free batteries 
have a longer service life for extremely 
long distance driving and are more resis-
tant to continuous overcharging. This is 
achieved by means of a further develop-
ment of the plate alloy.

Plate grids
Lead-calcium-silver alloy (PbCaAg)
The higher performance of modern car 
 engines combined with more compact  
and streamlined body shapes has resulted 
in an increase in the average engine-com-
partment temperature. This change in 
 conditions also has an effect on the starter 
battery, as a result of which the most re-
cent development in battery design has 
seen the use of an improved lead alloy for 
the grids of the positive plates. In addition 
to having a lower calcium content and a 
higher tin content, they also contain a pro-
portion of silver (Ag). This lead-calcium-
silver alloy (PbCaAg) has a refined grid 
structure and has proven itself to be ex-
tremely durable, even under the influence 
of high temperatures that accelerate cor-
rosive decay. This is true when destructive 
overcharging occurs with high electrolyte 
density and also during (equally undesir-
able) periods of disuse with low electrolyte 
density. 

The alloy material for the negative plates 
is a lead-calcium alloy. These batteries are 
also antimony-free.

Characteristics
The optimized geometry of the grid struc-
ture with optimized electric conductivity 
 allows better use to be made of the active 
material. The connection (center tab) for 
the cell connector ensures that the grid 
plates inside the battery casing are uni-
formly fixed. This method provides the 
possibility of creating plates that are about 
30 % thinner (but more stable) than main-
tenance-free batteries and, as a result, 
of increasing their number. That makes it  
 
 

414  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery designs

possible to increase cold-starting power 
without sacrificing quality.

also provide protection against backfiring. 
Sealing plugs are no longer required. 

Versions with the “robust design” have 
shorter and thicker positive plates with a 
stable frame, meaning that a high volume 
of electrolyte is needed above the plates. 
Consequently, they are always covered 
by electrolyte and thus protected against 
 corrosion. These properties generally 
make this type of battery tougher in 
 practical applications.

The completely maintenance-free bat-

tery does not require electrolyte level 
monitoring and does not usually provide  
a facility for doing this. It is completely 
sealed apart from two ventilation open-
ings. As long as the vehicle electrical sys-
tem is operating normally (i.e. constant 
voltage limited to a maximum level),  
water decomposition is reduced to such  
an extent (< 1 g/A ⋅ h) that the electrolyte 
reserves above the plates will last for the 
entire service life of the battery. A com-
pletely maintenance-free battery also has 
the advantage of extremely low self-dis-
charging. This makes it possible to store 
the fully charged battery for several 
months after delivery.

Because of the low self-discharging,  
all completely maintenance-free batteries 
are filled with electrolyte in the manufac-
turing plant. This avoids dangerous spill-
ages in workshops or on dealer premises 
when mixing and adding electrolyte.
If a completely maintenance-free 
 battery is recharged outside the vehicle 
electrical system, the charge voltage must 
not exceed 2.3 to 2.4 volts per cell, since 
overcharging with constant current or 
 using chargers with a W characteristic 
(constant resistance) leads to water de-
composition (gassing).

The completely maintenance-free bat-

teries that are currently on the market 
have a safety labyrinth cover with side 
ventilation openings that prevent electro-
lyte from escaping if the battery is tilted  
at angles of up to 70° and, with the frits, 

The Bosch battery with silver alloy in the 
positive plates has a 20  % longer service 
life than conventional batteries. There are 
more plates per cell because the plates are 
thinner. The resulting greater surface area 
increases the starting power by 30 % in 
comparison with conventional batteries. 
This type of battery also has a “power con-
trol system” which is located in the battery 
cover and indicates the state of charge by 
displaying different colors.
▶  Green: state of charge is OK
▶  Dark gray: battery needs to be re-

charged. After recharging, the indicator 
changes back to “green”

▶  White: battery defective, must be 

 replaced

For applications in commercial vehicles 
there are Bosch batteries with silver alloy 
which offer the advantages of the com-
pletely maintenance-free, passenger car 
starter battery (“Bosch TECMAXX”).  
The complete freedom from maintenance 
that has cost benefits that should not be 
underestimated in the commercial vehicle 
area is combined with new battery cover 
technology: a new type of labyrinth cover 
prevents the electrolyte from escaping. 
The use of central degassing instead of 
 degassing via the plugs means that a frit 
can be installed, which prevents backfiring 
into the inside of the battery from external 
flames or sparks.

Completely maintenance-free batteries 
are used in almost all new vehicles nowa-
days. They make maintenance intervals 
longer and have proven themselves mil-
lions of times over.

AGM technology
AGM batteries (Absorbent Glass Mat, i.e. 
batteries with electrolyte bound in fiber-
glass mats) have proven themselves in 
cases where greater demands are made  
of the vehicle battery. These batteries dif-
fer from batteries with free electrolyte by 
the fact that the electrolyte is bound in a 
 fiberglass mat that is located between the 
positive and negative plates instead of 
 separators. 

The battery is separated from the envi-

ronment by valves (airtight). By means  
of internal circulation inside the battery, 
the oxygen that occurs at the positive elec-
trode due to gassing is used up again, the 
amount of hydrogen that is produced is 
suppressed and the amount of water loss  
is therefore minimized. This circulation is 
made possible because of the formation of 
small gas channels between the positive 
and negative plates, through which the ox-
ygen is transported. The valves only open 
in the event of considerable overpressure. 
The sealed AGM battery therefore has ex-
tremely low water loss and is therefore 
completely maintenance-free.

This technology also has other benefits. 
The mat is flexible, meaning that the plate 
set can be installed under pressure. Press-
ing the mat onto the plates reduces the 
shedding and separation effect of the ac-
tive material considerably. This produces  
a load throughput that is usually up to 
three times greater than that of compara-
ble starter batteries. This battery type also 
has the advantage that even if the battery 
case is destroyed as a result of an accident, 
for example, electrolyte does not usually 
escape, because it is bound in the fiber-
glass mat. No electrolyte escapes from the 
battery, even if it is turned 180 ° for long 
periods. High cold start currents are 
achieved because of the high porosity  
of the fiberglass mat. 

Another advantage of the AGM battery is 
that electrolyte stratification is prevented. 
When a battery with free electrolyte is be-

ing cyclically charged and discharged,  
an electrolyte density gradient gradually 
builds up from top to bottom. This is be-
cause when the battery is charged, electro-
lyte with a higher concentration occurs at 
the plates, drops to the bottom because  
of its greater specific density and collects 
there, whereas the electrolyte with lower 
concentration remains in the upper part  
of the battery cell. Among other things, 
this electrolyte stratification reduces both 
the battery capacity and the service life. 
The electrolyte stratification effect occurs 
to varying extents in all batteries with free 
electrolyte. In AGM batteries, however, 
electrolyte stratification is prevented by 
absorbing the electrolyte in fiberglass 
mats.

When an installation location is being 
chosen for an AGM battery it must be en-
sured that high temperatures are avoided, 
since the thermal capacity is lower than it 
is for a battery with free electrolyte.

Gel-electrolyte batteries
Another type of sealed and therefore com-
pletely maintenance-free battery uses a 
multi-component gel in which the electro-
lyte is incorporated, instead of fiberglass 
mats. Here too, the internal gas circuit 
 prevents gassing and therefore water con-
sumption. This means that this battery is 
also completely maintenance-free. 

The battery cell sealing plugs incorpo-
rate a safety valve that releases pressure  
in the event of continuous overcharging. 
These gel-electrolyte batteries only have  
a self-discharge rate of 2 % per month at 
20 °C. 

The short, thick plates and the gel elec-
trolyte also guarantee high deep-cycle re-
sistance. It is also completely sealed and 
completely spill-proof. This means that  
the electrolyte cannot escape, even if the 
battery is rotated 180°.

416  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery designs

Completely maintenance-free batteries 
for motorcycles
Leak-proof batteries with mat technology 
are becoming increasingly popular. These 
batteries do not use gel technology. The 
battery is filled at the required time from 
an electrolyte bottle which is included in 
the sale. After initial filling, the electrolyte 
is bound in mat-like separators. The gas 
circulation inside the battery prevents 
 gassing. If the battery is overcharged with 
high charge voltages over along period, 
gassing may occur in spite of the mat tech-
nology. In this case the gas escapes via a 
safety valve. After initial filling, the battery 
is sealed so that electrolyte cannot escape, 
even if the battery is tilted or rotated 180° 
for short periods.

Batteries for special applications
It is impossible to completely cover the 
wide range of different operating condi-
tions which can be encountered in the  
field with one single standard battery. 
Such a battery would be far too large for 
normal operation and far too expensive.

Batteries with additional starting power 

are required for extremely low tempera-
tures in cold countries. The starting tem-
peratures are often below –20 °C. These 
batteries feature an increased number  
of thinner plates and separators.

The situation in tropical climates is just 

the opposite, since there is a risk of elec-
trolyte “thickening” because of increased 
water consumption (electrolysis and 
 evaporation). In temperate and cold zones, 
there is no need to change the electrolyte’s 
density from its fully-charged freezing 
limit of –68 °C. In tropical regions, however, 
the electrolyte density must be reduced.

In the industrial and commercial sectors 

(bus, taxi, ambulance, delivery van, etc.), 
the fact that the vehicle is repeatedly 
driven only short distances means that  
the current taken from the battery is cor-
respondingly higher. In addition, there  
are further cyclical loadings during high 
power demands when the vehicle is sta-

tionary. These are caused by the air-condi-
tioning system, the lighting system, fans, 
electrohydraulically operated platform 
lifts, cooling units, auxiliary heaters etc.

As well as cyclical loading, batteries in 
all-terrain vehicles, commercial vehicles, 
construction machinery, towing vehicles 
and agricultural/forestry vehicles must  
be able to withstand severe vibration and 
impacts on slopes, construction sites or 
off-road conditions.

Deep-cycle resistant battery
Due to their design characteristics, starter 
batteries are poorly suited for applications 
in which frequent, extreme discharges 
 occur (so-called cyclic loading), since high 
rates of wear occur at the positive plates 
due to the separation and “shedding”  
(sedimentation) of the active material. In 
the commercial area (e.g. in commercial 
vehicles), the battery is subjected to ex-
tremely high loading because of the short 
distances traveled between engine starts, 
and the associated high power consump-
tion. Because of continuous power con-
sumption, the battery can become ex-
tremely discharged and may not be ade-
quately recharged by the alternator. 
Additional loading can also be caused by 
high power consumption whilst the vehicle 
is stationary by the fan, the air condition-
ing system, the auxiliary heater, the light-
ing system, the car radio, radio equipment, 
etc. In these cases, it is often advisable to 
use an AGM battery. If an AGM battery 
cannot be used, a deep-cycle resistant 
starter battery with free electrolyte is an 
alternative. It can be “deep”-discharged 
more often than a normal battery without 
impairing its service life. 

In the deep-cycle resistant starter bat-
tery, separators with additional fiberglass 
mats are used to give the positive material 
the extra support needed to prevent pre-
mature sludge formation. The service life 
of such a battery, measured in charge/dis-
charge cycles, is approximately double 
that of a standard battery. 

Starter batteries  |  Battery designs  |  417

Vibration-proof battery
In the vibration-proof battery, an anchor 
of cast resin and/or plastic prevents  
the plate blocks from moving inside the 
battery case. According to specified stan-
dards, this type of battery must withstand 
20 hours of sinusoidal vibration at a fre-
quency of 22 Hz and a maximum accelera-
tion of 6 g. Requirements are therefore 
about 10 times greater than for standard 
batteries. Vibration-proof batteries are in-
stalled primarily on commercial vehicles, 
construction machinery and tractors used 
on building sites, on ski slopes, and for  
off-road applications in agriculture,  
and forestry.

Heavy-duty battery
Commercial vehicles have a considerable 
number of additional electrical consumers 
such as a lift platform, radio equipment,  
a television or a coffee machine. The dry-
charged (i.e. the battery is ready for use 
 after filling with electrolyte) heavy duty 
battery (HD battery) is maintenance-free 
in accordance with EN and includes a com-
bination of measures for making the bat-
tery deep-cycle resistant and vibration-
proof. It ensures a reliable power supply 
even under conditions of high continuous 
loading caused by a large number of elec-
trical consumers. This type of battery is 
 installed in commercial vehicles which  
are subject to high levels of vibration and 
cyclical loading.

The HD-Extra battery features even more 
far-ranging characteristics. These are 
needed in order to withstand unusually 
high levels of loading:
▶  Extreme cold-start reliability (up to 

20  % higher starting reserve)

▶  Extremely long service life
▶  Extremely vibration-proof 

(100  % more than EN) 

▶  Extremely deep-cycle resistant (four 
times greater than standard batteries)

Battery for extended current output
This battery shares the basic design of the 
deep-cycle resistant version. However,  
it has thicker plates, though there are less 
of them. No low-temperature test current 
is specified for these batteries, since they 
are not suitable for starting. Their starting 
power is considerably lower (by approxi-
mately 35 to 40  %) than starter batteries  
of the same size.

These batteries are used in cases of 
heavy cyclic loading, sometimes even  
for traction purposes (drive battery).  
One  example of this type of use is in fork-
lift trucks, which do not need any starting 
power but have to be recharged at fre-
quent intervals. These batteries are also 
used to provide the drive energy for small 
drive units (e.g. in street sweepers and 
wheelchairs), and the energy for signaling 
systems, construction-site lighting, boats, 
ancillaries and for leisure time and hobby 
applications.

The proportion of antimony makes 
Bosch drive and lighting batteries with 
 liquid electrolyte particularly deep-cycle 
resistant. The negative effects of the anti-
mony are limited to a tolerable level. 

418  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery characteristics

Battery characteristics

The European standard EN 50 342 and na-
tional standards define the characteristics 
and test procedures for starter batteries. 
Although these tests are suitable for evalu-
ating and monitoring the quality of new 
starter batteries, they do not claim to fully 
represent the wide range of load demands 
which can be encountered in the field.

One of the characteristics of a chemical 
battery is that the amount of current that 
can be drained (capacity) depends on the 
magnitude of the discharge current IE. 
This means that the higher the current that 
is drained, the smaller the available capac-
ity at the defined cutoff voltage. In order  
to be able make a comparison between 
starter batteries at all, their capacity is re-
lated to the strength of discharge current 
which the battery can deliver during a dis-
charge time of 20 hours at a defined cutoff 
voltage (10.5 V) (nominal capacity K20).

Cell voltage
The cell voltage UZ is the difference be-
tween the potentials which are generated 
between the positive and negative plates  
in the electrolyte. These potentials depend 
on the plate materials and on the electro-
lyte and its concentration. The cell voltage 
is not a non-variable figure but depends on 

the state of charge (electrolyte density) 
and the electrolyte temperature.

Nominal voltage
The nominal voltage UN of a cell for lead stor-
age batteries has been defined by standards 
(DIN 40 729) to a value of 2 V. The nominal 
voltage of the complete battery results from 
multiplying the individual cell nominal volt-
ages by the number of cells connected in se-
ries. According to the EN 50 342 the nominal 
voltage for starter batteries is 12 V.

Open-circuit and steady-state voltage
The open-circuit voltage is the voltage across 
the unloaded battery. After completion of the 
charging and discharging processes, due to 
polarization and diffusion, it changes to be-
come a final value which is referred to as the 
steady-state voltage U0 (Fig. 16). The steady-
state voltage is the actual voltage obtained by 
multiplying the number of series-connected 
cells by the cell voltage UZ0. For six cells, 
the following applies:
U0 = UZ01 + UZ02 + ... + UZ06 ≈ 6 · UZ0

Similar to the cell voltage, the steady-state 
voltage is also dependent upon the state  
of charge and the electrolyte temperature.  
No conclusions can be drawn about the state 
of charge from a voltage that has been mea-
sured immediately after charging or dis-

charging procedures. It may take several 
days for a steady-state voltage to arise which 
can then be used to evaluate the state of 
charge. The electrolyte density is a more 
suitable indicator of the battery charge level. 

Internal resistance Ri
The internal resistance Ri of a cell is made 
up of a number of individual resistances. Es-
sentially these are the contact resistance Ri1 
between the electrodes and the electrolyte 
(polarization resistance). Then there is the 
resistance Ri2 of the electrodes (plates with 
separator) to the electrode flow and the re-
sistance Ri3 of the electrolyte to the ion cur-
rent. And when a number of cells are con-
nected in series, the resistances of the indi-
vidual cell connectors Ri4 must be added. 
This results in Ri = Ri1 + Ri2 + Ri3 + Ri4.

As the number of plates increases (greater 
surface area), the internal resistance of the 
cell decreases. In other words, the greater 
the capacity of a cell, the smaller the inter-
nal resistance (with the same plate thick-
ness). On the other hand, the more the bat-
tery discharges, and at low temperatures 
(sulfuric acid becomes more viscous), the 
internal resistance increases again Ri.
The internal resistance of a 12 volt 
starter battery comprises the series con-
nection of the internal resistances of the 
individual cells, together with the resis-
tances presented by the internal connect-
ing elements (cell connectors and plate 
connectors). The resistance for a fully 
charged 50-Ah battery at 20  °C is 5 to  
10 mΩ; with a charge status of 50  % and  
at –25  °C, it increases to about 25 mΩ. It is 
a characteristic variable for the starting 
 response. The internal resistance of the 
battery in combination with other sources 
of resistance in the starter-motor circuit 
determines the speed at which the engine 
is turned over when being started.

Terminal voltage UK
The terminal voltage UK is the voltage mea-
sured between the two terminal posts of a 

battery. It is dependent on the open-circuit 
voltage and the voltage drop Ui across the 
battery’s internal resistance Ri (Fig. 17):
UK = U0 – Ui  with Ui = IE · Ri 

If a discharge current IE is taken from a 
 battery by a consumer with a load resis-
tance of RL, a lower terminal voltage is 
 measured than in the no-load state. This 
is due to the battery’s internal resistance.  
If a current IE flows through the cells, a volt-
age drop UI takes place across Ri which in-
creases together with the current. Since in-
ternal resistance is a function of tempera-
ture and the state of charge (among other 
things), this means that a loaded battery’s 
terminal voltage drops at low temperatures 
and when it is inadequately charged.

Information about the state of charge 
and degree of wear of a battery that is un-
der load can be derived by measuring its 
terminal voltage.

Gassing voltage
The gassing voltage according to DIN 40 729 
is the charge voltage at which a battery starts 
to gas significantly. This will result in water 
loss from the battery and the risk of gas deto-
nation. According to DIN VDE 0510, a gas-
sing voltage of 2.40 to 2.45 volts per cell ap-
plies as a rough limit depending on the par-
ticular battery design. For 12 volt batteries, 
this voltage limit is therefore between 14.4 
and 14.7 volts, depending on the electrolyte 
temperature. In order to reduce water loss 
when driving and also ensure that rapid re-
charging is possible, temperature-dependent 
controller characteristic curves must be 
used. For completely maintenance-free bat-
teries these stipulate a maximum value of  
16 V at temperatures that are significantly 
lower than 0  °C and about 13.5 V at tempera-
tures that are significantly above 30  °C. 
This takes into consideration the fact that  
the charging capability of the lead storage 
battery is inhibited at low temperatures, 
which means that the charge voltage has to 
be  increased in this case. The charge voltage 
must be set to a lower level at high tempera-

420  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery characteristics

tures in order to restrict water loss and bat-
tery corrosion. The latter has a greater ef-
fect at high temperatures and high voltages.
A charge voltage of 14.1 V (2.35 V/cell) 
for a maximum charging time of 48 hours 
is specified for maintenance-free, sealed 
gel batteries.

Capacity
Available capacity K
The capacity K is the quantity of electricity 
which the battery can deliver under speci-
fied conditions. It is the product of current 
intensity and time (ampere hours Ah). The 
quantity of active material that is used and 
the quantity of electrolyte essentially deter-
mines the capacity of the battery. For high 
powers (such as are needed when starting 
an IC engine), the active material must have 
large internal and external surfaces (large 
number of large-area plates). The large in-
ternal surface area is produced during elec-
trochemical pretreatment known as “form-
ing”. However, the battery’s capacity is not 
a fixed parameter, but depends, among 
other things, on the following influencing 
variables (Figs. 18 and 19):
▶  Discharge current strength
▶  Density and temperature of the electro-

▶  Discharging process as a function of 

time (capacity is higher when a pause  
is made during discharge, than when 
discharge is continuous)

▶  Battery age (due to the loss of active 
 material from the plates, capacity 
 decreases as the battery approaches  
the end of its service life) and

▶  Degree of battery electrolyte stratifica-

lyte

tion

The discharge current strength is extremely 
important. The greater the discharge cur-
rent strength, the smaller the available ca-
pacity. In the example shown in Fig. 19, a 
discharge current of 2.2 amps means that 
the available 44 Ah capacity can be used for 
up to 20 hrs. With a mean starter current of 
150 amps at a temperature of 20  °C and a 

discharge time of approximately 8 minutes, 
the available capacity drops to approxi-
mately 20 Ah. The reason for this is that 
with a small discharge current, the electro-
chemical processes slowly penetrate deep 
into the pores of the plates and the electro-
lyte on the outside of the plates can also be 
used (approx. 50  %) , whereby the conver-
sion mainly takes place on the surface of  
the plates using the electrolyte that is in  
the pores when discharging takes place  
at a higher current.

Effect of temperature on capacity
The capacity and the discharge voltage of a 
battery increase together with the temper-
ature because of, among other things, the 
lower viscosity of the electrolyte and the 
lower internal resistance that this causes. 
However, as the temperature drops, they 
also reduce because the chemical pro-
cesses are then less efficient.

Therefore, when selecting a starter bat-

tery, the capacity should not be too low. 
Otherwise, with a wrongly dimensioned 
battery, there is the danger that at very low 
temperatures, an internal-combustion en-
gine will not be cranked fast enough and 
long enough to start it. This fact is demon-
strated in Figure 20:

 during the total discharge period:  
I20 = K20/20 h. 

The nominal capacity is a measure for 

the energy which can be stored by the 
 battery in the as-new condition. It depends 
on the quantity of active material and upon 
the electrolyte’s specific gravity. For in-
stance, a new 44 Ah battery can be dis-
charged at a current of 2.2 A for at least  
20 hours (44 Ah/20 h = 2.2 A) until the cut-
off voltage of 10.5 V is reached. The nomi-
nal capacity must be taken into consider-
ation in the design of the continuous con-
sumers in the vehicle electrical system  
of a motor vehicle (Fig. 19).

20 % discharged (curve 1b is for a heavily 
discharged battery). Curve 2 shows the min-
imum starting speed required by an inter-
nal-combustion engine. This engine speed 
is relatively high at low temperatures be-
cause of the high frictional resistance in the 
vehicle engine and the transmission (due to 
greater lube oil viscosity, for example).

The intersection S1 of curves 1a and 2 
shows the cold start limit (limit tempera-
ture) of the 20  % discharged battery. This 
means that starting is no longer possible  
at lower temperatures or with a lower bat-
tery charge because the output that can  
be produced by the battery and the starter 
is less than the starting power that is re-
quired by the internal-combustion engine. 
The more the battery is discharged, the 
more the cold-start limit (intersection S2) 
is shifted to higher temperatures.

Nominal capacity K20
The nominal capacity K20 is the battery’s 
rated electrical charge in ampere hours 
(Ah). According to EN 50 342, this is the 
electrical charge that can be taken from 
the battery within 20 h at a fixed discharge 
current of I20 until the specified cutoff 
voltage of 10.5 V at (25 ±2)  °C is reached. 
The discharge current I20 is the current 
that is allocated to the nominal  capacity, 
and must be delivered by the  battery

The low-temperature test current ICC (pre-
viously IKP) indicates the battery’s current 
output capability at low temperatures. Ac-
cording to EN 50 342, the battery terminal 
voltage at ICC and –18  °C and 10 seconds 
 after discharging has started, must be at 
least 7.5 V (1.25 V per cell). Other details 
relating to discharge period are specified 
in the standard. The determining factors  
of the short-term behavior indicated by ICC 
are the number of plates, the plate surface 
area, the plate spacing and the separator 
material. 

A variable that indicates the starting 

 response is the internal resistance Ri. 
For –18  °C and a full 12-V battery the fol-
lowing applies: Ri = 4,000/ICC , whereby ICC 
in amps must be used. The internal resis-
tance Ri is measured in the units mΩ.

The internal resistance of the battery  
in combination with other sources of resis-
tance in the starter-motor circuit deter-
mines the speed at which the engine is 
turned over when being started. However, 
the low-temperature test current is de-
fined according to a variety of different 
testing conditions in different countries  
so that it is not always possible to make  
a direct comparison of the cited figures.

For an automotive battery which must pro-
vide the electrical energy for the starter, 
startability at low temperatures is usually 
more important than the capacity. Since it 
refers to low-temperature current delivery, 
the low-temperature test current is there-
fore a measure for startability. It is ex-
tremely dependent on the total surface area 
(number of plates and plate area) of the 
 active material. The bigger the contact sur-
face there is between the lead material and 
the electrolyte, the greater the amount of 
current that can be drained in short bursts. 
Plate spacing and separator materials are 
important influencing variable which affect 
the rapidity of the chemical processes in 
the electrolyte and which also determine 
the low-temperature test current.

Type designations

The design specifications and designations 
of the various types of starter battery are 
defined by standards in order to make the 
products of different manufacturers inter-
changeable (compatibility). Bosch batter-
ies are generally labeled with the following 
information:
▶  Characteristics according to EN standard
▶  European type number (ETN) and gen-
eral safety instructions for handling 
 batteries

▶  Bosch part number (TTNR number)
▶  Customer search number KSN (specially 

for Bosch Silver)

Characteristic quantities
The battery characteristics defined by 
 European Standard EN 50 342 characterize 
the specifications/properties of a starter 
battery. The most important starter bat-
tery rating parameters are 
▶  Nominal voltage (e. g. 12 Volts),
▶  Nominal capacity (e. g. 44 Ah) and
▶  Low-temperature test current 

(e. g. 360 amps).

In the USA, a code such as an SAE (Society 
of Automotive Engineers) number, and in 
Japan, a JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) 
number is used.

European type number (ETN number)
The European type number (ETN) replaced 
the DIN number in Germany in 1998. It indi-
cates the voltage, capacity and low-tempera-
ture test current of the battery concerned. 
Example: 5 44 059 036

Code number for battery type:
The first digit of the ETN is a code number 
for the battery voltage (in the above exam-
ple, “5” for 12 V). The various code num-
bers used indicate the following:
1 to 4: 
5 to 7: 
8:  
9:  

6-Volt batteries
12-Volt batteries
Specialized batteries
Small traction batteries

Starter batteries  |  Practical and laboratory battery testing  |  423

Code number for battery capacity:
The second and third digits of the ETN 
are code numbers for the battery capacity 
(20 hours) in Ah (44 for 44 Ah in the above 
example). For capacities over 100 Ah, the 
first digit is increased by 1 for each 100 Ah 
(in the range 5 to 7).

Sequence number
The fourth, fifth and sixth digits of the  
ETN form a serial number (in the above 
 example 059). Various items of informa-
tion about the battery can be read off on 
the basis of this number using a list  
(e.g vibration resistance).

Code number for low-temperature  
test current:
The seventh, eighth and ninth digits of the 
ETN form a code number for the low-tem-
perature test current to EN. The figure 
represents one tenth of the current  
(in the above example, 036 for 360 A).

Bosch part number (TTNR number)
The alphanumeric Bosch part number 
(TTNR number) consists of a Bosch combi-
nation number for the battery type and a 
Bosch-coded ETN. 
Example: 0 093 S 544 1N

Code number for battery type:
The second and third digits of the TTNR 
number indicate whether the battery con-
tains antimony or not. 09 corresponds to 
antimony-free batteries and 18 corre-
sponds to batteries with antimony. 

Code number for voltage and capacity:
Digit 6 of the TTNR specifies the battery 
voltage, and digits 7 and 8 specify the ca-
pacity. Digits 1 to 3 have the same coding 
as the ETN.

Customer search number (KSN number)
For Bosch Silver batteries, there is a cus-
tomer search number (KSN) which makes 
it easier for customers to identify the cor-
rect battery for a particular vehicle model.

Practical and laboratory 
 battery testing

Various laboratory endurance tests are 
 described in EN 50 342. The standard  
also describes charge acceptance testing,  
water consumption testing and vibration 
resistance testing. Car manufacturers also 
frequently require other testing to be per-
formed. The charging and discharging 
 cycles of the battery are simulated at ex-
treme temperatures, followed by an engine 
start. One example is the J240 test, which 
is oriented to the American SAE standard. 
It tests the service life of a battery at high 
temperatures (75  °C). 

Useful life
Various claimed battery characteristics 
can be tested in the laboratory. However, 
the interaction of the battery characteris-
tics for achieving optimum usage in the ve-
hicle can only be tested in the field. Batter-
ies are therefore tested in driving mode. 
One example is the taxi test in Las Vegas. 
Special demands are made of the battery 
in Las Vegas. High temperatures occur be-
cause of the climate, and the battery is also 
subjected to high cyclic loading due to the 
nature of taxi driving. The usage time of 
lead-calcium batteries is 1.4 times longer 
than conventional batteries, and 3 times 
longer for lead-calcium-silver alloy.

Self-discharge
The self-discharge of the positive and 
 negative plates is inherent in the principle 
of the lead storage battery. The effects of 
temperature and other factors lead to the 
battery becoming electrically “empty” 
 after a given period of time. Considering 
conventional starter batteries, antimony 
poisoning leads to an increase of the self-
discharge reaction at the negative plates, 
and the rate of discharge climbs consider-
ably along with increasing battery age. In 
the field, this means that after a six-month 
storage period at room temperature, new, 
conventional-type starter batteries only 

424  |  Starter batteries  |  Practical and laboratory battery testing

have a state of charge of approximately 
65  %. This corresponds to an electrolyte 
density of 1.20 kg/l. Under certain circum-
stances, old batteries drop to this value 
within a few weeks. The state of charge of 
maintenance-free starter batteries after 
six months is 90  %. The corresponding 
electrolyte density is 1.26 kg/l. It takes 
18 months for the state of charge to reach 
65  % (electrolyte density ρ = 1.20 kg/l) 
(Fig. 22).

Because the lead-calcium grids have  
a purer alloy system, completely mainte-
nance-free batteries discharge at a consid-
erably slower rate. The low self-discharge 
rate of the positive plate and negative 
plate remains constant during the entire 
usage period. The self-discharge phenom-
enon is of particular significance for vehi-
cles used only during specific seasons 
 (agriculture, forestry, and construction 
sites). It is also important, however, for 
second cars and mobile homes which are 
not driven in winter, or only rarely. It also 
applies to new vehicles which, since there 
is no stop in production, are manufactured 
but have to be parked for long periods due 
to seasonal fluctuations in sales trends or 
the transportation time to the salesroom 
(export vehicles).

Starting power
Completely maintenance-free starter bat-
teries with lead-calcium-silver technology 
have 30  % more starting power than con-
ventional batteries. Basically speaking, 
this is due to the envelope-type separators 
with their low specific resistance, and to 
the increase in plate surface due to the 
omission of the sediment chamber.

Furthermore, thanks to the lead-calcium 

alloy used for the plate grids, the mainte-
nance-free battery’s starting power re-
mains practically unchanged for years.  
It does not drop to below the setpoint value 
for new batteries until towards the end of 
its useful life. Whereas the completely 
maintenance-free starter battery is still 
above the setpoint value after 75 % of its 
useful life, the conventional battery drops 
far below this setpoint value considerably 
sooner (at approx. 40 % of useful life). In 
practice, it has already lost about a third  
of its original starting power after only 
75 % of its useful life (Fig. 23).

Current draw
Low-antimony and antimony-free batteries 
behave almost identically during the  
EN 50 342 current draw test. Completely 
maintenance-free starter batteries have 
major advantages when charging with regu-
lators that take the battery temperature

into consideration and can exceed the volt-
age of 14.5 V (higher gassing voltage, less 
water loss). In practice, the differences be-
tween the most commonly used regulator 
characteristic curves (see section “Battery/
gassing voltage characteristics”) are small, 
apart from the better current draw of main-
tenance-free batteries with lead-calcium al-
loy with a state of charge of less than 50  %. 
This is due to the phenomenon applying to 
every battery, namely the fact that the lower 
the temperature, the higher the charging 
voltage required for a given state of charge. 
Since its gassing curve is higher during 
charging, the completely maintenance-free 
battery stores the increased charging cur-
rent without losses due to gassing. In other 
words it achieves a higher state of charge 
and therefore provides more starting power.

Resistance to overcharge
Overcharge is a decisive factor with regard 
to battery life. It applies for instance to ve-
hicles which have very high annual mile-
ages, as well as to courier and agricultural 
vehicles, construction-site machinery,  
and long-distance haulage trucks. In such 
cases, the battery is fully charged, the en-
gine turns at high speed, and the alterna-
tor only supplies a few consumers. Under 
these circumstances, the charging current 
leads to overcharging, corrosion, and loos-
ening of the active material. In laboratory 
tests, when these conditions are simulated 
at an electrolyte temperature of 40 °C and  
a charge voltage of 14 or 16 V, the mainte-
nance-free starter battery has a consider-
ably longer service life than a battery con-
taining antimony.

Resistance to exhaustive discharge
To check the battery’s resistance to ex-
haustive discharge, lamps are used to dis-
charge it completely, after which it is left 
4 weeks in the short-circuit condition. The 
battery must then be recharged under ve-
hicle electrical system conditions. It must 
still be operational and it must only dis-
play certain specified reductions in perfor-

mance. For example, a loss of battery ca-
pacity that is smaller than a specified limit.

Water consumption
When they are new, starter batteries with 
and without antimony show a far lower 
 water consumption than the maximum  
6 g/Ah as stipulated by DIN. As a rule, 
the lead-calcium battery has a long-term 
figure of less than 1 g/Ah.

The fact that the gassing voltage remains 

at its high initial level throughout the bat-
tery’s complete useful life is responsible for 
the water-consumption figures for com-
pletely maintenance-free starter batteries 
being so favorable. High gassing voltage 
leads to minimum water decomposition.

This confines the electrolyte checks to
▶  Every 15 months or 25,000 km for all 

low-maintenance batteries, and

▶  Every 25 months or 40,000 km for com-
pletely maintenance-free batteries  
(as per EN)

Summary
Completely maintenance-free batteries 
have the following benefits.
▶  The charge voltage only exceeds the 

 gassing voltage at high temperatures. 
This means that gassing rarely occurs, 
meaning that topping up with distilled 
water is unnecessary throughout the 
battery’s useful life. 

▶  Maintenance errors such as forgetting to 
top up with distilled water or filling with 
contaminated water cannot occur.
▶  The risk of skin contact with sulfuric 
acid and the damage that this causes  
is avoided.

▶  Longer service life and durability.
▶  Consistently high starting power.
▶  Better short-distance driving perfor-

mance.

▶  Better performance capability in all 

 temperature ranges.

▶  Cheaper maintenance and care.
▶  Possibility of locating the battery in 

 areas that are difficult to access in the 
vehicle.

426  |  History of the battery

▶ History of the battery

When considering the history of the battery, 

a number of renowned scientists and inven-

tors deserve particular credit. Above all,  

such personalities as Luigi Galvani (1789), 

Alessandro Graf Volta (around 1800), Johan 

Ritter (around 1800), Gaston Planté (1859) 

and Camille Faure were decisive in driving  

on the development of the battery.

Battery maintenance

Maintenance and care of batteries
Batteries are usually filled in the as-deliv-
ered condition, i.e. initial filling with elec-
trolyte is no longer required. Filling may 
only be needed for certain battery types 
such as motor cycle batteries and commer-
cial vehicle batteries. In these cases, the 
operating instructions must be followed. 
In many cases, maintenance is not lon-

ger needed, and may even no longer be 
possible, e.g. for maintenance-free batter-
ies such as the Bosch Silver. These batter-
ies lose so little water that topping up with 
distilled water is not required.

Batteries that do not require mainte-
nance can be detected by the fact that the 
battery plugs are no longer accessible.

Electrolyte density and state of charge
The electrolyte density is the major indica-
tor for the battery’s state of charge. Table 1 
shows a number of density figures and the 
associated freezing thresholds at different 
states of charge.

Electrolyte density and operating 
 temperature
High temperatures have the effect of accel-
erating chemical processes in the battery. 
However, the increase in temperature not 
only increases the capacity and starting 
system power, it also has a greater nega-
tive effect on the plates (active material 
falls away and grid corrosion occurs).  
The self-discharge rate is also accelerated.

Electrolyte density and freezing point
The more the battery is discharged, the 
more the electrolyte is diluted. This leads 
to the freezing point rising to more unfa-
vorable temperatures. The electrolyte in  
a fully charged battery with a specific den-
sity of 1.28 kg/l has a freezing point of 
–60 to –68  °C. However, a discharged bat-
tery with a specific density of 1.04 kg/l 
has a freezing point of –3 to –11  °C and can 
freeze when outside temperatures are low 
(see Table 1). 

A battery with frozen electrolyte can 
only deliver a very low current and cannot 
be used for starting. A polypropylene bat-
tery case remains stable even with frozen 
electrolyte. Since the fluid does not fully 
crystallize out, it is unlikely that the hous-
ing will fracture. A frozen battery is not to 
be charged because the frozen electrolyte 
then starts to swell. The battery must first 
thaw out before it can be recharged.

Measuring the electrolyte density
The electrolyte density is seldom mea-
sured in workshops because maintenance-
free batteries are used in the majority of 
vehicles. A battery syringe is occasionally 
used to check the electrolyte density of 
conventional batteries. This is used to 
draw electrolyte up into the glass tube. 
The hydrometer (a float with a scale) mea-
sures the density of the electrolyte and the 
measurement can be read off the scale. 

Modern acid refractometers use the re-
fraction of the electrolyte to determine the 
density. Just a small drop of electrolyte is 
required to perform this measurement. 
This device can also be used to check the 
frost protection of the coolant and the 
washing system water. 

On conventional batteries, the electro-
lyte level should be regularly checked, and 
if necessary the battery topped-up with 
distilled water to the “Max” mark. Before 
the cold season starts, the state of charge 
should be checked by measuring the elec-
trolyte density. If this is below 1.20 kg/l, 
the battery should be recharged.

428  |  Starter batteries  |  Battery maintenance

The electrolyte density of maintenance-
free batteries cannot be measured, nor 
does the battery need to be topped up with 
distilled water. The Bosch Silver battery 
provides an indication of the electrolyte 
density and therefore the charge via the 
“Power Control System” (Fig. 1). If the 
indicator in the transparent window is 
green, the battery is adequately charged. 
If the indicator is dark, the electrolyte 
density and therefore the state of charge is 
too low and the battery needs recharging. 
If the window is light, the electrolyte has 
dropped below the minimum level and the 
battery must be replaced. 

Battery storage
The following storage times are specified 
for new batteries on the aftermarket:
▶  Unfilled: unlimited
▶  Filled, conventional: 3 (max. 6) months
▶  Filled, completely maintenance-free: 

18 months

If the battery is to be stored for longer 
 periods, it must be regularly recharged 
 following the normal charging procedure. 
Batteries must be stored in a cool and dry 
state and in a good state of charge. The 
older a battery gets, the less time it can be 
stored. As far as possible, the battery is to 
be trickle-charged with a very low current. 
If the battery is to remain in the vehicle

during the storage period, its ground cable 
is to be disconnected.

Battery charging
If it is impossible for the alternator to 
charge the battery adequately, a battery 
charger must be used. This applies when 
the battery has been out of use for a long 
time, or directly before it is removed from 
the vehicle and put into storage.

Charging methods
Normal charging
Generally speaking, normal charging takes 
place using a battery charge current of I10, 
which corresponds to 10 % of the battery’s 
nominal capacity: 

I10 = 0.1 · K20 · A/Ah. 

Depending upon the process used, the 
charging time can be up to 14 hours.

Boost charging
Boost charging can bring a discharged 
 intact battery back up to about 80 % of  
its nominal capacity so that it can handle 
loadings which are typical in automotive 
applications. A high charging current can 
be used without problems below the gas-
sing voltage – e.g. in the range of the numer-
ical value for the nominal capacity (relative 
 battery charge current I1 = K20 · A/Ah). 
Once the gassing voltage is reached, the 
boost charge must either be switched off  
or changed to normal charging.

The gassing voltage depends on the 
 design of the battery, its age and the elec-
trolyte temperature. If the charge voltage 
exceeds this value during charging, the 
battery starts to gas. This leads to water 
loss in the battery and the production of 
oxyhydrogen gas. Controlled chargers 
therefore restrict the charge to a typical 
14.4 V (2.4 V/cell) with a cold battery and 
13.8 V (2.3 V/cell) with a warm battery.

Trickle charging
To compensate for the self-discharge 
losses in stored batteries (for instance 
when caravan or mobile-home batteries 
are stored during the winter), the battery 
is left connected to a battery charger for  
an extended period of time, whereby 
charging current is limited to 1 mA/Ah.

Floating-mode operation
With floating-mode operation, the battery 
charger and the consumers are perma-
nently connected to the battery. This 
means that energy is drawn from the 
 battery by consumers during charging. 
The electronics of the charger prevent  
the battery from becoming overcharged.

Charging characteristics
There are various methods for charging 
the battery, each of which is characterized 
by its own charging characteristics  
(DIN 41 722):

current drops when the charge 
 voltage increases)

With the W charging characteristic 
(Fig. 2a) the charging current is deter-
mined by the charge circuit resistance  
and the driving voltage difference accord-
ing to Ohm’s law (I = ΔU/R). Since the 
charge voltage slowly increases during 
charging, the driving voltage difference 
becomes smaller as does the battery 
charge current.

The W charging characteristic is easiest 
to achieve, i.e. it leads to cheaper chargers. 
However, the uncontrolled end of charging 
and the long charging time taken to fully 
charge the battery are a disadvantage.  
The battery charge current drops long be-
fore the gassing voltage has been reached.

Both disadvantages are avoided by using 

the IU charging characteristic (Fig. 2d).  
A constant high battery charge current I 
is maintained until the final charging volt-
age U is reached. This method permits 
a high level of charge in a short time 
whereby an overcharge is avoided. 

With the IUoU charging characteristic 
(Fig. 2e) the system U (2.3 to 2.4 V per cell) 
is permanently switched to a lower voltage 
(2.23 V per cell) when the final charge 
voltage is reached (trickle charge).

Battery overcharging is also prevented 
on equipment with a limited charge volt-
age (WU characteristic curve, Fig. 2c) or 
which automatically switches to weaker  
W charging characteristics when a limit 
stress is reached (Fig. 2b) or stops charg-
ing altogether (Wa characteristic curve).

The I1U1I2aI3aI3... charging characteristic 

(Fig. 2f) starts like IU charging. As soon as 
the battery charge current drops below a 
certain limit in the U-phase, the system 
switches to recharging with I2. This is for 
a limited time and with a limited voltage. 
Batteries with defined electrolyte (mat or 
gel technology) are fully charged, and nor-
mal starter batteries with free electrolyte 
(“wet” batteries) undergo a defined gassing 
phase with electrolyte mixing. The  final 
trickle charge (I3aI3a...) charges at  approx. 
1A/100 Ah until an upper limit stress is 
reached, and then shuts off. As soon as the 

battery voltage has reached a lower limit 
stress by means of self-discharging, the 
 recharging current I3 starts again.

Safety requirements
In order to avoid the risk of accidents the 
charger must have reliable potential sepa-
ration between the 230V mains and the ac-
cessible charging terminals. Additional re-
verse-polarity protection prevents battery 
short-circuiting and the destruction of the 
battery charger if the battery terminals are 
wrongly connected.

Battery testers
The condition of installed starter batteries 
can also be checked with battery testers. 
They mainly measure and evaluate the 
high-current capability of the battery.  
The Bosch BAT121 battery tester also 
makes it possible to print out the result of 
the test on the built-in thermal printer. 
The battery tester is connected to the 
battery via cables. The low-temperature 
test current of the battery is selected on 
the tester, then the test can be started.  
The digital display shows the following 
 information when the test is complete:
▶  The available starting power as a per-

centage of the input value

▶  The battery voltage
▶  The evaluation “good” or “replace”
▶  A charge recommendation if a low state 

of charge has been detected

Battery chargers
Highly sensitive electronic components 
such as airbags, car telephones, car radios 
and electronic control units must be pro-
tected from voltage peaks when the bat-
tery is being charged. Previously, the 
 battery had to be disconnected from the 
vehicle electrical system. However, when 
modern electronic chargers are being 
used, the battery can be charged with the 
consumers connected (floating-mode op-
eration). Since charging is faster and there 
is no danger to the vehicle’s electronic 
consumers, this is of course a considerable

▶  Electrical consumers (airbags, control

▶  No damage caused by erroneous opera-

tion

Electronic charger
Bosch electronic chargers supply an out-
put voltage that is free of damaging voltage 
peaks. Batteries can therefore be charged 
while they are installed in the vehicle. The 
equipment is protected from overcharging, 
overcurrents and polarity reversal. 
The BML2415 electronic charger 

charges the battery with a WU charging 
characteristic. The battery charge current 
is infinitely adjustable. The charger is suit-
able for trickle charging and floating-mode 
operation. Discharged batteries are 
charged at a lower current to begin with, 
then the current is increased.

The BAT415 electronic charger is suit-
able for charging conventional batteries 
and batteries with fixed electrolyte (gel 
battery or mat battery). This is made possi-
ble by the microprocessor-controlled 
I1U1I2aI3aI3... charging characteristic. 
The currents I1, I2 and I3 are optimally 
adapted to the battery by entering the 
 battery capacity in Ah. 

Rapid-start charger
The BSL2470 rapid-start charger BSL2470 
has enough power reserves to rapidly 
charge 12 V and 24 V batteries and provide 
mains-powered start assistance. Electrical 
components in the vehicle electrical sys-
tem are protected from damage during 
charging and starting. The battery charge 
current is infinitely adjustable, even deeply 
discharged batteries can be charged.

Important! Start assistance is only permit-
ted on vehicles for which the manufacturer 
has not imposed limitations or bans on 
start assistance in the operating instruc-
tions.

Start assistance with jumper cables
The battery from another vehicle can be 
used to provide start assistance. This pro-
cedure should only be used if the batteries 
are installed in both vehicles and the man-
ufacturer’s instructions are followed.  
For efficient starting assistance, only 
 standardized jumper cables (DIN 72 553) 
with a conductor cross section of at least 
16 mm2 must be used for petrol engines 
and 25 mm2 for diesel engines. Both of the 
batteries (or battery chargers) which are to 
be connected must have the same nominal 
voltage. The following operations are re-
quired:
▶  Determine the cause of battery dis-

charge. If the fault is in the electrical 
system, do not use start assistance since 
this can damage the battery charger, or 
the battery and alternator of the vehicle 
providing the assistance.

▶  Connect the positive terminal of the dis-
charged battery to the positive terminal 
of the external power source.

▶  Connect the negative terminal of the ex-
ternal power source to a bare metallic 
surface away from the battery (such as 
the engine ground strap) on the vehicle 
receiving assistance.

▶  Check that the battery jumper cables are 
firmly attached (good electrical contact).
▶  Start the vehicle with the sound battery. 
After a brief pause also start the dis-
abled vehicle.

▶  Once start assistance is complete, dis-

connect the cable clamps in the reverse 
order.

Malfunctions
Faults in the battery
Malfunctions caused by internal battery 
faults (such as short-circuits due to sepa-
rator wear or loss of active material, open 

circuit in cell or plate connectors) are 
 irreparable and the battery must be re-
placed. A cell short-circuit is recognizable 
from the battery voltage, which is too low 
by approx. 2 V. When an open circuit oc-
curs in the cell connectors, low currents 
can often be taken from the battery and it 
can also be charged, but even when fully 
charged, the voltage collapses when an 
 attempt is made to start the engine. 

Faults in the vehicle electrical system
If no battery defect can be found but the 
battery remains continuously overcharged 
(high water consumption, battery voltage 
permanently above 14.5 V with engine 
running) or is extremely discharged  
(no starting power, low electrolyte density 
in all cells, battery voltage less than ap-
prox. 12.3 V, battery voltage continuously 
less than approx. 13.9 V with engine run-
ning), there is a fault in the vehicle electri-
cal system. Reasons for faults may be de-
fects or malfunctions in the following 
 components:
▶  Alternator (permanent exhaustive dis-
charge, starting no longer possible)

▶  V-belt (missing alternator drive)
▶  Regulator (fluctuation in lamp bright-

ness when engine is accelerated, loss of 
battery water)

▶  Shutoff relay (consumers remain on 

when the engine has been switched off)

▶  Accessories (e.g. radio, clock, alarm 

 system) consuming excessive no-load 
current

In many cases it may be worth checking 
the alternator voltage if a battery fre-
quently shows a low state of charge.

Sulfation
If a battery is left discharged for a long 
 period, the fine crystalline lead sulfate that 
occurs when the battery is discharged may 
turn into large crystals under unfavorable 
circumstances. This is difficult or even im-
possible to revert. Such a battery is then 
described as “sulfated”. 

Starter batteries  |  Battery maintenance  |  433

is approximately equivalent to a steady-
state voltage of 12.3 V. Excessive water 
consumption, and/or charging immedi-
ately before the test will falsify the results 
in the direction of a more favorable ver-
dict. The charge on the surface of the 
plates that is falsifying the result can be 
 removed by brief discharging to the extent 
of 5  % of the nominal capacity. 

Safety instructions
Short-circuits (e.g. with the tool) can cre-
ate sparks and cause burning. For this rea-
son the earthing strap must be discon-
nected before starting work on the electri-
cal system or in the vicinity of the battery 
(after all consumers have been switched 
off). Particular care must be taken when 
connecting/disconnecting battery-charger 
cables or jumper cables in order to avoid  
a short-circuit. The following basic rules 
concerning safety must be followed when 
working with batteries:
▶  When handling sulfuric acid or when 
topping-up batteries which are not 
maintenance-free with distilled water, 
always wear protective goggles and 
 rubber gloves

▶  Do not fill up with electrolyte to above 

the MAX mark

▶  Do not tilt batteries to extreme angles 

from the vertical for long periods

▶  Due to the risk of electrolytic-gas deto-
nation, smoking and naked flames are 
not allowed and sparks must be avoided 
when batteries are being charged (con-
nect and disconnect cables in the pre-
scribed order with the battery charger 
switched off)

▶  Battery-charging rooms must be well 

ventilated

Sulfation is a result of careless mainte-
nance. It causes an increase in the bat-
tery’s internal resistance which impedes 
the chemical processes and makes charg-
ing more difficult.

A sulfated battery gets very hot when 
charged with a “W” charging characteris-
tic. The charge voltage rises sharply as 
soon as charging starts. If sulfation is only 
slight, the lead sulfate is broken down 
slowly and the charge voltage drops 
steadily. As soon as the lead sulfate has 
been broken down completely (regener-
ated), the voltage climbs again the same  
as it does when charging a serviceable, 
non-sulfated, battery (Fig. 4).

Troubleshooting
If the starter battery fails to start the en-
gine, this can be due to insufficient charge 
or to a battery defect. If a battery’s state  
of charge is less than 50  %, startability at 
very low temperatures (-20 °C) can no lon-
ger be taken for granted. The battery’s 
 exact state of charge can be determined by 
measuring the electrolyte density and also 
by precise measurement of the steady-
state voltage. This makes it extremely easy 
to differentiate between a poorly charged 
battery and a defective but properly 
charged battery. A state of charge of 50 %

434  |  Alternators  |  Electrical power generation in the vehicle

Alternators

Motor vehicles have an alternator to 
 generate electrical energy for supplying 
power to electrical consumers such as 
the starter, ignition and fuel-injection 
system and electronic control units, etc. 
The alternator also charges the battery  
if it generates more current than the con-
sumers need. Alternator output power, 
battery capacity and the power require-
ment of the electrical consumers must  
be matched to each other to ensure that 
sufficient current is supplied to the vehi-
cle electrical system in all operating con-
ditions and that the battery is always 
 adequately charged. 

Electrical power generation 
in the vehicle

Three-phase alternators
The availability of reasonably priced 
power diodes as from around 1963, paved 
the way for Bosch to start with the series 
production of three-phase alternators. 
Thanks to its greater capacity factor (ratio 
of energy generated to mass), higher effi-
ciency and wider engine-speed range in 
comparison to the direct-current genera-
tor, the three-phase synchronous genera-
tor is able to deliver power while the inter-
nal-combustion engine is idling and meet 
the increasing power requirements in the 
motor vehicle. At engine idle speed, a 
three-phase alternator already delivers  
at least a third of its rated output. As the 
battery and electrical consumers have to 
be supplied with direct current, the alter-
nating voltage generated by the three-
phase alternator is rectified. 

Since the alternator speed can be 

matched to that of the engine by means of 
a conversion ratio, this means that the bat-
tery remains at a high charge level even in 
unfavorable conditions (high proportion  
of idle phases, low outside temperatures). 
To be able to supply the battery and 
consumers with a constant voltage, the 
 alternator is equipped with a voltage 
 regulator. 

Three-phase alternators are designed for 
charge voltages of 14 V (for passenger 
cars) and 28 V (for commercial vehicles 
with a 24 V vehicle electrical system). 

Influencing variables
Engine speed
An alternator’s efficiency (energy gener-
ated per kg mass) increases with rotational 
speed. This factor dictates as high a con-
version ratio as possible between engine 
crankshaft and alternator. However,  
it must be ensured that the maximum 
 permissible speed of the alternator is  
not exceeded at maximum engine speed. 
For passenger cars, typical values for the 
turns ratio are between 1:2.2 and 1:3,  
and for commercial vehicles up to 1:5.

Temperature
The losses suffered in the conversion of 
mechanical energy to electrical energy 
cause the components of the alternator to 
heat up. A fresh-air supply or liquid cool-
ing are suitable measures for reducing 
component temperatures.

Vibrations and oscillations
Depending on installation conditions and 
the engine’s vibration patterns, the alter-
nator could be subjected to vibration ac-
celerations of between 500 and 800 m/s2. 
This places heavy loads on the mountings 
and the components of the alternator. 
 Critical natural frequencies inherent in  
the alternator design must be avoided. 

Other impacts
The alternator is also subjected to such 
detrimental influences as spray water,  
dirt, oil, fuel mist, and possibly road salt. 
The alternator must be suitably protected 
from corrosion to prevent leakage paths 
from forming between conducting parts.

voltage throughout the entire ranges  
of engine speed and load conditions
 ▶ Robust design capable of withstanding 
external stresses, such as vibration,  
high ambient temperatures, tempera-
ture cycles, dirt, moisture

Operating principle of  
the alternator

Electromagnetic induction
When an electric conductor moves relative 
to the lines of force of a magnetic field,  
a voltage is induced in the conductor. 
 According to Faraday’s law, the induced 
voltage Uind is greater the faster the 
speed v of vertical motion in relation 
to the lines of force and the greater the 
magnetic flux B through the conductor 
cross section:

→
→
 v  ×  
 B  |
Uind ~ |  

To generate an alternating current, a con-
ductor loop is turned between the north 
and south pole of a permanent magnet. 
With a uniform turning of the conductor 
loop, the curve of the induced voltage is 
 sinusoidal. The induced voltage can be 
tapped at the ends of the conductor loop 
using sliprings and carbon brushes. 
 Alternating current (AC) flows as soon  
as the circuit is closed (Fig. 1).

Excitation field
The magnetic field for inducing the voltage 
(excitation field) can be generated by per-
manent magnets. Due to their simplicity, 
these have the advantage of requiring only 
a minimum of technical outlay. They are 
used for small alternators (e.g. bicycle 
 dynamos).

Substantially higher, and at the same 
time controllable, currents can be gener-
ated if the excitation field is established by 
electromagnets. The electromagnet essen-
tially comprises a coil (excitation winding) 
through which an excitation current flows; 
the number of windings, together with  
the strength of the excitation current, 
 determines the magnetic field strength. 
The magnetic field can be amplified by 
means of a magnetizable iron core in  
the electromagnet. 

By changing the excitation current, it is 
possible to regulate the magnetic field and 
thus, too, the value of the induced voltage.
If an external source of energy (e.g. a 
battery) supplies the excitation current, 
this is known as external excitation. Self-
excitation is where the excitation current 
is tapped from the generated alternator 
current. 

Three-phase alternators
The fundamental components of an alter-
nator are the stationary stator (Fig. 2,  
Item 4) and the rotating rotor (5) inside it. 
Discussions up to this point have centered 
on an alternator with static excitation field 
and rotating armature winding in which 
the load current is generated. For automo-
tive three-phase alternators though, the 
winding system is in the stationary stator

(hence the term, stator winding). The poles 
of the magnet together with the excitation 
winding are now situated on the rotating 
part, the rotor. The rotor’s magnetic field 
builds up as soon as excitation current 
flows through the excitation winding.

Rectification of the alternating voltage
The alternating voltage generated by the 
alternator has to be rectified because the 
supply to the battery and the electronics  
in the vehicle electrical system requires 
 direct current. 

With the three-phase alternator, the arma-
ture contains three identical windings 
which are offset from each other by 120°. 
The start points of the three windings are 
usually designated u, v, w, and the end 
points x, y, z. Due to the 120° spatial offset 
between the windings, the sinusoidal alter-
nating voltages generated in them are  
also out-of-phase by 120 ° (time offset). 
The resulting alternating current is  
known as a three-phase current.

For unconnected windings, six electrical 

connections would be required for the 
 stator winding (Fig. 3a). The number of 
current lines is reduced to three by linking 
the three windings in a star connection 
(Fig. 3b) or in a delta connection (Fig. 3c).
In the case of the star connection, the 
ends of the 3-phase windings are joined  
to form a star point. Without a neutral 
 conductor, the sum of the 3 currents at  
any instant time is always 0.

Half-wave rectification
A rectifier diode only allows electric cur-
rent to pass in one direction and blocks it 
in the other. The negative half waves of the 
induced voltage are thus suppressed and 
only positive half waves are allowed to 
pass. The result is a gapped DC voltage 
(Fig. 4a) 

Full-wave rectification
Full-wave rectification (Fig. 4b) is used to 
exploit both the positive and negative half 
waves for current generation. This is also 
known as two-wave rectification. Due to 
the diodes with opposite bias at each of 
the two stator connections (3), the alter-
nating current has access to a conductive 
diode during the positive half wave and 
the negative half wave. The bridge circuit 
with four diodes transforms the alternat-
ing voltage into a pulse-controlled DC volt-
age (without gaps).

This means that the direct current (DC) 
which is taken from the alternator at 
 terminals B+ and B– to supply the vehicle 
electrical system is not smooth but has  
a slight ripple. This ripple is further 
smoothed by the battery, which is con-
nected in parallel to the alternator,  
and by any capacitors that may be  
present in the vehicle electrical system. 

Reverse-current block
The rectifier diodes in the alternator not 
only rectify the alternator and excitation 
voltage, but also prevent the battery dis-
charging through the 3-phase winding in 
the stator.

Rectification of a three-phase alternating 
voltage
The alternating voltages generated in the  
three windings of the three-phase alterna-
tor (Fig. 5) are rectified by six diodes in an 
3-phase bridge circuit. Two power diodes 
are connected to each phase winding, one 
diode to the positive side (positive diode 
to terminal B+) and one to the negative 
side (negative  diode to terminal B–).  
The positive half-waves pass through  
the positive-side diodes, and the negative 
half-waves through the negative-side di-
odes (Fig. 5b).

With full-wave rectification of the three 

phases using the B6 bridge circuit, the 
positive and negative half-wave envelopes 
are added to form a rectified alternator 
voltage with a slight ripple (Fig. 5).

With the engine stopped, or with it turning 
too slowly for self-excitation to take place 
(e.g. during cranking), without the diodes, 
battery current would flow through the 
stator winding. With respect to the battery 
voltage, the diodes are polarized in the 
 reverse direction so that it is impossible 
for battery-discharge current to flow. 
 Current flow can only travel from the 
 alternator to the battery.

Rectifier diodes
The positive and negative diodes are 
 completely identical in their operation. 
The knurled metal casing of the positive 
diodes acts as a cathode, the casing of the 
negative diode as an anode. The positive 
diodes are pressed into the positive heat 
sink that is conductively connected to the 

B+ battery terminal. As an anode, the metal 
casing of the negative diode pressed into 
the negative heat sink is conductively con-
nected to ground (B–). The diode wire ter-
minations are connected to the ends of the 
stator winding. Most power diodes in use 
today are Zener diodes (Z-diodes). These 
also serve to limit the voltage peaks which 
occur in the alternator due to extreme load 
changes (load-dump protection).

Generally, three-phase alternators are 

not provided with reverse-polarity pro-
tection. If battery polarity is reversed  
(e.g. when starting with the assistance  
of an external battery), this will destroy 
the alternator diodes as well as endanger 
the semiconductor components in other 
equipment.

The three-phase alternator’s circuits
Standard-version three-phase alternators 
have the  following three circuits:
 ▶ Preexcitation circuit (external excitation 

using battery current)

 ▶ Excitation circuit (self-excitation)
 ▶ Alternator circuit or main circuit

Preexcitation circuit for alternators 
with excitation diodes
Before self-excitation of the alternator can 
be initiated, a voltage must be induced in 
the stator that can drive the excitation cur-
rent. While the rotor does have some re-
sidual magnetism when de-energized, this 
is not sufficient for operation by self-exci-
tation. The alternator must therefore be 
excited independently at the start of oper-
ation. This is achieved by the preexcitation 
circuit, which is supplied by the battery. 
When the ignition or driving switch 

(Fig. 6, Item 4) is operated, the battery cur-
rent IB first of all flows through the alterna-
tor indicator lamp (3), through the excita-
tion winding in the rotor (1d), and through 
the voltage regulator (2) to ground. In the 

rotor, this battery current serves to pre-
 excite the alternator.

Self-excitation is initiated when the al-
ternator voltage is greater than the voltage 
drop at both diodes present in the excita-
tion circuit (one a conductive excitation 
 diode, the other a power negative diode: 
2 × 0.7 V = 1.4 V). The rotation speed at 
which self-excitation is initiated is the self-
excitation speed. It is above the 0-ampere 
speed. The 0-ampere speed is the speed  
at which the induced voltage of the self-ex-
cited alternator has exactly the same value 
as the vehicle system voltage, so the alter-
nator current is zero. Since the charge-
 indicator lamp increases the resistance in 
the preexcitation circuit in relation to that 
of the excitation circuit (with self-excita-
tion), a greater excitation current flows in 
self-excitation mode that induces a greater 
voltage (at the same speed) in the alterna-
tor stator. The output of the charge-indica-
tor lamp therefore influences the self-exci-
tation speed. Standard outputs of alterna-
tor indicator lamps are 2 W for 12 V 
systems and 3 W for 24 V systems.

Preexcitation with alternators 
with multifunction controller  
(alternators with excitation diodes)
When the multifunction controller (see 
“Voltage regulation” section) receives the 
“ignition ON” signal through the L connec-
tion, it switches on the preexcitation cur-
rent at the fixed on/off ratio (approx. 20 %, 
“controlled preexcitation”). When the ro-
tor starts to turn, the regulator registers a 
voltage at the phase connection V, whose 
frequency it uses to calculate the alterna-
tor speed. A cutting-in speed is set in the 
regulator, and as soon as this is reached, 
the regulator switches fully through the 
output stage (on/off ratio 100 %) so that 
the alternator starts to deliver current  
to the vehicle electrical system. 

Excitation circuit
During alternator operation, it is the task 
of the excitation current Ierr to generate a 
magnetic field in the excitation winding of 
the rotor so that the required alternator 
voltage can be induced in the stator wind-
ings. Since three-phase alternators are 
“self-excited”, the excitation current must 
be tapped off from the stator winding. 

Alternators with multifunctional control-
lers (without exciter diodes, see “Voltage 
regulation” section) draw their excitation 
current directly from terminal B+ (Fig. 8). 
The excitation current flows through the 
positive power diodes, multifunctional 
regulator, carbon brushes, sliprings,  
and excitation winding to ground (B–). 

Older versions of the alternator still have 
three excitation diodes at terminal D+, 
which, with the three negative diodes at 
terminal B-, form a B6 bridge circuit for 
rectifying the excitation current (Fig. 7). 
The excitation current flows through  
the excitation diodes, carbon brushes, 
sliprings, and excitation winding to ter-
minal DF of the regulator, and from ter-
minal D– of the regulator to ground (B–). 
In both cases, the excitation current 
flows from B– back to the stator winding 
through the negative power diodes.

Warning displays
If the alternator indicator lamp fails to go 
out even at high speeds, there is a fault in 
the alternator itself, at the regulator, in the 
wiring, or at the V-belt. By installing an

must be  rectified by the power diodes in 
the bridge circuit before it is passed on to 
the battery and to the consumers.

The alternator current IG, flows from the 
three windings and through the respective 
power diodes to the battery and to the 
consumers in the vehicle electrical system.  
In other words, the alternator current  
is divided into battery-charging current 
and consumer current. 

In Figure 10, the curves of the stator-
winding voltages are shown as a function 
of the angle of rotation of the rotor (in this 
example, a rotor with six pole pairs): with 
an angle of rotation of 30°, the voltage in 
relation to the star point at the end of 
winding v is positive, for winding w it is 
negative, and for winding u it is zero. The 
resulting current curve is shown in Fig-
ure 11: the current flows from the end of 
winding v and through the positive diodes 
to alternator terminal B+ from where it 
flows through the battery, or the consum-
ers, to ground (alternator terminal B–) and 
via the negative diodes to winding end w. 
At a 45° angle of rotation, current from  
the v and w winding ends takes the same 
path to winding end u. In this case, there  
is voltage present across all of the phases.

Voltage regulation

Purpose of voltage regulation
Presuming constant excitation current,  
the alternator voltage is dependent upon 
the alternator’s speed and loading. The 
regulator has the job of maintaining the 
 alternator voltage, and therefore also the 
vehicle system voltage, at a constant level 
across the engine’s complete speed range, 
independent of electrical load. To this end, 
the voltage regulator controls the level of 
excitation current and thus the size of the 
magnetic field in the rotor as a function  
of the voltage generated in the alternator. 
In this way, the regulator keeps the vehicle 
system voltage constant, protects voltage 
regulation and prevents the battery from 
being overcharged or discharged during 
vehicle operation. The voltage-regulation 
tolerance zone for vehicle electrical sys-
tems with 12 V battery voltage is around  
14 V, and for systems with 24 V battery 
voltage around 28 V. Whenever the voltage 
generated by the alternator is below the 
regulator response voltage, the voltage 
regulator remains switched off – the regula-
tor output stage is on (on/off ratio 100  %).

The voltage-regulator characteristics (al-
ternator voltage as a function of tempera-
ture) are matched to the battery’s chemical 
characteristics. At low temperatures, the 
alternator voltage is somewhat higher  
to improve battery charging in winter.  
The input voltages of the electronic equip-
ment are borne in mind here. At higher 
temperatures, on the other hand, alterna-
tor voltage is  reduced slightly in order to 
prevent battery overcharge and gassing in 
summer. Figure 12 shows an example of a 
characteristic. The voltage level is 14.5 V 
with a slope of - 10 mV/K (temperature 
compensation). 

Principle of voltage regulation
The regulator switches off the output stage 
if the voltage exceeds the upper setpoint 
value (Fig. 13). As a consequence of the 
 inductance of the field coil, the excitation 
current at first flows on through the free-
wheeling diode; excitation is weakened 
and, as a result, the alternator voltage falls. 
If the alternator voltage falls below the set-
point value in this scenario, the regulator 
switches the excitation current back on. 
Excitation increases as does the alternator 
voltage. When the voltage exceeds the 
specified upper value again, the control 
cycle is repeated. Since these control 
 cycles all take place within a matter of 
 milliseconds, the alternator mean voltage 
is regulated effectively in line with the de-
fined characteristic.

The relationship between switch-on and 

switch-off times is decisive for the magni-
tude of the resulting mean excitation cur-
rent. At low rotational speeds, the “On” 
time is relatively long and the “Off” time is 
short. The excitation current is interrupted 
only briefly and its mean value is high. On 
the other hand, at high rotational speeds 
the “On” time is short and the “Off” time 
long. Only a low excitation current flows.

When the regulator switches to the “Off” 
status, upon interruption of the excitation 
current a voltage peak is induced in the

 excitation winding due to self-induction. 
To prevent the occurrence of these voltage 
peaks, a free-wheeling diode is connected 
in the regulator parallel to the alternator’s 
excitation winding. As soon as the excita-
tion winding is interrupted, the free-
wheeling diode “takes over” the excitation 
current and permits it to decay. 

The three-phase alternators of today are 
equipped with electronic voltage regula-
tors as standard. By contrast, the electro-
magnetic regulator is in practice only ever 
used as a spare part.

Electromagnetic voltage regulators
The contact regulators used for three-
phase alternator applications are of the 
single-element type (Figs. 14 and 15).  
That is, regulators with a voltage-regulator 
element comprising an electromagnet (3), 
a regulating armature, and a regulating 
contact (4). Alternator current flows 
through the electromagnet and the elec-
tromagnet controls the regulating arma-
ture, which in turn closes or opens the 
 excitation circuit by means of a regulating 
contact.

Voltage is regulated in the following way 
with the single-element, single-contact 
regulator (Fig. 14): the regulating armature 
is acted on by the magnetic force of the 
electromagnet dependent on the alterna-
tor current on the one hand, and by the 
spring force of a suspension and adjust-
ment spring on the other. As soon as the 
alternator voltage exceeds the setpoint 
value, the electromagnet pulls in the arma-
ture and opens the contact (position b). 
This switches a resistor into the excitation 
circuit which reduces the excitation cur-
rent and with it the alternator voltage. If 
the alternator voltage falls below the set-
point value, the magnetic force is reduced 
again. The spring force prevails and closes 
the contact (position a). This opening and 
closing cycle is repeated continually.

The single-element double-contact regula-
tor (Fig. 15) operates with a second pair  
of contacts which permit 3 switching posi-
tions. The regulating resistor is short-cir-
cuited in position a and a high excitation 
current flows. In position b, the regulating 
resistor and the excitation winding are 
connected in series and the excitation

tation winding is short-circuited and the 
 excitation current drops to zero (the time 
constant is independent of the excitation 
winding’s inductance and reactance).

Electronic voltage regulators
Characteristics
Electronic voltage regulators are used 
solely with three-phase alternators. 
Thanks to its compact dimensions, its low 
weight, and the fact that it is insensitive to 
vibration and shock, this regulator can be 
integrated directly in the alternator.

Whereas the first transistor regulators 

were built from discrete components, 
modern-day versions all use hybrid and 
monolithic technology.

The transistor regulator’s essential ad-

vantages are:
 ▶ Shorter switching times which permit 

closer control tolerances
 ▶ Maintenance-free (no wear)
 ▶ High switching currents
 ▶ Spark-free switching, which causes  

no radio interference

 ▶ Insensitive to shock, vibration, and 

 climatic effects

 ▶ Temperature compensation 

 ▶ Compact construction allows direct 

mounting on the alternator, irrespective 
of alternator size

Method of operation
The operating concept is the same for all 
electronic-regulator types. An explanation 
is given here with the EE transistor regula-
tor as an example. 

The actual value of the alternator volt-
age between terminals D+ and D– is regis-
tered by a voltage divider (R1, R2, and R3). 
A Zener diode is switched in parallel with 
R3 and functions as the alternator’s set-
point generator. A partial voltage propor-
tional to the alternator voltage is perma-
nently applied to this diode.

The regulator remains in the “On” state as 
long as the actual alternator voltage is below 
the setpoint value (Fig. 16a). The Z-diode’s 
breakdown voltage has not yet been 
reached at this point, i.e. no current flows to 
the base of transistor T1 through the branch 
with the Z-diode. T1 is in the blocking state. 
With T1 blocked, a current flows from the 
exciter diodes via terminal D+ and resistor 
R6 to the base of transistor T2 and switches 
T2 on. Terminal DF is now connected to the 
base of T3 by the switched transistor T2.

This means that T3 always conducts when 
T2 is conductive. T2 and T3 are connected 
as a Darlington circuit and form the regula-
tor’s power stage. The excitation current Ierr 
flows through T3 and the excitation winding 
and increases during the “On” period, 
 causing a rise in the alternator voltage UG. 
At the same time, the voltage at the setpoint 
generator also rises. The regulator assumes 
the “Off” state as soon as the actual alterna-
tor voltage exceeds the setpoint value  
(Fig. 16b). 

The Z diode becomes conductive when the 
breakdown voltage is reached. A current 
flows from D+ through the resistors R1, R2 
and into the current path containing the  
Z-diode to the base of transistor T1. Thus 
T1 also becomes conductive. As a result, 
the voltage at the base of T2 is practically 0 
in relation to the emitter, and transistors 
T2 and T3 (power stage) block. The excita-
tion circuit is open-circuited, the excita-
tion decays, and the alternator voltage  
falls as a result. As soon as the alternator 
voltage drops under the setpoint value,

and the Z diode switches to the blocked 
state, the power stage switches the excita-
tion current on. 

When the excitation current is interrupted, 
a voltage peak would be induced due to 
the excitation winding’s self-induction 
which could destroy transistors T2 and T3. 
To prevent this, the free-wheeling di-
ode D3 is connected in parallel to the alter-
nator’s excitation winding. Upon the exci-
tation winding being interrupted, the free-
wheeling diode “takes over” the excitation 
current and prevents the occurrence of 
voltage peaks.

The control cycle in which the current is 
switched on and off by connecting the ex-
citation winding alternately to the alterna-
tor voltage or short-circuiting it with the 
free-wheeling diode is repeated periodi-
cally. The on/off ratio depends on the 
 alternator speed and the applied load.

The ripple on the alternator DC voltage  
is smoothed by capacitor C. Resistor R7 
ensures the rapid, precise switch-over of 
transistors T2 and T3, as well as reducing 
the switching losses.

Hybrid regulators
The transistor regulator using hybrid tech-
nology comprises a hermetically encapsu-
lated case, in which are enclosed a ceramic 
substrate, protective thick-film resistors, 
and a bonded integrated circuit (IC) incor-
porating all the open- and closed-loop 
control functions.

The power components of the output 
stage (Darlington transistors and the free-
wheeling diode) are soldered directly onto 
the metal socket in order to ensure good 
heat dissipation. The electrical connec-
tions are via glass-insulated metal pins.

The regulator is mounted on a special 
brush holder and directly fastened to  
the alternator without wiring. Due to  
the Darlington circuit in the power stage 
(two transistors), there is a voltage drop of 
about 1.5 V in the current-flow direction.

Figure 17 shows the circuit diagram for an 
three-phase alternator with a hybrid volt-
age regulator. The hybrid regulator’s ad-
vantages can be summed up as follows: 
compact construction, low weight, few

conditions encountered in automotive ap-
plications. Normally, hybrid regulators 
 using conventional diodes are used with 
compact-diode-assembly alternators  
(see “Alternator versions” section).

Monolithic regulators
The monolithic regulator was developed 
from the hybrid regulator. The functions  
of the hybrid regulator’s IC (Integrated 
 Circuit), power stage, and free-wheeling 
 diode have been incorporated on a single 
chip. The compact construction with fewer 
components and connections enabled 
 reliability to be even further improved. 
Since the output stage is in the form of a 
simple power stage, the voltage drop in  
the current-flow direction is only 0.5 V.
Monolithic regulators in combination 

with rectifiers (with Zener diodes) are 
used in compact alternators.

Multifunction controller
Monolithic regulators can have a multitude 
of additional functions. These multifunc-
tion controllers are fitted in all new com-
pact alternators today. They draw excita-
tion current directly from B+, eliminating 
the need for excitation diodes.

Additional functions of the multifunc-
tion controller in comparison to conven-
tional regulators are: 
 ▶ Controlled preexcitation
 ▶ “Alternator turning” detection through 
monitoring of the phase connection
 ▶ Emergency regulation in the event of 
open circuit in the line at terminal L
 ▶ Over-temperature protection by means 
of a controlled reduction of excitation 
current if the limit temperature is 
 exceeded

 ▶ Load-response functions: slow, contin-
ued regulation of the excitation current 
after switching to the load of the vehicle 
electrical system so that the engine has 
enough time when idling to balance out 
the increasing drive torque of the alter-
nator.

The power loss associated with the alter-
nator indicator lamp in the instrument 
cluster is often excessive. It can be re-
duced by using an LED display instead,  
for example. Multifunctional voltage regu-
lators permit the triggering of lamp bulbs 
as well as of LED display elements in the 
instrument cluster.

Overvoltage protection

The starter battery’s low internal resis-
tance generally suppresses all the voltage 
peaks occurring in the vehicle electrical 
system.

Nevertheless, it is often advisable to 
 install overvoltage protection as a precau-
tionary measure against faults in the vehi-
cle electrical system on vehicles for the 
transport of hazardous materials.

Reasons for overvoltage
Overvoltage may occur in the vehicle elec-
trical system as the result of:
 ▶ Regulator failure
 ▶ Failed or disconnected battery
 ▶ Switching off of consumers with a 
 predominantly inductive load

 ▶ Loose connections

The overvoltages are voltage peaks that 
last a matter of milliseconds. The maxi-
mum voltage peaks are in the region of 
350 V. Overvoltages are also generated 
when the line between battery and alterna-
tor is open-circuited with the engine run-
ning (this happens when an outside bat-
tery is used as a starting aid), or when 
high-power consumers are switched off. 
For this reason, under normal driving 
 conditions, the alternator is not to be  
run without the battery connected.

Under certain circumstances though, 
short-term or emergency operation with-
out battery is permissible. This applies to 
the following situations:

Alternators  |  Overvoltage protection  |  449

 ▶ Driving of new vehicles from the final 

assembly line to the parking lot

 ▶ Loading onto train or ship (the battery  
is installed shortly before the vehicle is 
delivered to the customer)

 ▶ Service work, etc.

With towing vehicles and agricultural trac-
tors it is also not always possible to avoid 
operation without the battery connected.

Types of protection
Overvoltage protection can be achieved by 
various measures.

Protection by Zener diodes (Z diodes)
Z diodes can be used in place of the recti-
fier power diodes. They limit high-energy 
voltage peaks. 

Furthermore, Z diodes function as a cen-
tral overvoltage protection for the remain-
ing voltage-sensitive consumers in the 
 vehicle electrical system. The limiting volt-
age of a rectifier equipped with Z diodes is 
25 to 30 V for an alternator voltage of 14 V, 
and 50 to 55 V for an alternator voltage of 
28 V. Compact three-phase alternators are 
always equipped with Z diodes.

Surge-proof alternators and regulators
The semiconductor components in surge-
proof alternators have a higher electric-
strength rating. For an alternator voltage 
of 14-V, the electric strength of the semi-
conductors is at least 200 V, and for a  
28-V alternator voltage it is 350 V.

In addition, a capacitor is fitted between 

the alternator’s B+ terminal and ground 
which serves for intensified interference 
suppression. 

The surge-proof characteristics of such 

alternators and regulators only protect 
these units, they provide no protection for 
other electrical equipment in the vehicle.

Overvoltage-protection devices
(only for 28 V alternators)
These are semiconductor devices which 
are connected to the alternator terminals 
D+ and D– (ground). In the event of voltage 
peaks, the alternator is short-circuited 
through its excitation winding. Primarily, 
overvoltage-protection devices protect  
the alternator and the regulator, and to a 
lesser degree the voltage-sensitive compo-
nents in the vehicle electrical system.

Non-automatic overvoltage-protection 
 device
This type of overvoltage-protection device 
is connected directly to the terminals D+ 
and D– on T1 alternators, e.g. in buses and 
heavy trucks (Fig. 18). The unit responds  
to voltage peaks and overvoltages at these 
terminals which exceed its response 
threshold of 31 V. At this point, thyristor Th 
becomes conductive. The Z diode ZD acts 
as a setpoint generator. The necessary re-
sponse delay is regulated by resistors R1 
and R2 along with capacitor C. The unit 
 requires only milliseconds to short circuit 
the regulator and alternator via terminals 
D+ and D–. The thyristor assumes responsi-
bility for the short-circuit current. 
 Meanwhile, current from the battery trig-
gers the alternator indicator lamp to alert 
the driver. The thyristor remains active, 
 reverting to its off-state only when the 
short-circuit current has stopped flowing, 
i.e. after the ignition has been switched off, 
or the engine and alternator come to rest.
The unit will not provide overvoltage 
protection if the wires at terminals D+ and 
D– are reversed.

The alternator indicator lamp does not 
indicate this fault. To ensure a reliable 
display, a safety diode DS is connected 
between terminals D+ and D–. If the con-
nections are reversed, this diode is poled 
to allow current flow, and the alternator 
indicator lamp remains on continuously.

Overvoltage-protection device with 
 automatic starting mechanism
This type of protection device is designed 
for use with T1 alternators (Fig. 19).  
The unit incorporates two inputs, D+ and 
B+ which react to different voltage levels 
and with varying response times. Input D+ 
provides rapid overvoltage protection,  
as on the device described above.

The input B+, responds only to defects at 

the voltage regulator, while the alternator 
voltage continues to climb until it reaches 
the unit’s response voltage of  approx. 31 V. 
The alternator then remains shorted until 
the engine is switched off.  lnput B+ is thus 
designed to prevent consequential dam-
age.

Alternators  |  Overvoltage protection  |  451

Voltage peaks which can be generated  
by the alternator itself when loads are 
switched off (“load dump”) cannot damage 
other consumers in the system because the 
 alternator is immediately short-circuited. 
In addition, the vehicle electrical system  
is protected against consequential damage 
if the regulator is faulty.

Consequential-damage protection device
This protection device is designed for use 
with the Double-TI alternator with two sta-
tors and two excitation systems (Fig. 20). 
While the overvoltage-protection devices 
short-circuit the alternator, the conse-
quential-damage protection unit functions 
as a kind of backup regulator, even with 
the battery out of circuit during emer-
gency operation. Provided that the alter-
nator’s speed and the load factor allow it, 
the protection unit maintains a mean alter-
nator voltage of approx. 24 V, thereby 
 enabling emergency operation.

The consequential-damage protection 
 device responds to battery operation and  
a faulty, short-circuited regulator by inter-
rupting the alternator’s excitation circuit 
for approx. 2 seconds after the alternator 
output passes the response threshold of 

30 V. The unit’s relay contact then assumes 
a backup voltage-control function by oper-
ating as a contact regulator. When the sys-
tem is operated with the battery out of cir-
cuit (emergency operation without bat-
tery), the unit reacts to voltage peaks of  
60 V or more which last for more than  
1 ms.

The alternator indicator lamp flashes  
to indicate that the system is working in 
emergency operation mode. The system 
does not charge the battery, as the mean 
voltages in this mode are very low. The 
maximum operating time of the substitute 
regulating function is approx. 10 hours. 
The consequential-damage protection 
 device will then have to be replaced.

Characteristic curves

Alternator performance
Due to the constant transmission ratio be-
tween alternator and engine, the alterna-
tor must be able to operate across a wide 
engine-speed range. The characteristic 
performance of the alternator is shown  
by its characteristics. 

The alternator full-load curve relates to 
a constant alternator voltage and a defined 
ambient temperature.

Current characteristic 
Defined speed points of the alternator are 
used to describe the current characteristic 
(Fig. 21). 

0-Ampere speed (n0)
The 0-ampere speed is the speed at which 
the alternator reaches its nominal voltage 
without delivering power (approx. 
1,000 rpm). The alternator can only  
deliver power at higher speeds.

Speed at engine idle (nL),
current at engine idle (IL)
The alternator speed at engine idle is given 
as a range in the diagram because its value 
depends on the turns ratio between the 
 alternator and the engine. In the case of

compact-diode-assembly alternators,  
it is defined as nL = 1,500 rpm; for compact 
alternators, nL = 1,800 rpm due to the usu-
ally higher turns ratio.

The current generated by the alternator 
at engine idle speed (idle current) must at 
least be sufficient to supply the perma-
nently active consumers. 

Rated speed (nN),
rated current (IN)
The rated current is the full-load current 
of the alternator that it delivers at rated 
speed nN = 6,000 rpm, at alternator voltage 
UG = 13.5 V and at ambient temperature 
TU = 23  °C.

Maximum speed (nmax), 
maximum current (Imax)
The maximum current Imax is the highest 
current that the alternator is able to gener-
ate. At high speeds, the effect of the re-
verse magnetization field generated by the 
load current prevents the characteristic 
from climbing any higher. The speed of the 
alternator is first and foremost limited by 
its type of construction. The maximum 
speed of compact alternators is in the 
 region of 18,000 to 22,000 rpm, 15,000 to 
18,000 rpm for compact-diode-assembly 
alternators and between 8,000 and 
15,000 rpm for commercial-vehicle 
 alternators.

Characteristic of drive power 
The characteristic of power input is used 
as a basis for designing the drive belt.  
The characteristic shows the maximum 
power transferred from the engine to the 
alternator across the engine’s speed range. 
The alternator’s drive power and power 
output can also be used to calculate its 
 efficiency. 

The characteristic of drive power is flat 
in the middle engine-speed range and in-
creases sharply at higher speeds. 

Alternators  |  Power losses, alternator circuits  |  453

Power losses

Efficiency
The maximum efficiency of a modern,  
air-cooled alternator is around 70  % at  
full load. In automotive applications, the 
alternator mainly operates in the part-load 
range, in which an efficiency of up to 75  % 
is achieved. 

Presuming the same loading, using a 
larger, heavier alternator means that oper-
ation can take place across a more favor-
able portion of the efficiency program map 
(Fig. 22). On the other hand, the increased 
efficiency of the larger alternator can be 
offset by an accompanying increase in fuel 
consumption. 

Alternator circuits

Parallel-connected power diodes
With large alternators with rated currents 
of over 180 A, the six power diodes of the 
three-phase-current bridge circuit could 
be damaged by overheating. For this rea-
son, large alternators have two or more 
power diodes per phase connected in par-
allel (Fig. 24, Item 2, two diodes in this ex-
ample). The alternator current is divided 
between the diodes connected in parallel 

so that a commensurately weaker current 
flows through the individual diodes. 

Auxiliary diodes at the star (neutral) 
point
On three-phase alternators with star-con-
nected stator windings, the ends of the 
windings are joined at a single point, the 
star or neutral point. Thanks to two addi-
tional (auxiliary) diodes connected as 
power diodes between the neutral point 
and positive or negative terminal (Fig. 24, 
Item 3), it is possible to make use of the 
third-harmonic voltage induced in-phase 
in all three paths. The induced voltage of 
the third harmonic reaches vehicle system 
voltage above an alternator speed of ap-
prox. 3,000 rpm.  Beyond this speed, the 
auxiliary diodes contribute to the increase 
in power and  efficiency. However, this ad-
ditional proportion also increases the rip-
ple of the  alternator voltage.

Operation of alternators in parallel
Alternators of the same voltage can be 
connected in parallel to meet demands  
for high power. The voltage regulators 
concerned must have the same regulating 
characteristics, and their characteristics 
must be identical.

Interference-suppression measures
The electromagnetic fields of the alterna-
tor and other electrical consumers of a 
motor vehicle may interfere with other 
electrical and electronic equipment.

If a 2-way radio, car sound system, or 
car telephone etc. is operated in the vehi-
cle itself or in the vicinity, it is necessary  
to install intensified interference suppres-
sion for alternator and regulator. Alterna-
tors are generally therefore fitted with a 
suppression capacitor. In the case of older 
compact-diode-assembly alternators, the 
suppression capacitor can be retrofitted 
on the outside of the slipring end shield. 

On compact alternators, it is already inte-
grated in the rectifier. 

Older versions of the contact regulator 

are combined with an interference-sup-
pression filter or are replaced by an inter-
ference-suppressed version. Transistor 
regulators do not require additional sup-
pression measures.

Alternator designs

Design criteria
Various different operating conditions, 
and the power ranges of the vehicle types 
and engines concerned, led to the develop-
ment of a number of basic models which 
will be described in the following.

The following data are decisive for alter-

nator design:
 ▶ Vehicle type and the associated operat-

ing conditions

 ▶ Speed range of the engine with which 

the alternator is to be used

 ▶ Battery voltage of the vehicle electrical 

system

 ▶ Current draw of consumers
 ▶ Environmental loading imposed on the 
alternator (heat, dirt, dampness, etc.)
 ▶ Available installation space, dimensions

These criteria are decisive in the electrical 
dimensioning required for the alternator, 
i.e. 
 ▶ The alternator voltage (14 V/28 V) 
 ▶ The maximum power output 
(voltage × current intensity)

 ▶ The maximum current 

Design of the compact alternator
The housing of the alternator comprises 
the drive and slipring end shield (Fig. 26), 
between which the stator is clamped.  
The rotor shaft runs in bearings in each 
end shield. 

The stator (3) of the alternator consists 
of mutually insulated, grooved laminations 
which are pressed together to form a solid 
laminated core. The turns of the three-
phase stator winding are embedded in  
the grooves.

The rotor gives the claw-pole alternator its 
name: it comprises two oppositely-poled 
pole-wheel halves whose two claw-shaped 
pole fingers mesh with each other in the 
form of alternating north and south poles 
(Fig. 27). 

The number of poles which can be real-
ized in practice is limited. Whereas on the 
one hand, a low number of poles leads to a 
low machine efficiency, on the other hand, 
the more poles there are, the higher is the 
magnetic leakage. For this reason, such 
 alternators are designed as 12-pole or  
16-pole machines depending upon the 
power range.

The pole-wheel halves overlap the ring-
coil-shaped excitation winding located  
on the pole body (Fig. 28). The excitation 
current reaches the excitation winding 
through carbon brushes which are 
mounted in the slipring end shield and 
pressed against the sliprings by springs.

The magnetic flux flows through the pole 
body and the left-hand pole half and its 
pole fingers, across the air gap to the sta-
tionary stator lamination with stator wind-
ing, from where it flows back to the pole 
body through the right-hand pole half and 
completes the magnetic circuit. 

The compact alternator is cooled by two 
ventilators (Fig. 26, Item 9) fitted on the 
drive and slipring sides of the rotor. Each 
ventilator draws in cooling air from the 
front end of the alternator and forces out 
the (warm) air radially (double-flow venti-
lation). These two small ventilators gener-
ate considerably less noise than the single 
large ventilator in a compact-diode-assem-
bly alternator. In addition, they are de-
signed for higher speeds (maximum speed: 
18,000 to 22,000 rpm). These two special 
features permit a higher conversion ratio 
between crankshaft and alternator which 
means that for the same speed and size 
compact alternators can generate up to 
25 % more power.

The pulley for the belt drive is also 
mounted on the rotor shaft. Alternator 
 rotors can be rotated in either direction. 
The ventilator must be designed for clock-
wise or counterclockwise rotation. 

The electronic voltage regulator forms a 
single unit with the brush holder (6), pro-
vided it is intended to be directly mounted 
on the alternator. In some cases, the elec-
tronic voltage regulator on commercial 
 vehicles is secured to a protected part of 
the body independently of the alternator 
and connected to the brush holder by elec-
trical plug-in connections.

Design of the compact-diode-assembly 
alternator
The claw-pole alternator of compact-
 diode-assembly design (Fig. 29) differs 
from the compact alternator first and fore-
most in the large ventilator (2), which is 
 located between belt pulley (1) and the 
bowl-shaped alternator body. The external 
ventilator with a maximum speed of 
12,000 to 18,000 rpm draws cooling air 
 axially through the housing (single-flow 
ventilation). 

Other differences with the compact-
 diode-assembly alternator are the larger 
sliprings (7) and the position of the recti-
fier inside slipring end shield (6). 

Double-T1 alternator
The Double-T1 alternator consists of  
two electrically and mechanically coupled 
T1-size alternators in a common housing 
(Fig. 31) The electronic voltage regulator  

is installed inside the alternator. The elec-
trical circuit of the two stators and the  
two excitation systems is illustrated in 
 Figure 30. Between D+ and D- there is a 
100 watt resistor, which causes the alter-
nator indicator lamp to light up in case of 
an open-circuit field. 

The Double-T1 alternator (DT1) is used 

in buses that place high power demands 
made on the alternator due to rising de-
mands for more comfort.

Windingless-rotor alternators without 
sliprings
A typical feature of the windingless rotor 
(Fig. 32) is that the housing with the stator 
core (4), the heat sinks with power diodes, 
the attached transistorized voltage regula-
tor (8), and the internal pole with excita-
tion winding (5) all belong to the station-
ary part of the alternator, so sliding con-
tacts are not required.

The rotating part merely comprises the ro-
tor (6) with pole wheel and conductive ele-
ment. Six pole fingers of the same polarity 
form a single north or south pole-finger 
crown. Only one of the two pole-finger 

crowns is directly connected to the rotor 
shaft. The two crowns form claw-pole half 
sections, and are retained by a non-mag-
netic ring positioned below the mutually-
engaged pole fingers.

In the process, the magnetic flux travels 
from the rotating rotor’s pole core, 
through the stationary internal pole to  
the conductive element, from whose pole 
finger it then flows to the stationary stator 
core. The magnetic circuit closes in the 
 rotor’s pole core via the oppositely poled 
claw half. In comparison to a slipring rotor, 
the magnetic flux must cross two addi-
tional air gaps between the rotating pole 
wheel and the stationary internal pole. 

The alternator with windingless rotors is 
also available as a liquid-cooled version.  
A considerable reduction of noise is 
achieved here in comparison to air-cooled 
alternators because the alternator is com-
pletely encapsulated and there is no venti-
lator to produce aerodynamic noise. 
 Engine coolant flows around the complete 
jacket and rear of the alternator casing. 
The electronic components are mounted 
on the drive end shield. 

With the omission of the slipring/carbon-
brush system wear component, these al-
ternators are particularly suitable for ap-
plications requiring a long service life in 
which the alternator is subjected to heavy 
loads, e.g. for construction machines or 
railway alternators.

Salient-pole alternators 
Salient-pole alternators are required  
in special applications which are charac-
terized by extreme power demands  
(as in tour buses) (Fig. 33) The rotor is 
equipped with individual magnetic poles, 
each of which is provided with its own 
field winding. This layout allows the stator 
to be substantially longer (relative to its 
 diameter) than would be possible with  
a claw-pole alternator. This means that 
higher outputs can be achieved without 

 increasing diameter. The achievable maxi-
mum speeds, however, are lower in com-
parison to claw-pole versions because the 
rotor windings are not as well protected 
against centrifugal forces as they are with 
claw-pole alternators. 

The losses in the regulator are also 
greater (in comparison to the claw-pole 
 alternator) due to the substantially greater 
excitation current. The regulator is there-
fore fitted separately in a special housing 
where it can be cooled more effectively.

Starting systems

Internal-combustion engines must be 
cranked by a starter at a minimum speed 
before they can supply sufficient energy 
in sustained operation from the combus-
tion cycles to cover the momentary re-
quirements for the compression and  
gas exchange cycles. When an engine  
is first started, the bearing surfaces are 
not adequately lubricated so that high 
levels of friction have to be overcome 
when cranking the engine. 

Overview

Electric motors (direct current, alternating 
current and three-phase AC motors), and 
also hydraulic and pneumatic motors, are 
used to start internal-combustion engines. 
The electrical direct current series motor 
is particularly suitable as a starter motor, 
as it develops the high initial torque re-
quired to overcome the engine’s initial 
 resistance to rotation and to accelerate  
the masses in the engine. 

The energy required for starting is gen-
erally drawn from the battery, which also 
supplies other electrical components in 
the vehicle electrical system. 

The torque from the starter is more often 
than not transferred by way of a pinion and 
a ring gear on the engine, but in some cases 
a V-belt, toothed belt or chain is used, or it 
is applied directly to the crankshaft. 

In order to start the engine, the starter-
 motor pinion (Fig. 1, Item 7) engages in the 
ring gear on the engine (12). The ring gear 
has typically approx. 130 teeth (103 to 144 
on passenger cars, 110 to 160 on commer-
cial vehicles) and is fitted on the engine  
flywheel on vehicles with manual trans-
mission, while on vehicles with automatic 
transmission, it is fitted on the torque-
 converter housing. When in its intitial posi-
tion, the starter pinion, which typically has 
10 teeth (8 to 10 in passenger cars, 9 to 13 
in commercial vehicles) is disengaged from 
the ring gear, but remains only a few milli-
meters away from it. When the driver turns 

the ignition key to the start position, a me-
chanical connection is first established be-
tween the starter motor and the ring gear 
(meshing), so as to then be able to transfer 
the torque of the starter motor, which then 
starts running, to the engine.

Because of the high conversion ratio 
 between the starter pinion and the ring 
gear, the starter may be designed for high 
speeds and low torque. This allows the 
 dimensions and the weight of the starter  
to be kept small. 

Starter

Working phases of the pre-engaged-
drive starter
The pre-engaged-drive starter has estab-
lished itself the worldwide standard for 
vehicles. The meshing travel consists of 
thrust and helical travel.

Meshing
The ignition lock in the start position 
closes the ignition/starting switch (Fig. 1a, 
Item 1), which triggers the engagement 
 relay (2). The magnetic field created by  
the relay coil energizes the relay armature, 
thus  operating the engagement lever (5) so 
that the pinion gear (7) is moved forwards 
and comes into contact with the ring gear 
(12) (pinion travel). A helical spline (10) on  
the shaft turns the pinion slightly against 
the starter’s driving direction in the pre-
meshing process, thus making the meshing 
process easier.

Under ideal circumstances, one tooth  

of the pinion will encounter a space be-
tween the teeth in the ring gear, thereby 
establishing the coupling between the 
starter and the internal-combustion en-
gine (Fig. 1b). During the movement of the 
 pinion into the ring gear, the engagement 
relay armature closes the starter motor’s 
main circuit at the contact bridge. The 
starter motor thus starts to rotate so that 
its drive shaft and pinion gear drive the 
ring gear, with the result that the engine 
also starts to turn (Fig. 1d).

This ideal meshing of the pinion with the 
ring gear is not, however, the normal case,  
as the 0.4 mm backlash between the teeth 
leaves very little leeway for smooth meshing.
In many cases (approx. 50 to 80 % of 
starts, depending on the geometrical con-
ditions), there is a clash in which the teeth 
of the pinion and those of the ring gear 
block each other (Fig. 1c). The pinion can 
then not move any further outwards and 
mesh with the ring gear unless it is rotated. 
However, in this case too, the engagement 
relay armature continues to be drawn fur-
ther into the coil so that the engagement 
lever compresses the meshing spring 
(Fig.1a, Item 11). Consequently, the pinion 
is pressed with increasing force against the 
ring gear. 

As it reaches the end of its travel, the 
 engagement relay closes the switch in the 
starter-motor main circuit. As a result,  
the pinion starts to turn and at some point 
reaches a position where it will mesh with 
the ring gear. The pre-stressed meshing 
spring now forces the pinion forwards via 

2 Phases of the starting procedure

the helical spline (helical travel) until it 
meshes fully in the ring gear. The pinion  
is pushed into the ring gear by the screw 
effect of the helical spline in conjunction 
with the rotary motion of the starter mo-
tor. The helical spline prevents transmis-
sion of torque to the engine until the pin-
ion is fully meshed in the ring gear. 

Overloading the gear teeth must be 
avoided in commercial vehicles because  
of the high torques which are transferred. 
Appropriate meshing principles ensure 
that there is sufficient overlap of pinion 
and ring gear teeth before the starter 
 motor delivers its full power. 

Breakaway and cranking 
Once the pinion is meshed, the starter 
transfers the torque to the engine crank-
shaft. 

The torque delivered by the starter is at  
its highest when first switched from stand-
still and decreases continuously as speed 
increases. The surplus torque provided

by the starter motor at the beginning of 
the starting sequence initially overcomes 
the static friction in the engine bearing 
surfaces (breakaway) and then accelerates 
the moving masses in the engine and ancil-
laries to the turnover speed. This is char-
acterized by the intersection of the engine 
and starter torque curves (Fig. 2), i.e. at 
higher speeds, the starter-motor torque  
is no longer sufficient to continue driv-
ing the engine. The turnover speed must 
therefore be higher than the minimum 
cranking speed for a successful start. 

Starting and overrunning
A warm engine will normally take only  
two revolutions of the crankshaft to start. 
A cold engine may have to be cranked for  
a little longer (up to a minute is not uncom-
mon). If, for whatever reason, the fuel sys-
tem needs to be purged of air when the 
 engine is started, it may have to be turned 
over for as long as 20 to 30 seconds before 
it starts.

The engine-management system uses 
sensors to detect the position of the crank-
shaft within the first two revolutions (initi-
ation of the fuel-injection system). Their 
signals are used to selectively deliver fuel 
to the cylinder that will be the next to per-
form its compression stroke. This ensures 
a rapid starting sequence with low levels 
of exhaust emissions.

As soon as fuel is injected/ignited, the in-
ternal-combustion engine starts to gener-
ate its own torque and, therefore, to in-
crease its speed of rotation, although this 
is not sufficient for starting in all cases.  
To attain the air-fuel mixture required by 
the gasoline engine or, as the case may be, 
the spontaneous-ignition temperature re-
quired by the diesel engine for sustained 
operation, the starter may have to con-
tinue to assist the internal-combustion 
 engine to reach the minimum sustained 
operation speed. After only a few ignition 
cycles, the engine accelerates so sharply 
that the starter can no longer match its 

speed and is outrun. At this point, it is es-
sential that the roller-type overrunning 
clutch disengages the pinion from the 
starter-motor drive shaft. By doing so,  
it protects the starter motor against over-
speed and prevents excessive wear. 

As soon as the driver releases the ignition 
key, the solenoid-switch circuit is broken. 
The return spring moves the relay arma-
ture back towards its initial position as a 
result of which the primary-circuit switch 
opens. The demeshing spring completes 
the retraction of the pinion, disengaging  
it from the ring gear. Demeshing is here 
supported by the rotary motion of the pin-
ion as it returns over the helical spline. 
The starter motor freewheels to a stand-
still and the entire mechanism  returns to 
its initial position.

Switch-off function
The relay armature is connected to the 
 engagement lever in such a way that there 
is a certain amount of free travel or “play”.  
If the engine fails to achieve sustained op-
eration (e.g. due to lack of fuel), the starting 
sequence must be aborted. At that point, 
the pinion is fully engaged, and  pinion and 
ring gear are under maximum load. 

When the power supply to the relay is 
switched off, there must be sufficient relay 
armature free travel to allow it to open  
the primary-circuit switch. If this were not 
the case, the engagement lever would hold 
the relay armature in place. The primary-
circuit switch would remain closed and it 
would not be possible to stop the starter 
motor.

On commercial-vehicle starters, the geo-
metrical constraints demand that a cutout 
spring (Fig. 3) is used instead of the free-
travel arrangement explained above.  
The force of this spring when the pinion is 
in its initial position overcomes the force 
of the relay armature return spring and 
pushes the armature back against the stop 
on the lever. When the relay armature is 

466  |  Starting systems  |  Starter

pulled in, on the other hand, the force  
of the armature return spring must be 
 sufficient to compress the cutout spring 
enough for the contact bridge of the  
switch contacts to be lifted away.

Engagement relay
Relays are used to switch a high current by 
means of a relatively low control current. 
The starter current can be as high as 
1,500 A on vehicles and as much as  
2,500 A on commercial vehicles. As con-
tacts for currents of this level are heavily 
loaded, the use of a power relay is an abso-
lute requirement. The relay is actuated by 
a relatively low control current (relay cur-
rent) of approx. 30 A for vehicles and up  
to approx. 80 A in commercial vehicles.  
A simple mechanical switch (ignition/start-
ing switch, starter button) or a mini- relay 
operated by the engine control unit can 
then be used to switch the engine on.

The engagement relay (Fig. 4) built into  
the starter is the combination of an en-
gagement solenoid and a relay. It fulfills 
two functions:
 ▶ It advances the drive pinion so that it 
meshes with the engine’s ring gear

 ▶ It closes the contact bridge which com-
pletes the starter’s primary electric 
 circuit

The magnetic core (4) is firmly fixed to the 
housing and protrudes into the solenoid 
winding (2, 3) from one side, while the 
movable relay armature (1) protrudes from 
the other side. The distance between the 
magnetic core and the armature when at 
rest represents the total travel of the relay 
armature. The solenoid housing, magnetic 
core and relay armature together form the 
magnetic circuit. 

The solenoid force created when the 
current is switched on draws the armature 
into the winding. That armature movement 
firstly causes the engagement lever to dis-
place the pinion along its longitudinal axis, 
and secondly forces the contact bridge (8) 
against the main current contacts (6).
The relay winding in most designs 

 consists of a pull-in winding and a hold-in 
winding (Fig. 4, Items 2 and 3, and Fig. 5, 
Items 4a and 4b). This division of tasks is 
particularly effective with regard to ther-
mal stress  capacity and the magnetic 
forces which can be achieved. 

In the initial position (no current applied 
to the relay), the air gap between armature 
and magnetic core is relatively large. Only 
a high magnetomotive force can overcome 
meshing resistance. 

The air gap closes up as the armature 
 retracts and the solenoid force increases

significantly. When the relay armature is 
fully retracted, i.e. when there is practi-
cally no residual air gap, the solenoid force 
of the hold-in winding on its own is suffi-
cient to hold the armature in position until 
the starting sequence is completed. The 
pull-in winding is short-circuited across 
the main-circuit switch and the ignition 
switch when the armature is pulled in. 

It is important that the pull-in winding 

and the hold-in winding have the same 
number of turns. Otherwise, the solenoid 
switch might adopt a self-locking charac-
teristic during switching off due to the 
supply of the windings, which would then 
be connected in series, in reverse through 
terminal 45. Having the same number  
of turns in each winding ensures that the 
magnetic fields of the two coils through 
which the current now flows in opposite 
directions cancel each other out and the 
relay switches off reliably.

Since the starter causes a substantial volt-
age drop in the vehicle electrical system 
when its primary current is switched on, 
the hold-in winding must be dimensioned 
so as to be capable of reliably holding the 
armature in place even at supply voltages 
significantly below half the nominal bat-
tery voltage. Otherwise, the relay switch 
might under certain circumstances repeat-

edly switch on and off in rapid succession, 
resulting in damage to the switch contacts. 
Return springs between the individual 
components ensure that the switch opens 
again when the solenoid is switched off 
and the relay armature returns to its initial 
position.

All starter terminals (terminals 50, 30 
and 45) are usefully incorporated within 
an assembly on the cap of the engagement 
relay. The engagement relay cap is usually 
made of duromer material which provides 
the required mechanical loadability even 
at high levels of thermal stress (up to 
180 °C for short periods) and thus ensures 
that the engagement relay and all its 
 components are held together reliably.  
In order to ensure reliable retraction and 
switching of the relay even at high temper-
atures, there are special winding designs 
that can also withstand temperatures of  
up to 180 °C.

The primary-circuit switch contacts on car 
starters generally consist of steel studs 
with riveted copper contacts that provide 
reliable switching characteristics and mini-
mal switch impedance. The relay switches 
for commercial-vehicle starter motors are 
manufactured as one-piece components 
from a high-strength copper alloy in order 
to provide high current capacity. A conical 
form of contact is increasingly being used 
to reduce bounce, and thus the wear, on the 
contacts in commercial vehicle starters. 

Depending on the type of wiring harness 

used, the control-circuit terminal (termi-
nal 50) may take the form of a screw termi-
nal or some type of plug-in contacts which 
may or may not be sealed.

Engagement relays for vehicles normally 
have a round plug connector to connect 
the cap to the relay winding. This allows a 
closed-surface cap design without riveted 
or soldered connections or the holes they 
would require. In addition, the standard 
arrangement provides for a seal between 
the cap and the relay housing.

For situations requiring special sealing 
 arrangements, the relay armature can  
be protected by a flexible rubber boot  
(Fig. 6, Item 2) in order to prevent the in-
gress of humidity from the starter’s pin-
ion-engaging drive. This measure is pri-
marily  adopted for applications in which  
it is not possible to entirely prevent the en-
try of water into the drive end shield. An-
other area where this armature boot may 
be used are those installation positions 
where the engagement relay is pointing 
downwards, with the result that moisture 
can collect in the drive end shield cover.

Some large commercial-vehicle starters 
do not have an integral engagement relay; 
instead, the engagement solenoid for pin-
ion advance and the control relay for elec-
trical switching stages are separate from 
one another.

One-way clutch
In all starter designs, the torque is trans-
mitted from the starter motor to the pinion 
through a one-way clutch (overrunning 
clutch). The task of the one-way clutch is 
to transmit the drive to the pinion when 
the drive shaft is driven and to disengage 
the pinion from the drive shaft once  
the pinion is rotating more quickly.  
The one-way clutch therefore prevents the 
 armature of the starter motor from being 

accelerated to excessive speeds once the 
engine has started.

Roller-type overrunning clutches for 
starters can be either frictional (roller and 
multi-plate overrunning clutch) or posi-
tively interlocking (spur-gear overrunning 
clutch) in design.

Roller-type overrunning clutch
Pre-engaged-drive starters normally have 
roller-type overrunning clutches (Fig. 7). 
The driver and clutch shell (3) is connected 
to the drive shaft by means of a  helical 
spline. The frictional connection between 
the central cylindrical shaft of the pinion 
and the clutch shell of the driver surround-
ing it is formed by cylindrical rollers (5) that 
are able to move within the roller race (4).
When the mechanism is at rest, the 
springs (7) force the rollers into the con-
stricted space between the roller race in 
the clutch shell and the pinion shaft (6). 
Because of the constriction, the rollers jam 
between the surfaces of the roller race and 
the pinion shaft, so that when the starter 
motor starts running, the pinion is turned 
at the same time.

Once the overrunning process com-
mences, the friction between the pinion 
shaft and the rollers pushes the rollers 
against the spring force into the wider part 
of the roller race; the force of the springs

ensures that the rollers are held in contact 
with the pinion shaft and roller race at all 
times. The resulting overrunning torque is 
relatively small and has very little effect as 
far as the idle speed of the starter-motor 
armature is concerned.

Spur-gear overrunning clutch
A spur-gear overrunning clutch (Fig. 8) is 
fitted on Type JE and KE sliding-gear start-
ers in combination with a mechanical 
two-stage pinion-engaging drive. The 
roller-type overrunning clutch transfers 
positive torque by means of a spur gear.

During the overrunning process, the ring 
gear on the engine’s flywheel is driving the 
pinion (1) which is connected to the clutch 
race (4) by a spur gear. Due to the sawtooth 
form of the spur gear, the clutch race is 
forced inwards along the helical gear to-
wards the starter motor when the pinion is 
overrunning. Separation of the pinion and 
clutch race is assisted by three flyweights 
(2) which apply an axial force on the clutch 
race via a tapered thrust ring (3).

Item 3). The plates are alternately engaged 
by driver cams with the drive flange (1) 
and with the clutch race (4). The individual 
plates are mounted so that they can move 
in the axial direction, but cannot be 
twisted radially against the drive flange  
or clutch race. The external drive flange  
is firmly connected to the armature shaft. 
The clutch race, on the other hand, can  
be rotated helically on the drive spindle’s 
helical spline (7). 

Frictional connection
In order that the multi-plate overrunning 
clutch can use friction to transmit the 
drive from the motor to the pinion, there 
has to be a certain amount of pressure 
holding the plates against one another 
(Fig. 9a). When the clutch is in its initial 
position, the laminated core (3) is com-
pressed by a light, pre-tensioned spring 
force on a shaft spring (on K starters; 8) or 
by studs and springs (on Q and T starters) 
to such as extent that the friction created 
is able to drive the clutch race (4).

Multi-plate overrunning clutch 
The multi-plate overrunning clutch is used 
on larger sliding-gear starters (KB, QB, QF, 
TB, TF). The frictional connection between 
armature and starter pinion is achieved by 
means of a circular laminated core (Fig. 9, 

Once the pinion has meshed and reached 
the limit of its outward travel, full frictional 
connection comes into operation for start-
ing. Because the pinion is held stationary 
while the armature shaft is rotating, the 
clutch race slides outwards on the helical

spline (7) of the output shaft and presses 
against the disk spring. This further com-
presses the laminated core and increases 
the pressure between the individual 
plates. Compression continues to increase 
until the friction between the plates is suf-
ficient to transmit the torque required to 
start the engine. Frictional connection is 
transmitted as follows:  armature – drive 
flange – outer plates –  inner plates – clutch 
race – drive spindle – pinion (Fig. 9b).

Torque limitation
The increasing plate pressure due to  
the helix effect of the clutch race, and the 
 resulting torque transmitted, are limited  
by the fact that, on reaching the maximum 
load, the end face of the clutch race comes 
into contact with the disk spring. In doing 
so, it uses its end face to press the disk 
spring against the stop collar (6) of the out-
put shaft (Fig. 9c). This prevents the lami-
nated core being compressed any  further. 
The multi-plate overrunning clutch then 
functions as an overload clutch since the 
plates will slip if the  maximum power trans-
mission rating, and therefore the maximum 
tightening torque, is exceeded.

Removal of frictional connection  
(overrunning)
When the engine flywheel accelerates due 
to ignition pulses or the engine starting, the 
pinion starts to turn faster than the starter 
motor. As a result, the direction of force 
transmission is reversed and the clutch race 
is twisted along the helical spline towards 
the armature until it meets the stop ring 
(Fig. 9d, Item 5). The disk spring is released 
and no longer presses against the laminated 
core. The plates consequently separate 
from one another and the frictional connec-
tion between them is removed.

Direct-drive and reduction-gear starters
In a conventional direct-drive starter mo-
tor, the starter pinion rotates at the same 
speed as the armature. The one-way clutch 
and the pinion are mounted directly on the 

Starting systems  |  Starter  |  471

starter motor’s armature shaft. In order to 
be able to deliver the high torque required 
for cold starting, the motor has to be rela-
tively large – and therefore heavy – with 
this type of design. For automotive appli-
cations, therefore, this design is only usual 
for power levels < 1 kW, while in commer-
cial vehicle applications, all more recent 
starter types in the RE/HE(F) series are 
 reduction-gear starters.

Thanks to the use of a planetary gear, 
the same torque is achieved on the reduc-
tion-gear starter with a smaller and faster 
rotating electric motor. Depending on the 
design, this can allow a weight saving of  
30 to 40  %. 

Planetary gearing systems generally offer 
the advantage of combining compact over-
all dimensions with high gearing ratios.  
If the engagement geometry is favorable, 
this allows the achievement of high torque 
output without generating high levels of 
noise. Furthermore, they do not generate 
any external transverse forces so that the 
armature-shaft and pinion-shaft bearings 
are not subjected to high stresses even at 
high power outputs.

The planetary gearing system (Fig. 10) 
used in starters has a fixed internal 
gear (3). The drive is supplied via the  

10 Planetary gear system

sun gear (2) which is attached to the arma-
ture shaft of the electric motor. The planet 
gears (1) are hence in engagement with 
both the sun gear and the internal gear.  
As the planet gears orbit around the sun 
gear, their  bearing-shaft journals drive the 
drive shaft which carries the helical spline 
and one-way clutch.

The transmission ratio between the ar-
mature and the pinion is variable across  
a broad range from approx. 3 : 1 to 6 : 1 
 depending on the design of the planetary 
gear. This allows optimum matching of the 
starter to the characteristics of the engine 
and the vehicle’s electrical network. 

Lower transmission ratios allow higher 
engine speeds for warm starting, while a 
higher conversion ratio enables the starter 
to cope with extreme cold-starting condi-
tions and result in lower power consump-
tion by the starter when turning the engine 
over.

The reduction-gear starter offers further 
benefits. For instance, the high armature 
speed obtained as a result of the high con-
version ratio creates a flywheel effect 
which helps to turn the internal-combus-
tion engine through top dead center cylin-
der positions and smooth out engine- 
speed fluctuations. As a result, the engine 
has a higher momentary speed precisely  
at the point when fuel is injected or at igni-
tion, and this has a positive effect on the 
fuel-injection pattern (and therefore the 
ease with which the engine starts) and 
 exhaust-gas values. 

On internal-combustion engines with 

smaller numbers of cylinders, this fly-
wheel effect also has the advantage that 
the high peak-torque levels of the individ-
ual cylinders can be reliably overcome 
with a relatively low amount of starting 
power.

472  |  Starting systems  |  Other types of starter motor

 ▶ Most starters have a drive end shield 

which has a “mouth” close to the engine 
flywheel. This mouth carries the bearing 
hub and has an opening near the fly-
wheel. The bearings used can be plain  
or roller bearings (in some cases sealed). 
The meshing drive (pinion and roller-
type overrunning clutch) is open to-
wards the ring gear.

 ▶ For applications where the pinion-en-

gaging drive would be subjected to high 
levels of dirt, moisture or clutch-plate 
dust, the closed-shield design is prefer-
able. The pinion bearing surfaces are 
completely enclosed within the drive 
end shield. Shaft seals provide such ef-
fective protection that these starters are 
suitable for even the most unfavorable 
conditions. In order to be able to cope 
with the higher bearing loads and resist 
wear and tear throughout the full ser-
vice life of the motor, the pinion bearing 
surfaces are suitably reinforced.

Closed-shield starters also have advan-
tages in terms of fitting because they  
do not require a mounting flange that is 
shaped to match the “mouth” opening. 
Consequently, they allow more scope for 
choice of fitted position and the space 
 requirements in the bell housing are 
smaller.

Nevertheless, the following features pre-
vent the general use of this design:
 ▶ The bearing forces in the drive end 

shield and the effective radius of friction 
are about twice as great as for an 
open-shield starter, with the result that 
friction-related power losses are greater 
(rolling bearings can help to alleviate 
this problem and also improve wear and 
noise characteristics).

 ▶ Bearings, seals and elongated starter 
pinion design result in higher costs.
 ▶ The overall length of the starter in-

creased by this design.

 ▶ The gearing ratios, and therefore the 

noise characteristics, are less favorable.

Starters for commercial vehicles with 
electrical two-stage pinion-engaging 
system
Various starters in the higher performance 
range for commercial vehicles (HEF95-L, 
HEF95-M) are equipped with an electri-
cally operated, two-stage pinion-engaging 
system (Fig. 12) which permits secure 
meshing while minimizing ring gear wear. 
The first stage of the sequence, with the 
starter motor turning gently, only involves 
starter pinion meshing; at this stage the

bustion engine. The main circuit is only 
closed in the second stage. Two-stage 
meshing is implemented through a  
pilot solenoid and an engagement relay. 
The meshing spring is built into the en-
gagement relay. 

1st switching stage (preliminary stage)
The voltage signal from the ignition lock or 
an electronic control unit initially switches 
the pilot solenoid which is capable of 
switching the high current of approx.  
180 to 200 A (in 24 V starters).

The current then flows through a series 
resistor or a pull-in and hold-in winding. 
First this causes the engagement lever to 
move the one-way clutch with the pinion 
shaft in the axial direction, and second, the 
electric motor is started softly. As a result, 
the pinion can normally be fully meshed in 
the ring gear before the maximum current 
strength is applied to the motor by the clo-
sure of the primary-circuit switch.

2nd switching stage (main stage)
When the pinion has successfully meshed 
with the ring gear, the relay armature dis-
connects the circuit through the series re-
sistor or the pull-in winding by means of 
an NC connector shortly before it reaches 
its fully retracted position. A few milli-
seconds later the primary current is com-
pleted and the starter begins to generate 
its full torque output.

In some cases, the pinion may not engage 
with the ring gear if the two gears are not 
aligned favorably. In this case, the meshing 
spring on the relay armature makes sure 
that the primary current is completed be-
fore the pinion is fully engaged with the 
ring gear. Single-stage meshing is the con-
sequence. 

Sliding-gear starters for commercial 
 vehicles with electrical pinion rotation
Sliding-gear starters incorporating mo-
tor-assisted pinion rotation (Types KB,  
QB, QF, TB, TF, Fig. 13) are used to start 

large-scale internal-combustion engines. 
They have a two-stage electrical pinion-
engagement system in order to reduce  
the loads on the pinion and the ring gear. 

1st switching stage (preliminary stage)
In the first switching stage, therefore,  
the starter pinion is moved outwards along 
the motor axis and simultaneously slowly 
rotated in order to allow smooth meshing 
with the ring gear. 

When the starting switch is operated, 
the control relay and the hold-in winding 
of the engagement solenoid are energized. 
The control relay then immediately com-
pletes the pull-in winding circuit. The en-
gaging armature then pushes the pinion 
against the engine ring gear by means of 
the pinion-engaging axle and the drive 
spindle. 

At the same time, the shunt winding 
which initially is connected in series with 
the starter armature winding is energized. 
It acts in conjunction with the engagement 
solenoid pull-in winding as a series resis-
tor for the starter armature winding. This 
circuit limits the armature current so that 
the starter armature can only produce a 
small amount of torque and, therefore, 
only turns very slowly.

If the pinion teeth are not in a position 
where they can mesh with the ring gear 
when the two gears meet, the pinion con-
tinues to rotate until it is able to mesh with 
the ring gear. The pinion and ring-gear 
teeth can sometimes meet in such a way 
that the pinion can neither rotate nor slide 
outwards into engagement with the ring 
gear (known as tooth-on-tooth); in such 
cases, the starting sequence must be 
aborted and repeated.

2nd switching stage (main stage)
Immediately before the pinion reaches the 
end of its outward travel, a release lever 
lifts up a tripping lever and releases the 
control-relay contact bridge. A pre-loaded 
spring can then abruptly close the switch

contacts. The full current is then applied 
to the starter motor so that it can generate 
its maximum torque output in order to 
turn over the internal-combustion engine 
by means of the multi-plate overrunning 
clutch and the pinion.

Sliding-gear starters for commercial 
 vehicles with mechanical pinion 
 rotation
Sliding-gear starters with mechanical pin-
ion rotation (Types JE and KE) are used to 
start large-scale internal-combustion en-
gines. They have a two-stage mechanical 
pinion-engagement sequence in order to 
reduce the loads on the pinion and the  
ring gear. The most important functional 
component of these starters is the spur-
gear overrunning clutch. 

1st pinion-engagement stage
When the ignition/starting switch is oper-
ated, the engagement relay initially moves 
the pinion-engagement lever against the 
action of the return spring. The engage-
ment lever slides the spur-gear overrun-
ning clutch assembly in a straight line 
along the straight-tooth gearing until it 
meets the ring gear. If the pinion happens 
to be in a position where it can mesh with 
the ring gear, it will continue to move out-
wards to the full extent of its linear travel.

2nd pinion-engagement stage
If the pinion is not in a position where it 
can mesh with the ring gear, the remaining 
components of the spur-gear overrunning 
clutch continue to move outwards on a lin-
ear path towards the ring gear. The action 
of the clutch-race helix forces the pinion 
to rotate in its working direction while 
 simultaneously extending the meshing 
spring of the roller-type overrunning 
clutch. The pinion teeth slip past the teeth 
of the ring gear to the next gap in which 
the pinion can mesh under the force of  
the stretched meshing spring.

The pinion and ring-gear teeth can some-
times meet in such a way that the pinion 
can neither rotate nor slide outwards into 
engagement with the ring gear (known as 
tooth-on-tooth); in such cases, the starting 
sequence must be aborted and repeated. 
When this happens, the helical spline in 
the spur-gear overrunning clutch forces 
the starter armature to rotate in the op-
posite direction to its normal direction 
of rotation (armature reversal) when the 
overrunning clutch is being moved by the 
engagement lever. The next time the start-
ing sequence is performed, the pinion is 
then in a better position relative to the ring 
gear and is able to mesh.

Spur-gear overrunning-clutch and relay 
are precisely matched to each another  
so that the relay contact (primary current 
contact) do not close until meshing is com-
pleted. Consequently, the starter cannot 
develop its full torque until that point.

Starting systems

Starting systems for vehicles
Vehicle starting systems are generally 
equipped with pre-engaged-drive starters 
up to a rated output of approx. 2.5 kW.  
The nominal voltage everywhere is 12 V. 
These can start gasoline engines up to 
 approx. 7 liters engine displacement and 
diesel engines up to approx. 3 liters. The 
starter performance range depends on the 
combustion system: a diesel engine needs 
a higher performance starter than a gaso-
line engine of the same engine capacity. 
The circuit of vehicle starting systems  

is generally a relatively simple design.  
The internal-combustion engine is near 
the driver, who consequently can gener-
ally also monitor the starting process by 
ear. Once the engine is started, it can be 
heard to run so that it is not likely that the 
starter will be unintentionally switched  
on again, meshing the starter pinion in an 
engine-flywheel ring gear that is already 
rotating. This means that no equipment  

Starting systems  |  Starting systems  |  477

to protect and monitor the starting process 
is generally required in a vehicle. In many 
vehicle models, an ignition/starting switch 
with additional start-repeating block is 
 fitted, to prevent inadvertent operation  
of the starter.

In newer luxury class vehicles, auto-

matic control (switching on/off) with 
 engine speed detection has recently 
 become standard. 

Starting systems for gasoline-engine 
 vehicles
The starting system is one of the systems 
controlled via a generally multistage 
 ignition switch. The ignition system is 
switched on before the “Start” switch posi-
tion is reached, as without its intervention 
it is not possible to start the gasoline en-
gine and to achieve sustained operation. 
The ignition process continues after the 
starter is switched off and allows sustained 
operation of the gasoline engine. 

Starting systems for diesel-engine vehicles
The pre-glow system must be switched on 
before the starting process can commence. 
The pre-glow system has a combined driv-

ing-glow start switch, which can be con-
nected directly to the starter once the pre-
heating time is complete. Once the starting 
process is completed, the diesel engine’s 
pre-glow system is switched off along with 
the starter.

Starting systems for commercial 
 vehicles
Medium-sized commercial vehicles with 
diesel engines up to approx. 12 liters en-
gine displacement have starting system 
with 12 V or 24 V nominal voltages.

Heavy commercial vehicles with diesel 
engines up to approx. 24 liters engine dis-
placement use only 24 V starting systems, 
supplied by two 12 V batteries connected 
in series. 

Occasionally, mixed 12/24 V systems  
with a 12 V vehicle electrical system and  
a 24 V starter voltage are used.

Starting systems with start-locking unit
Starting system on vehicles in which the 
starting process cannot be clearly moni-
tored by ear (e.g. on busses with a rear

 engine), require more complex circuitry, 
as they require effective protection for the 
starter and engine ring gear. 

A starting system with an electronic start-
inhibit relay (Fig. 14) protects the starting 
system in a number of ways: 
 ▶ Switching-off once start is successful
 ▶ Inhibiting start if the engine is already 

 ▶ Inhibiting start if the engine is still run-

running

ning down

 ▶ Inhibiting start after failed start, if the 
engine was unable to sustain operation

In the last two cases, it is only possible to 
attempt starting again after an inhibition 
time specified in the relay. This function  
is nowadays more and more frequently 
 integrated into the engine control unit.

Starting system with 12/24 V battery 
changeover
Various commercial vehicles have mixed 
12/24 V installations. In such cases, all 
electrical components, with the exception 
of the starter, including the alternator are 
designed for nominal 12 V operation.  
By contrast, the starter is run at a nominal 

voltage of 24 V. This permits the power 
output required for starting large engines. 
12/24 V systems are equipped with a 
battery changeover relay for this purpose. 
The two 12 V batteries on the vehicle elec-
trical system are connected in parallel in 
normal vehicle operation or when the en-
gine is stopped to supply the consumers, 
providing a voltage of 12 V. 

When the ignition/starting switch is 
 operated, the battery changeover relay 
 automatically switches the two batteries  
to series connection temporarily for the 
starting process, so that a voltage of 24 V  
is applied across the starter terminals.  
All other electrical components continue 
to be supplied with 12 V. 

After the ignition/starting switch is re-
leased, the starter is switched off and the 
batteries are connected in parallel again. 
While the internal-combustion engine is 
running, the 12 V alternator charges the 
batteries (terminal B+). 

Special starting systems for  
commercial vehicles

floor mounted engine, etc.), diesel tractor 
units, ships and stationary engines.  
The different operating conditions often 
demand complex starting systems with 
specially coordinated protection and mon-
itoring relays combined in various differ-
ent ways. These relays control the starting 
process and also permit simultaneous 
start-up of two starters being used in par-
allel operation. The law requires a battery 
master switch on many larger electrical 
systems in commercial vehicles; this 
switch can be used to isolate the vehicle 
electrical system from the battery when 
the engine is not running. 

Of the great variety of special starting sys-
tems for various applications, two particu-
larly significant systems are described 
 below.

Starting system with start-repeating 
 equipment
In starting systems with remote control or 
indirect starter actuation (e.g. in stationary 
installations, diesel traction units and also 
in isolated cases in rear-engined commer-
cial vehicles) a start-repeating relay is 
used, especially if it is not possible to 

 determine directly whether a starting 
 attempt has been successful. 

The start-repeating relay does not re-
spond if the starter pinion has meshed 
successfully. In the event of a malfunction 
(tooth-to-tooth meshing), however, it in-
terrupts the unsuccessful starting attempt 
in order to prevent thermal overloading of 
the starter. It repeats the starting proce-
dure automatically until the starter pinion 
meshes in the ring gear and the contact  
for the starter current is switched on. 

The start-inhibit relay also included in 
the circuit protects the starter against er-
roneous starting if the engine is already 
running or is still running. This circuit is 
used only for sliding-gear starters with 
electrical two-stage switch-on. 

Starting system (12 V or 24 V) with starter 
double relay for parallel operation
Very powerful starters would be required 
if they were to run alone to start very large 
internal-combustion engines. For space 
reasons, it is better to use two smaller 
starters instead of one large one. The two 
starters must drive the engine’s ring gear 
simultaneously in parallel operation so 
that the engine reaches the necessary

cranking speed. If the power supply is 
 adequate, almost twice the starter power 
of a single unit may be achieved if the  
two starters are connected in parallel. 

In addition to the start-inhibit relay and 
the start-repeating relay, a starter double 
relay is connected into the starting system 
in low voltage (12 V or 24 V) parallel start-
ing systems. The starter double relay en-
sures that the full starter current is only 
switched on after both starters are fully 
meshed. This means that the two starters 
develop their full torque simultaneously 
and are uniformly loaded. 

Starter motors for parallel operation 
have an additional terminal connector  
for this purpose. 

HEP109 series parallel starting system
A parallel starting system for 24 volt vehi-
cle electrical systems has been developed 
for internal-combustion engines requiring 
a starting power of approx. 10 to 25 kW 
(Fig. 16). These high powers are necessary 
in construction machinery, large tractors 
and in stationary engines, for instance. 
 Depending on the ambient temperature 
during a cold start and the amount of addi-
tional hydraulic loads when the engine is 
started, the system can be necessary from 
engines with as little as 9 l engine displace-
ment. In the standard application at a cold 
start temperature of – 20  °C, it is designed 
for diesel engines up to 72 l engine dis-
placement and gasoline engines up to  
144 l engine displacement.

The system is based on two or three cou-
pled HEP109 series reduction-gear start-
ers, the closed end shield design of which 
increases the resistance to environmental 
influences. 

Tooth-to-tooth engagement is excluded 

by the design of the HEP109 series start-
ers. This means that the extra circuitry for 
the start-repeating relay can be omitted. 
The functionality of the starter double 
 relay is integrated into the design of the 

 individual parallel starters. Furthermore, 
in a double or triple set-up, only identical 
HEP109 series starters are used, as the 
corresponding coding can be applied as  
an option via a five-pin plug. 

The service life is almost doubled, by 
comparison with a single direct starter, 
thanks to the ideal division of the mechan-
ical and electrical loads.

Automatic starting systems
The high demands on the latest generation 
of vehicles with regard to convenience, 
safety, quality, and low noise levels have 
resulted in an increase in the use of auto-
matic starting systems. An automatic start-
ing system differs from a conventional one 
by virtue of two additional components: 
 ▶ A ballast relay (Fig. 17, Item 2) 
 ▶ A control unit in the vehicle (e.g. an en-
gine control unit, 3) which controls the 
starting sequence. 

The driver then no longer directly controls 
the starter solenoid-switch circuit; instead 
the ignition key is used to send a request 
signal to the control unit, which then per-
forms a series of checks before initiating 
the starting sequence. The following 
checks, for example, are possible:

 ▶ Is the driver authorized to start the 
 vehicle? (theft-deterrence feature)
 ▶ Is the engine at a standstill? (in quiet 

 vehicles or even in buses or coaches, the 
driver can hardly hear the engine inside 
the vehicle)

 ▶ Is the battery sufficiently well charged 

for starting, taking account of the engine 
temperature?

 ▶ For automatic transmissions, is the se-
lector lever in neutral or, for on manu-
ally shifted transmissions, is the clutch 
disengaged, or no gear selected?

When the check has been completed suc-
cessfully, the control initiates the start.  
A current is supplied to the winding of the 
ballast relay to allow this. The ballast relay 
closes the circuit between the battery 
 (terminal 30) and the starter relay.  
The starting sequence then proceeds  
as previously described.

During the starting sequence, the engine 

speed (which is detected by the control 
unit) is compared with a reference figure 
for the speed at which the engine is run-
ning under its own power (the reference 
speed may also be variable according 
to engine temperature). Once the engine 
reaches sustained operation speed, the 
control unit switches the starter off. As a 
result, a short starting time and a reduced 
noise output is achieved and starter wear 
is minimized. 

This process can also be used as the basis 
to implement “start-stop” operation.  
This involves automatically switching  
the internal-combustion engine off when 
the vehicle is stationary and restarting it 
when required. The results are consider-
able fuel savings – particularly in city traf-
fic. At present, reduction-gear starters 
used in this type of system in conjunction 
with a high-quality ring gear can perform 
over 200,000 starts.

Design

Marginal conditions
The most important marginal conditions 
that must be taken into consideration in 
the design of the starter are:
 ▶ The starting temperature, i.e. the lowest 

engine and battery temperature at 
which it must still be possible to start 
the engine

 ▶ The cranking resistance of the engine,  
i.e. the torque required at the crank-
shaft, including that required to accom-
modate auxiliary loads 

 ▶ The required minimum engine speed at 

minimum starting temperature

 ▶ The conversion ratio between starter 

and crankshaft

 ▶ The nominal voltage of starting system
 ▶ The characteristics of the starter battery
 ▶ The resistance in the supply leads be-
tween battery and starter and the con-
tact resistances of terminals and switch-
ing elements (circuit breakers, etc.)

 ▶ The speed/torque characteristics of the 

starter

 ▶ The maximum permissible voltage drop 
in the vehicle electrical system (the con-
tinued functioning of the engine elec-
tronics must be ensured)

The starter cannot be viewed in isolation 
because of these marginal conditions. As a 
component of the overall system consist-
ing of the engine and its ancillary systems, 
vehicle electrical system including battery 
and wiring, and the starter itself, the latter 
must be matched to the other components.

Minimum starting temperature
The degree of frictional resistance that has 
to be overcome is heavily dependent on 
the viscosity of the engine lubricant and 
thus also on engine temperature. At low 
temperatures the frictional resistance  
it can be as much as two or three times 
greater than at normal engine operating 
temperature. As the temperature falls,  
the minimum cranking speed required for 
obtaining satisfactory mixture formation 
in a gasoline engine or compression igni-
tion a diesel engine furthermore increases. 
Consequently, the starter must produce 
significantly greater power output for cold 
starting than when the engine is warm. 

On the other the vehicle can only make a 

reduced voltage or a low current strength 
available, as the internal resistance of the 
lead-acid batteries normally used in-
creases significantly as the temperature 
falls. As a result, the power of the starting 
system is lower at lower temperatures.

The increasing frictional resistances in the 
engine on the one hand, and the declining 
power of the starting system on the other, 
mean that the achievable speed decreases 
and under certain circumstances may not 
be sufficient to start the engine at low tem-
peratures. For this reason, the engine can 
only be successfully started above a spe-
cific temperature, the minimum starting 
temperature (Fig. 18). 

In Europe, starting systems are generally 
designed for the minimum starting tem-
peratures listed in Table 1, with the values 
taking into consideration the varying cli-
matic conditions of the country in which 
the engine is used. 

Cranking resistance
The cranking resistance, i.e. the torque 
 required to turn the engine over, depends 
primarily on the engine capacity and the 
viscosity of the engine oil (and hence on 
the engine temperature). The design of the 
engine, the number of cylinders, the ratio 
of stroke to bore, the compression ratio, 
the mass of the moving engine compo-
nents and the nature of their bearings,  
as well as the additional drag from clutch, 
transmission and auxiliary drive systems 
also have an effect. In general, the mean 
cranking resistance increases with engine 
speed in the case of gasoline engines.  
With diesel engines, on the other hand,  
the resistance may decrease after reaching 
a peak at about 80 to 100 rpm because of 
the energy recuperated from the relatively 
large amount of compression work. 

Minimum cranking speed
The minimum cranking speed varies ac-
cording to engine type, start-assist mea-
sures also have an effect in diesel engines. 
Table 2 shows some empirical values. 

Criteria
The combination of required torque  
at minimum starting temperature and 
 minimum cranking speed provides the 

Table 1

Table 2

Starting systems  |  Design  |  483

 required starter power output, which is 
the initial criterion for selection of starter-
motor type.

Rated output
The rated output of the starter is a charac-
teristic determined on the test bench, 
which depends on the marginal conditions 
for the starting procedure. The figures 
quoted by Bosch relate to cold starting 
with the most powerful battery permitted 
with a charge level of “20 % discharged”  
at a temperature of –20 °C. The impedance 
of the starter cable is 1 mΩ. The power is 
measured at the engine-flywheel ring gear.

as the cold-start requirements and the op-
erational reliability of the assemblies rele-
vant for starting (electronic control units, 
 relays) are met, this is technically permis-
sible. 

If the starter motor is powered by a 
larger battery, the power will exceed the 
rated value. This can lead to overloading 
of the mechanical components, increased 
wear and thermal overload. In the case of 
permanent-magnet starters, it can cause 
partial demagnetization of the magnets 
and irreversible loss of torque output. 
Consequently, the specified battery size 
should not be exceeded.

Rated-output figures are commonly 
quoted on the basis of quite different mar-
ginal conditions. Some other testing re-
quirements and standards are based on a 
temperature of + 20 °C and centric torque-
loading of the pinion so that the losses on 
the engine-flywheel ring gear are ignored. 
Finally, the assumed battery characteris-
tics are also different. Consequently,  
the representation of power specifications 
for starters common today is quite unstan-
dardized. 

Actual output
The actual output output of a starting sys-
tem essentially depends on the internal 
 resistance of the battery and the power 
supply cable. The lower the internal resis-
tance of the battery, the greater its power 
and hence also the power output of the 
starter. The battery must be rated such 
that it is capable of supplying the neces-
sary current at the minimum starting tem-
perature and maintaining it for a suffi-
ciently long period under unfavorable 
 conditions. 

The battery and starter must be matched 

in terms of rating. Starter motors are de-
signed for a maximum and a minimum bat-
tery size. If powered by a smaller battery, 
the actual output of the starting system 
will be less than the rated output. As long 

Transmission ratio
Selection of the correct starter power out-
put (as a composite value of torque and 
speed of rotation) is not sufficient for di-
mensioning the starter. The starter speed 
and torque characteristics must, rather, 
match the requirements of the engine on 
which it is used. The transmission ratio 
 between the starter pinion and the engine 
crankshaft is therefore used as an addi-
tional matching quantity. It can be varied 
within limits by changing the number of 
teeth on the starter pinion. However, much 
greater scope is offered by the use of an 
 internal reduction gear in the starter 
which allows for broader variation of 
starter-motor characteristics.

Nominal voltage
The nominal voltage of starting systems is 
normally fixed. For cars, it is now univer-
sally 12 V, while for commercial vehicles  
in Europe it is 24 V. In the USA, commer-
cial vehicles also mostly have 12-volt elec-
trical systems. On vans, construction and 
earthmoving vehicles, and small generator 
and marine engines, both 12-volt and  
24-volt systems are common. Stationary 
engines, railway locomotives and special-
ized vehicles can have special systems 
rated 36 to 110 V.

486  |  Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC ranges

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
and interference suppression

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) 
consists of two elements. One is under-
stood as the ability of a device to con-
tinue providing reliable service when ex-
posed to electromagnetism from external 
sources. The second aspect focuses on 
electromagnetic fields generated by the 
same device; these should remain mini-
mal in order to avoid creating interfer-
ence that would impinge upon the qual-
ity of radio reception, etc. in the vicinity.

Today’s vehicle contains a multitude of 
systems whose functions are implemented 
by electrical or electronic components. 
These same functions, if present at all, 
used to be carried out fully or predomi-
nantly mechanically. With the exception  
of two-way transceivers used in special-
purpose applications, a car’s radio was 
once the only device in which signal 
 reception was of any importance. 

In contrast, today’s vehicles feature a 
host of devices that rely on the reception 
of electromagnetic radio waves. Mobile 
phones, navigation systems, theft-deter-
rent systems with radio remote control, 
and integrated fax and PC units are now 
being installed and used in vehicles.  
This trend has led to a commensurate 
 increase in the importance of suppressing 
interference and ensuring reception in  
the vehicle of the operationally vital radio 
waves.

EMC ranges

Transmitter and receiver
All vehicle systems must remain impervi-
ous to electromagnetic radiation emitted 
from such external sources as extremely 
powerful radio transmitters. In other 
words, there must be no threat to the 
 motor vehicle’s operational integrity,  
and malfunctions representing a potential 
source of driver irritation are unaccept-
able. Another consideration is that station-
ary receivers should remain unaffected by 
passing traffic. Both considerations are 
governed by national and international 
codes (EU Directives, German StVZO).

Electrical and electronic components
Motor vehicles contain an extensive array 
of electrical and electronic components 
 including servo and fan motors, solenoid 
valves, electronic sensors and control 
units with microprocessors. These devices 
must rely on a single vehicle electrical 
 system for their power supply. It is thus 
 vital to avoid mutual interference and 
feedback phenomena generated by one  
or several systems so that these do not 
cause malfunction.

On-board electronic systems
Mobile communications equipment –  
such as the radio – also exists within an in-
terlinked environment including all of the 
vehicle’s electronic systems. Every device 
is powered via the same vehicle electrical 
system, and its reception antennas are lo-
cated in the immediate vicinity of potential 
radio-interference sources. These consid-
erations make it imperative that strict lim-
its are imposed on the levels of interfer-
ence emitted by on-board electronic sys-
tems. Compliance with official regulations 
is essential, and it is important to maintain 
interference-free reception in the vehicle 
even when conditions are well below opti-
mal.

EMC between different 
 systems in the vehicle

Shared vehicle electrical system
All of the motor vehicle’s electrical systems 
rely on a single shared vehicle electrical 
system. Because the electric lines leading  
to the individual systems are frequently 
combined within a single wiring harness, 
feedback pulses can easily travel from one 
system to the I/O ports of its neighbor  
(Fig. 1).

This transfer of interference can be in 
the form of signal pulses (abrupt, steep 
jumps in current and voltage) generated 
during the switching on and off of various 
electrical components such as electric 
 motors, solenoid valves and actuators.  
Yet another source is the ignition system’s 
high-tension circuit. Similar to other inter-
ference signals (for instance the ripple  
on the power supply), these signal pulses  
can propagate through the wiring harness. 
These interference pulses then proceed  

to the I/O ports of adjacent systems either 
directly, through shared conductors such 
as the power supply (galvanic coupling),  
or indirectly, through capacitive and in-
ductive coupling stemming from electro-
magnetic emissions.

Galvanic coupling
Currents for two different electric circuits 
(such as a solenoid valve’s trigger loop and 
the electric circuit for assessing sensor 
data) flowing through a single conductive 
path (common ground through the vehicle 
chassis, etc.) will both generate a voltage 
owing to the consistent resistance in the 
shared conductor (Fig. 2a, next page). 
 Continuing with this sample scenario, the 
voltage produced by radio-interference 
source u1 has the effect of a supplementary 
signal voltage in signal circuit 2, and could 
lead to erroneous interpretation of the 
sensor signal. One remedy is to use sepa-
rate return lines for each electric circuit 
(Fig. 2b, next page).

Capacitive coupling
Capacitive coupling allows variable-peri-
odicity signals such as pulse voltages and 
sinusoidal alternating voltages to produce 
interference and crosstalk in adjacent 
electric circuits, even without the exis-
tence of a direct physical link (Fig. 3).  
The potential level of capacitive (interfer-
ence) voltage is proportional to such fac-
tors as the closeness of the neighboring 
conductor paths and the rise rate of the 
pulse-shaped voltage shifts (or the fre-
quency of the alternating voltage). The 
first step is to separate the conductive 
paths while at the same time extending  
the ramp periods during which signals  
rise and fall (or to limit the frequency of 
the alternating voltages to the absolute 
minimum required for the function).

Inductive coupling
Currents recurring with variable periodicity 
in one conductor can induce voltage pulses 
in adjoining circuits. These voltage pulses 
then generate current in the secondary cir-
cuit (Fig. 4). This is the inductive principle 
exploited in transformer design. One prime 
factor defining susceptibility to overcou-
pling is the signal’s rise and fall time (or al-
ternating voltage frequency), reflecting the 
situation encountered with capacitive cou-
pling. Also significant is the effective mutual 
inductance, as determined by such factors  
as the size of the wires and their relative 
routing. Strategies for avoiding inductive 
coupling include minimizing the dimensions 
of circuit wires, keeping critical circuits as 
far apart as possible from each other, and 
the avoidance of parallel conductive paths. 
The tendency toward inductive interference 
is especially pronounced in circuits carrying 
low-frequency signals (e.g. coupling into 
loudspeaker wiring).

Pulsation in the vehicle electrical system
One strategy for dealing with interference 
pulses in the vehicle electrical system 
 entails limiting the amplitude of the inter-
ference emanating from the radio-inter-
ference sources. On the other hand, the 
susceptible devices (affected electronic 
components) are designed for insensitivity 
to pulses of specific shapes and ampli-
tudes. The initial step was to list and clas-
sify the pulses encountered within vehicu-
lar electrical systems (Table 1). Special-
purpose pulse generators can be used  
to generate the test patterns defined in 
 Table 1 as a basis for assessing resistance 
to these interference waves in susceptible 
devices. Both the test pulses and the test 
technology are codified in standards  
(DIN 40 839, Section 1; ISO 7637, Section 1) 
including definitions of the measurement 
technology for evaluating emissions of 
pulse-pattern interference. Classifications 
based on pulse amplitude levels facilitate 
effective definition of radio-interference 
sources and the susceptible devices (inter-
ference receptors) within each vehicle.  
It would thus be possible to specify Class II 
for all of the radio-interference sources 

1 Mutual interference within power supply

within a vehicle while designing all the 
susceptible devices (e.g. control units)  
to comply with and exceed – by a certain 
safety margin – Class III. If suppressing 
 interference at the source proves to be 
cheaper or to involve less technical com-
plexity than reducing sensitivity at the re-
ceptors, the logical response might be to 
shift the definitions to Classes I/II. If the 
scenario is inverted, with the shielding  
of potential susceptible devices as the 
cheaper and simpler solution, then a  
move to Classes III/IV is warranted.

Because numerous wires are combined 
within a single wiring harness, each indi-
vidual conductor is potentially susceptible 
to inductive and capacitive interference. 
Although reduced in intensity, the resulting 
voltage pulses in adjacent supply lines can 
then appear as spurious signals at the in-
put ports and control outputs in neighbor-
ing systems. The test technology for simu-
lating crosstalk interference within wiring 
harnesses (as defined in DIN 40 839, 
 Section 3 and ISO 7637, Section 3) uses  
a standardized substitute wiring layout 
(capacitive clip) with a defined wiring 
 capacitance. Test pulses are fed into this

low-frequency oscillations within vehicu-

producing the desired signals with a signal 
generator and projecting these into the 
wiring harness through a current clamp. 
This process reflects the procedure de-

the correct balance between the amplitude

can stem from periodic switching opera-
tions, as found in high-intensity ignition

nals can induce in mobile communications 
receiver equipment may impair reception 
or even render it impossible.

Spectrum
Pulsation within on-board electrical sys-
tems is usually based on  the analysis of 
current and voltage progressions as func-
tion of time (Fig. 5a). Amplitudes at specific 
frequencies are generally viewed as the 
prime criterion for evaluating interference 
signals affecting radio reception (Fig. 5b). 
Under standard conditions, the interfer-
ence signals encountered in the automotive 
environment are rarely isolated sinusoidal 
waves with single amplitudes recurring at 
consistent frequencies. Much more com-
mon are superimpositions consisting of 
 numerous oscillation components with  
a variety of amplitudes and frequencies. 
The “spectrum” for an interference signal 
is a portrayal of amplitude versus fre-
quency designed to facilitate evaluation of 
inter ference potential in individual wave-
bands (Figs. 6a and 6b). Table 4 (refer to 
section "Interference-suppression catego-
ries") lists the most significant wavebands 
for automotive applications. 

Interference test technology divides 
 interference signals into wide-band and 
narrow-band interference: a spectrum with 
a continuous, progressive curve (Fig. 6a) is 
indicative of wide-band interference, and 
identifies the corresponding radio-inter-
ference source as a wide-band interferer.  
A contrasting pattern composed of isolated 
spikes forming a so-called line spectrum 
 indicates narrow-band interference stem-
ming from narrow-band emitters (Fig. 6b). 
Initially, the classifications in either cat-
egory are arbitrary: among the factors that 
determine whether interference is emanat-
ing from a “wide-band” or “narrow-band” 
radio-interference source are the recep-
tion properties of the potentially suscepti-
ble devices as reflected in the characteris-
tics of the test equipment employed to 
monitor the emissions. 

In the case of radio interference this 
equipment is in the form of a selective 
laboratory receiver or spectral analysis 
unit. Similar to a radio tuner therefore, the 
tester thus measures the signal amplitude 
only within a specific narrow frequency 
band (receiver bandwidth). The test pro-
gresses through the entire relevant fre-
quency range using a procedure analogous 
to the station search function in standard 
radios: while maintaining the initial band-
width, the laboratory receiver proceeds 
through a range of frequen cies, either at 
graduated intervals or in a continuous 
progression. 

Interference signals recurring at fre-
quencies lower than the test bandwidth 
produce the continuous signal pattern 
 indicative of wide-band interference.  
If the frequency is higher than the test 
bandwidth, the test monitor will also pick 
up gaps in the spectrum, and the result  
will be the line spectrum that indicates 
narrow-band interference. 

Electric motors are a typical source of 

wide-band interference. Commutation 
 frequencies in electric motors are located 
around just a few 100 Hz, with the exact 
 figure depending on the motor’s number  
of poles and its speed. At a test bandwidth 
of 120 kHz (bandwidth corresponding to an 
FM radio tuner receiver bandwidth) this 
produces a continuous spectrum. At the 
same test bandwidth, a 2 MHz cycle fre-
quency (of the kind that might be encoun-
tered in a microprocessor-equipped con-
trol unit) will generate a completely differ-
ent spectrum, this time with the spiked line 
spectrum typical of narrow-band interfer-
ence (interference signal recurs at fre-
quency greater than test bandwidth).

While all electric motors – fans, wind-
shield wipers, servo units and fuel-supply 
pump, etc. – join the alternator as typical 
emitters of wide-band interference, yet an-
other potential emitter is the high-tension 
ignition circuit. In addition, low-frequency 
clock signals stemming from devices such 
as switching elements can produce wide-

492  |  Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between different systems in the vehicle

band interference. The list of narrow-band 
interference emitters includes the micro-
processors in control units as well as all 
other devices using high-frequency con-
trol signals.

Interference signals picked up by radio 
 receivers may also be of the so-called con-
ducted interference type, that is they may 
propagate through wiring and conductors 
(such as the radio’s power supply) or they 
can enter the receiver’s I/O ports via in-
ductive and capacitive radiation in the wir-
ing harness. However, interference usually 
enters through the antenna, either through 
coupling in the antenna cable, or because 
the antenna picks up the electromagnetic 
fields generated by radio-interference 
sources. One particularly effective trans-
mission antenna is the wiring harness. 
Other factors influencing the amplitude  
of the interference signals picked-up by 
the receiver are the vehicle-body structure 
and the type and location of the antenna.

laboratory setups and standardized test 
setups in shielded chambers. Interference 
is monitored with a laboratory receiver. 
Line lengths and other geometric dimen-
sions are specified. The power supply 
must be provided by a precisely defined 
vehicle electrical system. Voltage sources 
are also precisely defined, with laboratory 
specimens being powered from simulated 
vehicle electrical systems (Fig. 7).

Interference-suppression categories
Similar to pulsation in the vehicle electri-
cal system, narrow- and wide-band inter-
ference factors are classified by interfer-
ence-suppression category in order to 
 facilitate selection and design for specific 
applications. Within this classification 
 system, demands on sporadically active 
radio-interference sources are less strin-
gent than the requirements placed on 
components in continuous operation,  
such as the alternator. The permissible 
CISPR 25 (DIN/VDE 0879-2) radio interfer-
ence levels are listed in Table 2. Table 3 in-
dicates the permissible interference-field 
strengths for radiation measurements with 
antennas.

Narrow-band interference of the kind 
 generated by CPU clock signals in control 
units poses an especially acute problem 
for radio reception. These interference 
signals are always present (the control 

units are usually switched on along with 
the ignition). Also of significance is the fact 
that the radio receiver cannot distinguish 
these spurious signals from useful signals, 
making reception of weak transmissions 
impossible. This situation is reflected in 
the definition of interference-suppression 
categories. In a given interference-sup-
pression category, narrow-band interfer-
ences are assigned lower permissible in-
terference levels than wide-band interfer-
ences.

Because individual vehicle configuration 
also has a substantial effect on the quality 
of broadcast reception, the interference-
suppression data derived from laboratory 
testing must be confirmed in a practical 
automotive environment. The test involves 
measuring antenna voltage at the end of 
the antenna cable to which the radio re-
ceiver will subsequently be connected. 

CISPR 25 also prescribes limits for radio 

interference voltage as determined using 
this procedure (Table 4). It contains volt-
age levels defined to reflect the unfavor-
able reception conditions as encountered 
in motor vehicles, where the strengths of 
useful signals not only fail to exceed just  
a few mV, but also suffer from substantial 
fluctuation owing to vehicle motion and 
the multiple reception paths generated  
by signal reflections.

Interference from electrostatic charges
ESD, or electrostatic discharge, can dam-
age or even destroy electronic compo-
nents. The voltages produced in the event 
of this discharging can be anywhere up to 
several volts, which in turn also generate 
very high, pulsed currents. For this reason, 
suitable measures are required to prevent 
the destructive effect or, better still, the 
discharges themselves. Electronic compo-
nents that come into contact with vehicle 
passengers are particularly endangered. 

ISO TR 10605 defines test procedures for 
examining the effects of electrostatic dis-
charge and the immunity to interference 
that components exhibit both in the labo-
ratory and when installed in the vehicle. 
The test is conducted with a suitable ESD 
test-pulse generator, usually in the shape 
of a pistol. The generator produces the 
high-voltage pulses that are then coupled 
into the test specimen.

EMC between the vehicle 
and its surroundings

Since early 1996, an official regulation  
has placed mandatory limits on radiation 
by the vehicle of interference affecting 
 stationary radio reception, while at the 
same time defining suppression require-
ments during exposure to external electro-
magnetic fields. This ordinance (European 
 Directive 95/54/EC) superseded an earlier 
directive of more limited scope, which 
only limited interference emissions while 
defining the homologation certification 
procedure governing EMC in motor vehi-
cles.

Emitted interference
Electromagnetic emissions radiated by mo-
tor vehicles must remain within the limits 
for narrow and wide-band signals (Fig. 1)  
to ensure that they do not interfere with 
 radio and television broadcasts or private 
transmissions. These limits are specified in 
the Directive 95/54/EC cited above as well 
as in VDE 0879, Section 1 and the CISPR 12 
standard. These regulations contain de-
tailed descriptions of the test procedure, 
which employs antennas set up at defined 
distances from the vehicle (10 meters,  
3 meters). 

The specifics of the test procedure are 

described in the regulations quoted. 

In practice, it is the ignition system that is 
usually responsible for the greatest amount 
of interference radiation. However, since a 
comprehensive range of measures have 
been taken to ensure good radio reception 
in the vehicle, the emitted interference is 
limited to such an extent that compliance 
with the legal limit values is usually com-
fortably achieved.

Incident radiation 
As a vehicle travels through the high-in-
tensity electromagnetic field (near field) 
immediately surrounding a high-intensity 
emissions source, radiation penetrates 
through gaps and apertures in the vehicle

body and interferes with on-board electri-
cal systems. The intensity of this effect (in-
cident radiation) varies according to com-
ponent locations, body configuration and 
the wiring harness.

Vehicle measurements
At one time the procedure for verifying that 
various electronic systems would continue 
to provide satisfactory performance under 
exposure to high-intensity fields involved 
driving the motor vehicle to a number of 
 different broadcast transmitter locations. 
Now, special test chambers are available  
for this purpose. 

These chambers must be surrounded 
(shielded) with a metallic casing to prevent 
the electromagnetic field generated during 
testing from radiating to the outside. In ad-
dition, the chambers must be equipped with 
absorption materials to inhibit formation 
of standing waves (nodes and antinodes), 
which would lead to major variations in 
field strength between the various measur-
ing points. 

The anechoic chamber is used for investi-
gating the overall performance of vehicle 
electrical systems under real-world oper-
ating conditions. The Bosch anechoic 
chamber (Fig. 2) is equipped with devices 
capable of generating high-frequency 
fields within a frequency range extending 
from 10 kHz to 18 GHz, with a maximum  
field strength of Emax = 200 V/m. Since 
these field strengths represent a health 
hazard, the test vehicle is operated via 
 remote control from within a shielded 
 control room, while testing is monitored 
by video cameras. The chamber is screened 
with metallic sheeting, and non-conduc-
tive materials (wood and plastic) line the 
interior, as metallic substances could 
 foster spurious readings. To prevent reflec-
tions and inhibit the formation of standing 
waves, walls and ceiling are covered by pyr-
amid-shaped absorption elements made of 
graphite-filled polyurethane foam. 

Vehicle testing proceeds on a chassis 
dynamometer (rolling road) capable of 
 accommodating simulated speeds of up to

200 km/h. A fan is also present to direct up 
to 40,000 m3/h (corresponding to a wind 
speed of 80 km/h) of air over the vehicle.
Among the advantages that distinguish 
indoor testing from the old open-air tests 
near transmitters is that the former method 
allows latitude for considerable variations 
in both frequency and field strength. This 
facilitates evaluation of vehicular resis-
tance to incident radiation under a wide 
range of conditions, and not at just a few 
available points. The ability to gradually 
increase field strengths right up to each 
electronic device’s operational limits fur-
nishes information on safety margins. 

Specifics defining the test procedures 
used in determining radiation resistance  
in the overall vehicle are described in  
DIN 40 839, Section 4. ISO 11452, Sec- 
tions 1 – 4 contain similar descriptions as 
elements within a more extensive compila-
tion of special-purpose test procedures.

Laboratory measurements
Although the data garnered from assess-
ments of incident radiation on the vehicle 
as a whole are invaluable, the disadvan-
tage of this type of testing is that it can 
only be performed at an advanced stage  
in the vehicle and electronic system design 
process. Only very limited latitude is avail-
able for responding to indications of inad-
equate resistance to incident radiation un-
covered at this stage. 

This explains the necessity to determine 
at an early stage how an electronic system 
will operate during subsequent use in its 
automotive environment: prompt informa-
tion allows effective recourse to remedial 
action when needed. Various test proce-
dures have emerged for obtaining the re-
quired information.

In the first of the three tests described 

below, interference waves propagating 
through a conductor are coupled into the 
wiring harness of the system under inves-
tigation. As the suitability of these test ar-
rangements for evaluating the frequency 
range beyond > 400 MHz is restricted,  

a different procedure is used for this 
range. The alternate procedure relies on 
antennas to project electromagnetic fields 
into standardized bench setups.

The specifics of the methods outlined 
below are defined in DIN 40 839, Section 4, 
and ISO 11 452, Sections 1 – 7 (which also 
contains additional process descriptions 
detailing less widespread methods).

All these methods furnish a precise pic-

ture of a system’s resistance to incident 
 radiation. This can then be used to imple-
ment improvements while the develop-
ment phase is still in progress. Thanks to 
this inestimable advantage it is now im-
possible to imagine development projects 
without these laboratory measurements  
as flanking measures.

It must be taken into consideration that 
the design of the electrical system in itself 
is not the only important factor. Because 
installation conditions in the vehicle and 
the routing of the wiring harness can also 
exercise a decisive influence on ultimate 
levels of interference resistance, all earlier 
results still need to be confirmed on a pro-
duction vehicle in the anechoic chamber.

Stripline method (Figs. 3 and 4)
The designation, “stripline”, refers to a 
conductor in the form of a strip. This con-
ductor has a length of 4.1 m and a width of 
0.74 m. It is arranged with a clearance of 
0.15 m above the conductive sheet (coun-
ter-electrode). A high-frequency alterna-
tor serves as the source of a transverse 
magnetic wave generated between the 
stripline and the counter-electrode, con-
tinuing until it reaches the terminal resis-
tor. The stripline dimensions have been 
 selected to minimize the likelihood of re-
flections occurring during wave propaga-
tion, thus ensuring constant field-strength 
amplitudes relative to frequency. 

A typical system setup might include a 
control unit, wiring harness and peri- 
pheral devices (sensors and actuators).  
These are set up at a height half way be-

Electromagnetic compatibility  |  EMC between the vehicle and its surroundings  |  497

tween the base plate and the stripline,  
with the wiring harness in alignment with 
the waves’ direction of propagation. 

The field strength between the planes at  
a given frequency is then increased until 
the system malfunctions or until a maxi-
mum specified level is reached. If the in-
crements are small enough, repeating this 
process at progressively altered frequen-
cies will produce a detailed diagram por-
traying resistance to incident radiation as 
a function of frequency (Fig. 4).

Bulk current injection method (Fig. 5)
Bulk current injection (BCI) is an immunity 
test commonly used in the automotive  
and aircraft industry. As with the stripline 
method, the system being tested is ar-
ranged above a conductive sheet (counter-
electrode). A current clamp attached to the 
wiring harness injects transformer current 
into its individual wires. The vectorial sum 
of these currents corresponds to the total 
current radiated by the clamp. While test-
ing using the stripline method proceeds 
through a range of increasing field 
strengths, BCI relies on progressively 
higher current flows as it continues until 
the system malfunctions or until current 
reaches the specified terminal value.

TEM cell (Fig. 6)
As with the stripline method, a transverse 
electromagnetic field (TEM) is generated 
here between a strip conductor and a 
counter-electrode. The TEM counter-elec-
trode, however, is an enclosed housing 
 instead of a metal plate. This leads to an-
other distinguishing feature: TEM test 
benches do not need to be set up within 
specially shielded chambers.

A further difference lies in the fact that 
only the test specimen per se (for example: 
a control unit) is subject to electromag-
netic exposure. The peripheral equipment 
is located outside the TEM cell and is con-
nected to the test specimen via a short 
 wiring harness arranged at right angles  
to the direction of propagation of the 
 electromagnetic waves. 

The measurement procedure is consis-

tent with that of the stripline method. 
Here, too, the field strength is increased 
until the system malfunctions or until a 
maximum specified level is reached.

Incident radiation via antenna
Once again similarities with the stripline 
method are encountered, as the test speci-
men, including control unit, wiring har-
ness and peripherals, is set up on a base 
plate. The wiring harness is laid out at  
a defined distance from this base plate.  
An antenna located at a specified distance 
from this assembly generates an electro-
magnetic field for projection into the en-
tire test setup. Again, field strength is 
raised until the system malfunctions or 
 until field strength reaches the maximum 
value specified for testing. 

Guarantee of immunity and 
interference suppression

As early as the planning and conception 
phases, EMC requirements for immunity  
to and suppression of radio interference 
have to be considered as part of every 
 development project focusing on any elec-
tronic system or component. The finished 
products must incorporate EMC measures 
as an integral design element.

EMC in the electronic control unit (ECU)
The first EMC requirement reflected in  
any ECU is to select microprocessor cycle 
frequencies that are as low as possible 
while simultaneously making every effort 
to keep the signal transit curves as flat as 
possible. EMC characteristics join stan-
dard operational aspects as an essential 
criterion governing the selection of com-
ponents (integrated circuits). Whereas the 
components’ resistance to interference 
must be maximal, its interference emis-
sions should be minimal. On printed-
 circuit boards designed for optimal EMC  
performance, all components with pro-
nounced sensitivity to interference, and  
all of those with the potential to cause it,

are decoupled from the connected wiring 
harness. This is done by locating the com-
ponents as far as possible from the plug 
connections.

Suppression components, usually ca-
pacitors designed for high-frequency ap-
plications, place the required restrictions 
on potentially disruptive interference. 
These interference-suppression capacitors 
are located either directly within the inte-
grated circuits or in the plug-connector 
area. The suppression elements in the 
plug-connector area combine with hous-
ings featuring optimal conductive proper-
ties (shielded casing) to prevent high-fre-
quency radiation in the immediate vicinity 
from reaching the inside of the ECU. This 
ensures that signals produced outside the 
unit do not cause interference inside the 
unit. On the other side of the coin, high-
frequency signals produced inside the unit 
do not cause undesirable interference in 
the surrounding environment. 

Electric motors and other  
electromechanical components 
Standard practice in the design of electric 
motors reflects the procedures used for 
ECUs and sensors by incorporating inter-
ference suppression in the design process 
right from the initial development stages. 
A sample problem is the interference pro-
duced by the brush arcing during current 
reversal in motors with commutator 
 control. This can severely disrupt radio 
 reception. Suitable suppression elements 
(capacitors and throttles) limit the inter-
ference. Motors are designed with optimal 
operation of these interference suppres-
sors in mind.

The voltage pulses produced during 
switching operations in electromagnetic 
actuators are kept to an acceptable level 
by suitable elements, such as quench 
 re sistors, in the circuit.

High-voltage ignition
The ignition system’s high-voltage circuit 
represents a potential source of substan-
tial interference to radio reception.  
One standard solution is to use spark plugs 
and cable sockets with noise-suppression 
resistors. While the resistor element is 
usually located at the end of the ignition 
cables, in modern (multiple-coil) systems 
it can be integrated within the dedicated 
ignition coils plugged directly onto the 
spark plugs for the individual cylinders.  
In using resistors, the object is to find a 
balance between the demand for ignition 
energy and the required level of interfer-
ence suppression. 

Retrofit interference suppression
As made clear in the above sections,  
EMC design considerations must be care-
fully aligned and balanced against opera-
tional requirements. Subsequent remedial 
measures superimposed on the original 
design at a later date usually entail sub-
stantial effort, and should be avoided in 
production vehicles. 

Should the interference-suppression 
measures incorporated in electrical com-
ponents prove inadequate for dealing with 
the conditions encountered in specific ap-
plications (in special-purpose emergency 
vehicles, etc.), supplementary action can 
be implemented to deal with the problem. 
Options include installation of filters as 
well as supplementary shielding for com-
ponents and wiring.

These options should be exercised with 

great care, as field modifications to elec-
tronic components can lead to operational 
malfunctions.

Symbols and circuit diagrams

The electrical systems in vehicles contain 
a wide array of electric and electronic 
devices for open and closed-loop engine-
management systems as well as numer-
ous comfort and convenience systems. 
Only by using expressive symbols and 
circuit diagrams is it possible to provide 
an overview of the complex circuits in 
the vehicle’s electrical system. Circuit, 
schematic and terminal diagrams are a 
help during troubleshooting. They also 
facilitate field installation of accessories, 
and furnish support for trouble-free in-
stallations and modifications on the 
 vehicle’s electrical equipment.

Circuit symbols

The circuit symbols shown in Table 1 are  
a selection of the standardized circuit sym-
bols relevant to automotive electrical sys-
tems. With a few exceptions, they conform 
to the standards of the International Elec-
trotechnical Commission (IEC).

The European Standard EN 60 617 
(Graphical Symbols for Electrical Circuit 
Diagrams) corresponds to the interna-
tional standard IEC 617. It exists in three 
official versions (German, English and

Requirements
Symbols are the smallest components of a 
circuit diagram, and are the simplest way 
to represent electrical devices and their 
component parts. They illustrate how a de-
vice operates, and are used together with 
circuit diagrams to illustrate how technical 
sequences proceed. Symbols do not indi-

cate the shapes and dimensions of the de-
vices they represent, nor do they show the 
locations of their terminal connections. 
This abstract representation format repre-
sents the only practicable option for illus-
trating how the devices are connected us-
ing a circuit diagram.

Every symbol should satisfy the follow-
ing criteria: it must be easy to remember 
and identify, easy to understand, easy to 
draw and should clearly indicate the type 
of device which it represents.

Symbols comprise symbol elements and 

designations (Fig. 2). Designation codes 
can take the form of letters, numbers, 
mathematical and special-purpose sym-
bols, abbreviations of units, characteristic 
curves, etc.

If a circuit diagram showing the internal 
circuitry of a device becomes too complex, 
or if the function of the device can be illus-
trated without showing all of the details, the 
circuit diagram for this specific device can 
be replaced by a single symbol (without in-
ternal circuitry, refer to Figs. 1b and 2).

Simplified representations are usually 
used for integrated circuits, with their typ-
ically high levels of compactness (synony-
mous with high levels of functional inte-
gration within an individual component).

Representation
Symbols show circuits in their passive 
(base) state, unaffected by physical param-
eters such as the application of current, 
voltage or mechanical force. Other operat-
ing states, i.e. any condition that varies 
from the base state defined above, is indi-
cated by a juxtaposed double arrow 
(Fig. 3).

Symbols and connecting lines (electrical 
and mechanical linkage elements) feature 
a single standard line width.

In order to keep the connecting lines as 

straight as possible and to avoid crossed 
lines, symbols can be rotated by 90° incre-
ments or shown as mirror images as long 
as their significance remains unaltered. 
The direction of continuation conductors 
may be freely selected. Tangential connec-
tions may be shown as emerging from any 
convenient point on the symbols; the sole 
exceptions are resistors (connections only 
at the narrow ends) and the terminals for 
electromechanical drives (connections 
only at the long sides, Fig. 4).

Branches may be shown either with or 

without a node point. No electrical con-
nection is made at junctions without a 
node point (Fig. 5). There is no mandatory 
format for illustrating terminals on electri-
cal devices. Terminals, plugs, sockets and 
threaded connections are identified by 
symbols only at those points relevant for 
installation and removal. All other junc-
tions are represented by dots.

In the case of assembled representation, 

actuators with a common drive are illus-
trated as responding to this motive force 
by all moving in the direction indicated by 
the dashed line (– – –) which represents the 
mechanical linkage (Fig. 6).

Circuit diagrams

Circuit diagrams are idealized representa-
tions of electrical devices, rendered in the 
form of symbols. Such diagrams also in-
clude illustrations and simplified design 
drawings as needed (Fig. 7). A circuit dia-
gram illustrates the relationship between 
the various devices and shows how they are 
connected to each other. A circuit diagram 
may be supplemented by tables, graphs, or 
descriptions. Circuit diagrams vary accord-
ing to the intended application (e.g. show-
ing circuit operation) and the selected rep-
resentation mode. A “legible” circuit dia-
gram will meet the following requirements:
▶   The representations must reflect the ap-
plicable standards; explanations should 
be provided for any exceptions

▶   Current paths should be specially ar-

ranged so that current flow or mechani-
cal action takes place from left to right 
and/or from top to bottom

7 Circuit diagrams: breakdown

In automotive electrical systems, block di-
agrams are used to provide a quick over-
view of circuit and device functions. They 
are usually unipolar and also dispense 
with representations of internal circuitry 
components. The circuit diagrams in their 
various permutations (as defined by differ-
ences in symbol arrangements) provide a 
detailed diagram of the circuit. As they il-
lustrate how the circuit operates, they are 
suitable for use as a reference for repair 
operations. The terminal diagram (with 
equipment terminal locations) is used by 
service facilities in replacing defective 
electrical equipment and when installing 
supplementary equipment.

Depending upon the type of representa-

tion, we distinguish between:
▶   Unipolar and multipolar representation
and (according to symbol arrangement)
▶   Assembled representation, semi-assem-
bled representation, detached represen-
tation, and topographical (positionally

correct) representation. One circuit dia-
gram may employ all of the above forms 
of representation.

Block diagram
The block diagram is a simplified represen-
tation of a circuit showing only the most 
significant elements (Fig. 8). It is designed 
to furnish a rapid overview of function, 

structure, layout and operation of an elec-
trical system, or part of it. This format also 
serves as the initial reference for under-
standing more detailed circuit diagrams.

Squares, rectangles and circles together 
with attendant symbols based on EN 60 617, 
Section 2 are employed to illustrate the 
 devices. Wiring is usually shown in single-
pole form.

Circuit diagram
A circuit diagram is the detailed represen-
tation of a circuit. By clearly depicting in-
dividual current paths it also indicates 
how an electrical circuit operates. In the 
circuit diagram, presentation of individual 
circuit components and their spatial rela-
tionship to each other must not interfere 
with the clear, logical and legible presenta-
tion of circuit operation. Figure 9 shows 
the circuit diagram for a starter, in the 
form of assembled (composite) and de-
tached (exploded) representations.

The circuit diagram must contain the fol-
lowing:
▶  Wiring
▶   Device designation (EN 61 346, 

Section 2) 

▶   Connection designation or terminal 

 designation (DIN 72 552)

The circuit diagram may also include:
▶   Comprehensive illustrations including 
internal circuitry, to facilitate testing, 
trouble-shooting, maintenance and 
 replacement (retrofitting)

▶   Reference codes to assist in finding 
 symbols and installation locations, 
 especially in detached representation

Circuit representation
Circuit diagrams usually use multipolar 
component connections. In accordance 
with EN 61 346, Section 1, symbols can be 
represented in the following ways, all of 
which may be combined within the same 
circuit diagram.

Assembled (composite) representation
All parts of a device are shown directly 
next to one another, and mechanical link-
age of one part to another is indicated by  
a double line or broken connecting lines 
(dashes). This format may be employed to 
depict simple circuits of relatively limited 
complexity without unduly hindering 
 clarity (Fig. 9a).

Detached (exploded) representation
Symbols for the elements within electrical 
devices are shown separately in displays 
designed to show with maximum clarity 
the various routes taken by the current.  
No attempt is made to orient the symbols 
for individual devices and component 
parts in their actual spatial relationship  
to each other. Priority is assigned to ar-
ranging the symbols so that the individual 
current paths are as clear and free of 
crossovers as possible.

Primary purpose: to indicate function 

and operation of a circuit.

A system of symbols defined in EN 61 346, 
Section 2 can be used to indicate the rela-
tionships between the individual compo-
nents. Each separately illustrated device 
symbol includes the code for the device.  
If it is necessary in the interests of clarity 
and comprehension, a section of the cir-
cuit diagram should be set aside for the 
complete and assembled representation of 
devices which have otherwise been shown 
in the detached form (Fig. 9b).

Topographical representation
This type of representation places the sym-
bol in a position that completely or partly 
corresponds to its location within the device 
or component.

Ground (earth) symbols
For the sake of conceptual simplicity, most 
vehicles employ a single (hot) conductor 
layout, relying on the metallic body to con-
duct the return current. Designers resort  
to insulated return wiring either when 
 restraints prevent using the body for 
 satisfactory ground connections or when 
voltages in excess of 42 volts are being 
handled.

All terminals represented by the ground

showing connections to ground.

ground. In high-tension circuits this outer 
line is frequently combined with the pro-
tective conductor (PE), also represented as 
a broken dotted line.

Current paths and conductors (wiring)
Circuits should be arranged to be clear and 
easy to follow. When possible, individual 
current paths should indicate a force-trans-
fer direction from left to right and/or from 
top to bottom, as well as being straight and 
free of crossovers and changes in direction. 
They should also be parallel to the border 
of the circuit diagram.

When a number of conductors run par-
allel to each other, they are grouped in sets 
of three with spaces between the groups.

Lines of demarcation, borders
Dot/dash demarcation or border lines are 
used to separate individual components 
within a circuit as an indication of func-
tional and/or structural relationships.

In illustrations of automotive electrical 
systems, these alternating dots and dashes 
represent a non-conductive border around 
a device or circuit component. The line 
will not always correspond with the com-
ponent housing and does not indicate 

Interruptions, codes, destination reference
For clarity, connecting lines (conductors 
and lines denoting mechanical linkage) 
can be interrupted if they would otherwise 
extend too far within the circuit diagram. 
Only beginning and end of the connecting 
line are shown. The association of these 
 interrupted points must be clearly recog-
nizable. The code and / or destination ref-
erence may be used for this.

The codes on associated ends of the open 
circuit match. The following may be used 
as codes:
▶   Terminal designations (DIN 72 552), 

▶   Indication of the function
▶   Identification using alphanumeric

The destination reference is shown in 
 parentheses to avoid confusion with the

Section identification
The section-identification code along the 
upper border of the diagram is used for 
 locating circuit sections. This designation 
can be in one of three forms:
▶   Consecutive numbers at equal intervals 

from left to right (Fig. 12a)

▶   Indication of the content of the circuit 

sections (Fig. 12b)

▶   Or a combination of the two (Fig. 12c).

Designation codes
Devices, parts or symbols are labeled in 
circuit diagrams with a letter and a serial 
number as defined in EN 61 346, Section 2. 
This code is located to the left of or under-
neath the symbol.

The prefix to designate the type of de-
vice (as specified in the standard) can be 
omitted as long as this does not lead to 
 ambiguity.

In nested devices, one device is a com-
ponent part of another, e.g. starter M1 with 
built-in engagement relay K6. The device 
identifier is then: – M1 – K6.

Identification of related symbols in de-
tached views: each individual symbol  
is shown separately and all symbols for  
a particular device are assigned a code 
which is the same as that used for the 
 device itself.

Connection designations (such as those 
defined in DIN 72 552) must be placed out-
side the symbol and, if boundary lines are 
present, outside these lines if possible.

For horizontal current paths: the data 
 associated with the individual symbol is 
provided beneath the circuit symbol con-
cerned. The terminal code is above the 
connecting line, just outside the symbol 
proper.

For vertical current paths: the data ap-

plying to the individual symbol are pro-
vided to its left. The terminal code is just 
outside the symbol. It the type is horizon-
tal, the code is provided next to the con-
necting line on the symbol’s right; if the 
type is vertical, it is on the left.

Terminal diagram
The terminal diagram shows the terminal 
locations of electrical devices. It also illus-
trates the external (and internal as re-
quired) connections (lines) at these points.

Representation
Individual electrical devices are illustrated 
using squares, rectangles, circles, symbols 
or illustrations, and their locations may 
correspond to their installed positions. 
The connections are represented by cir-
cles, dots, plug connectors, or simply by 
the connecting line. The following conven-
tions govern the methods of representa-
tion used in automotive electrical systems:
▶   Assembled, circuit symbols complying 

with EN 60 617 (Fig. 13a)

▶   Assembled, pictorial representation of 

the device (Fig. 13b)

▶   Detached, representation of the device 
with symbol, terminals with destination 
references; wiring color codes optional 
(Fig. 14a and Table 2)

Devices identified in accordance with  
EN 61 346, Section 2. Terminal connectors

the device (Fig. 13).

Detached views dispense with continu-
ous connecting lines between devices. All 
conductors leaving a device have a desti-
nation reference (EN 61 346, Section 2), 
consisting of the code for the target device 
and the terminal designation with – if nec-
essary – statement of the wiring color code 
as specified in DIN 47 002 (Fig. 15 and

Block diagram
Bosch has responded to the requirements 
associated with trouble-shooting on 
complex, networked systems with a self-
diagnosis function by developing system-
specific circuit diagrams. Bosch makes 
block diagrams for further systems in a 
great number of motor vehicles available 
in ESI[tronic] (Electronic Service Informa-
tion). This provides automotive repair 
shops with a useful tool for locating faults 
or wiring retrofit equipment. Figure 17 
shows the block diagram for a door-lock-
ing system.

The representations in the block dia-
grams diverge from those in the standard 
circuit diagrams by relying on US symbols 
with supplementary legends (Fig. 16). 
These legends include component codes 
(for instance: “A28” for theft-deterrence 
system), as shown in Table 3, as well as 
the color codes for wiring (Table 4). Both 
tables can be accessed in ESI[tronic].

Block diagrams are classified according 
to system circuits, with further divisions 
by subsystem as indicated (Table 5). Clas-
sification of system circuits reflects the 
standard ESI[tronic] practice as used for 
other systems, according to which they are 
assigned to one of four assembly groups:
▶   Engine
▶   Body

▶   Suspension and 
▶   Drivetrain

It is important to be aware of the ground-
ing points, particularly when fitting ad-
ditional accessories. For this reason, 
ESI[tronic] includes the vehicle-specific 
location diagram for the grounding points 
(Fig. 18) in addition to the block diagrams.

Terminal designations

The system of standard (DIN 72 552) termi-
nal designations prescribed for use in au-
tomotive applications has been designed 
to facilitate correct connection of devices 
and their wiring, with emphasis on repairs 
and replacement.

The terminal designations (Table 7) are 
not wire designations, as devices with dif-
fering terminal codes can be connected to 
the opposite ends of a single wire.

For this reason, the terminal designations 
need not be written on the wires.

In addition to the terminal designations 
listed, designations according to DIN VDE 
standards may also be used on electri-
cal machines. Multi-pin plug connections 
large enough to exhaust the range pro-
vided by DIN 72 552 are allocated consecu-
tive numbers or letters, avoiding any char-
acters to which the standard has already 
assigned a specific function.
