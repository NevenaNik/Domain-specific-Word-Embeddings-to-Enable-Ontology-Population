Rudolf Diesel

History of the diesel engine

As early as 1863, the Frenchman Etienne
Lenoir had test-driven a vehicle which was
powered by a gas engine which he had 
developed. However, this drive plant proved
to be unsuitable for installing in and driving
vehicles. It was not until Nikolaus August
Otto’s four-stroke engine with magneto 
ignition that operation with liquid fuel and
thereby mobile application were made 
possible. But the efficiency of these engines 
was low. Rudolf Diesel’s achievement was 
to theoretically develop an engine with 
comparatively much higher efficiency and 
to pursue his idea through to readiness for
series production.

In 1897, in cooperation with Maschinen -
fabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg (MAN), Rudolf
Diesel built the first working prototype of a
combustion engine to be run on inexpensive
heavy fuel oil. However, this first diesel engine
weighed approximately 4.5 tonnes and was
three meters high. For this reason, this engine
was not yet considered for use in land 
vehicles.

spect of the ideal engine. The maximum 
pressure was reduced from 250 to 90 bar, 
and then later to 30 bar. This lowering of the
pressure, required for mechanical reasons,
naturally had a disadvantageous effect on
combustibility. Diesel’s initial plans to use
coal dust as the fuel were rejected.

Finally, in Spring 1893, MAN began 
to build the first, uncooled test engine.
Kerosene was initially envisaged as the fuel,
but what came to be used was gasoline,
 because it was thought (erroneously) that 
this fuel would auto-ignite more easily. 
The principle of auto-ignition – i.e. injection
of the fuel into the highly compressed and
heated combustion air during compression –
was confirmed in this engine.

In the second test engine, the fuel was not
injected and atomized directly, but with the
aid of compressed air. The engine was also
provided with a water-cooling system.

It was not until the third test engine – a
new design with a single-stage air pump for
compressed-air injection – that the break-
through made. On 17 February 1897, Profes-
sor Moritz Schröder of Munich Technical
University carried out the acceptance tests.
The test results confirmed what was then 
for a combustion engine a high level of effi-
ciency of 26.2%.

Patent disputes and arguments with the
Diesel consortium with regard to develop-
ment strategy and failures took their toll,
both mentally and physically, on the brilliant
inventor. He is thought to have fallen over-
board on a Channel crossing to England on
29 September 1913.

Rudolf Diesel

Rudolf Diesel (1858–1913), born in Paris, de-
cided at 14 that he wanted to become an engi-
neer. He passed his final examinations 
at Munich Polytechnic with the best grades
achieved up to that point.

Idea for a new engine
Diesel’s idea was to design an engine with sig-
nificantly greater efficiency than the steam
engine, which was popular at the time. An en-
gine based on the isothermal  cycle should, ac-
cording to the theory of the French physicist
Sadi Carnot, be able to be operated with a
high level of efficiency of over 90%. 

Diesel developed his engine initially on pa-
per, based on Carnot’s models. His aim was to
design a powerful engine with comparatively
small dimensions. Diesel was  absolutely con-
vinced by the function and power of his en-
gine.

Diesel’s patent
Diesel completed his theoretical studies in
1890 and on 27 February 1892 applied to 
the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin for a
patent on “New rational thermal engines”. On
23 February 1893, he received patent docu-
ment DRP 67207 entitled “Operating Process
and Type of Construction for Combustion
Engines”, dated 28 February 1892.

This new engine initially only existed on
paper. The accuracy of Diesel’s calculations
had been verified repeatedly, but the engine
manufacturers remained skeptical about the
engine’s technical feasibility. 

Realizing the engine
The companies experienced in engine build-
ing, such as Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz AG,
shied away from the Diesel project. The re-
quired compression pressures of 250 bar were
beyond what appeared to be technically feasi-
ble. In 1893, after many months of endeavor,
Diesel finally succeeded in reaching an agree-
ment to work with Maschinenfabrik Augs-
burg-Nürnberg (MAN). However, the agree-
ment contained concessions by Diesel in re-

Compressed-air injection
Rudolf Diesel did not have the opportunity to
compress the fuel to the pressures required
for spray dispersion, spray disintegration 
and droplet formation. The first diesel engine
from 1897 therefore worked with com-
pressed-air injection, whereby the fuel was 
introduced into the cylinder with the aid of
compressed air. This process was later used by
Daimler in its diesel engines for trucks.

The fuel injector had a port for the com-
pressed-air feed (Fig. 1, 1) and a port for the
fuel feed (2). A compressor generated the
compressed air, which flowed into the valve.
When the nozzle (3) was open, the air blast-
ing into the combustion chamber also swept
the fuel in and in this two-phase flow gener-
ated the fine droplets required for fast droplet
vaporization and thus for auto- ignition. 

A cam ensured that the nozzle was actuated

in synchronization with the crankshaft. The
amount of fuel to be injected as controlled by
the fuel pressure. Since the injection pressure
was generated by the compressed air, a low fuel
pressure was sufficient to ensure the efficacy of
the process.

The problem with this process was – on 
account of the low pressure at the nozzle –
the low penetration depth of the air/fuel mix-
ture into the combustion chamber. This type
of mixture formation was therefore not suit-
able for higher injected fuel quantities (higher
engine loads) and engine speeds. The limited
spray dispersion prevented the amount of 
air utilization required to increase power 
and, with increasing injected fuel quantity, 
resulted in local over-enrichment with a 
drastic increase in the levels of smoke. 
Furthermore, the vaporization time of the
relatively large fuel droplets did not permit
any significant increase in engine speed. 
Another disadvantage of this engine was the
enormous amount of space taken up by the
compressor. Nevertheless, this principle was
used in trucks at that time.

Precombustion-chamber engine
The Benz diesel was a precombustion-cham-
ber engine. Prosper L’Orange had already 
applied for a patent on this process in 1909.
Thanks to the precombustion-chamber 
principle, it was possible to dispense with the
complicated and expensive system of air in-
jection. Mixture formation in the main com-
bustion chamber of this process, which is still

History of the diesel engine

Mixture formation in the first diesel engines, use of the first vehicle diesel engines

used to this day, is ensured by partial com-
bustion in the precombustion chamber. The
precombustion-chamber engine has a spe-
cially shaped combustion chamber with 
a hemispherical head. The precombustion
chamber and combustion chamber are inter-
connected by small bores. The volume of the
precombustion chamber is roughly one fifth
of the compression chamber. 

The entire quantity of fuel is injected at 
approximately 230 to 250 bar into the pre-
combustion chamber. Because of the limited
amount of air in the precombustion chamber,
only a small amount of the fuel is able to
combust. As a result of the pressure increase
in the precombustion chamber caused by the
partial combustion, the unburned or partially
cracked fuel is forced into the main combus-
tion chamber, where it mixes with the air in
the main combustion chamber,  ignites and
burns. 

The function of the precombustion cham-
ber here is to form the mixture. This process
– also known as indirect injection – finally
caught on and remained the predominant
process until developments in fuel injection
were able to deliver the injection pressures 
required to form the mixture in the main
combustion chamber. 

Direct injection
The first MAN diesel engine operated with
direct injection, whereby the fuel was forced
directly into the combustion chamber via 
a nozzle. This engine used as its fuel a very
light oil, which was injected by a compressor
into the combustion chamber. The compres-
sor determined the huge dimensions of the
engine.

In the commercial-vehicle sector, direct-in-

jection engines resurfaced in the 1960s and
gradually superseded precombustion-cham-
ber engines. Passenger cars continued to use
precombustion-chamber engines  because of
their lower combustion-noise levels until the
1990s, when they were swiftly superseded by
direct-injection engines.

Use of the first vehicle 
diesel engines

Diesel engines in commercial vehicles
Because of their high cylinder pressures, 
the first diesel engines were large and heavy
and therefore wholly unsuitable for mobile
applications in vehicles. It was not until the
 beginning of the 1920s that the first diesel en-
gines were able to be deployed in commercial
vehicles.

Uninterrupted by the First World War,
Prosper L’Orange – a member of the execu-
tive board of Benz & Cie – continued his
 development work on the diesel engine. In
1923 the first diesel engines for road vehicles
were installed in five-tonne trucks. These
four-cylinder precombustion-chamber en-
gines with a piston displacement of 8.8 l de-
livered 45...50 bhp. The first test drive of the
Benz truck took place on 10 September with
brown-coal tar oil serving as the fuel. Fuel
consumption was 25% lower than benzene
engines. Furthermore, operating fluids such
as brown-coal tar oil cost much less than ben-
zene, which was highly taxed.

The company Daimler was already involved in
the development of the diesel engine prior to

the First World War. After the end of the war,
the company was working on diesel engines
for commercial vehicles. The first test drive
was conducted on 23 August 1923 – at 
virtually the same time as the Benz truck. At
the end of September 1923, a further test drive
was conducted from the Daimler plant in
Berlin to Stuttgart and back. 

The first truck production models with diesel
engines were exhibited at the Berlin Motor
Show in 1924. Three manufacturers were 
represented, each with different systems, 
having driven development of the diesel 
forward with their own ideas:
(cid:0) The Daimler diesel engine with com-

pressed-air injection 

(cid:0) The Benz diesel with precombustion 

(cid:0) The MAN diesel engine with direct 

chamber 

injection

Diesel engines became increasingly powerful
with time. The first types were four-cylinder
units with a power output of 40 bhp. By 1928,
engine power-output figures of more than
60 bhp were no longer unusual. Finally, even
more powerful engines with six and eight
cylinders were being produced for heavy

commercial vehicles. By 1932, the power
range stretched up to 140 bhp.

The diesel engine’s breakthrough came in
1932 with a range of trucks offered by the
company Daimler-Benz, which came into 
being in 1926 with the merger of the auto-
mobile manufacturers Daimler and Benz.
This range was led by the Lo2000 model 
with a payload of 2 t and a permissible total
weight of almost 5 t. It housed the OM59
four-cylinder engine with a displacement 
of 3.8 l and 55 bhp. The range extended up 
to the L5000 (payload 5 t, permissible total
weight 10.8 t). All the vehicles were also 
available with gasoline engines of identical
power output, but these engines proved un-
successful when up against the economical
diesel engines.

To this day, the diesel engine has maintained
its dominant position in the commercial-
vehicle sector on account of its economic 
efficiency. Virtually all heavy goods vehicles
are driven by diesel engines. In Japan, large-
displacement conventionally aspirated en-
gines are used almost exclusively. In the USA
and Europe, however, turbocharged engines
with charge-air cooling are favored.

 beginning of the 20th century, the diesel en-
gine also emerged as the drive source for this
mode of transport. The first ship to be fitted
with a 25-bhp diesel engine was launched in
1903. The first locomotive to be driven by a
diesel engine started service in 1913. The en-
gine power output in this case was 1,000 bhp.
Even the pioneers of aviation showed interest
in the diesel engine. Diesel engines provided
the propulsion on board the Graf  Zeppelin
airship.

Diesel engines in passenger cars
A few more years were to pass before the
diesel engine made its debut in a passenger
car. 1936 was the year, when the Mercedes
260D appeared with a four-cylinder diesel 
engine and a power output of 45 bhp.

The diesel engine as the power plant for
passenger cars was long relegated to a fringe
existence. It was too sluggish when compared
with the gasoline engine. Its image was to
change only in the 1990s. With exhaust-gas
turbocharging and new high-pressure fuel-
injection systems, the diesel engine is now on
an equal footing with its gasoline counterpart.
Power output and environmental perfor-
mance are comparable. Because the diesel 
engine, unlike its gasoline counterpart, does
not knock, it can also be turbocharged in the
lower speed range, which results in high
torque and very good driving performance.
Another advantage of the diesel engine is, 
naturally, its excellent efficiency. This has led
to it becoming increasingly accepted among
car drivers – in Europe, roughly every second
newly registered car is a diesel.

tion for diesel engines were fuel-injection
pumps and nozzles.

Even Rudolf Diesel had wanted to inject
the fuel directly, but was unable to do this be-
cause the fuel-injection pumps and nozzles
needed to achieve this were not available.
These pumps, in contrast to the fuel pumps
used in compressed-air injection, had to be
suitable for back-pressure reactions of up to
several hundred atmospheres. The nozzles
had to have quite fine outlet openings be-
cause now the task fell upon the pump and
the nozzle alone to meter and  atomize the
fuel.

The injection pumps which Bosch wanted

to develop should match not only the re-
quirements of all the heavy-oil low-power 
engines with direct fuel injection which 
existed at the time but also future motor-
vehicle diesel engines. On 28 December 1922,
the decision was taken to embark on this
 development.

Demands on the fuel-injection pumps
The fuel-injection pump to be developed
should be capable of injecting even small
amounts of fuel with only quite small differ-
ences in the individual pump elements. 
This would facilitate smoother and more 
uniform engine operation even at low idle
speeds. For full-load requirements, the 
delivery quantity would have to be increased
by a factor of four or five. The required injec-
tion pressures were at that time already over
100 bar. Bosch demanded that these pump
properties be guaranteed over 2,000 operat-
ing hours.

These were exacting demands for the then

state-of-the-art technology. Not only did
some feats of fluid engineering have to be
achieved, but also this requirement repre-
sented a challenge in terms of production 
engineering and materials application tech-
nology.

Bosch’s emergence onto the diesel-tech-
nology stage
In 1886, Robert Bosch (1861–1942) opened a
“workshop for light and electrical engineer-
ing” in Stuttgart. He employed one other me-
chanic and an apprentice. At the beginning,
his field of work lay in installing and repair-
ing telephones, telegraphs, lightning conduc-
tors, and other light-engineering jobs.

The low-voltage magneto-ignition system

developed by Bosch had provided reliable 
ignition in gasoline engines since 1897. 
This product was the launching board for the
rapid expansion of Robert Bosch’s business.
The high-voltage magneto ignition  system
with spark plug followed in 1902. The 
armature of this ignition system is  still to 
this day incorporated in the logo of Robert
Bosch GmbH.

In 1922, Robert Bosch turned his attention
to the diesel engine. He believed that certain
accessory parts for these engines could simi-
larly make suitable objects for Bosch high-
volume precision production like magnetos
and spark plugs. The accessory parts in ques-

Development of the fuel-injection pump
Firstly, different pump designs were tried out.
Some pumps were spool-controlled, while
others were valve-controlled. The injected
fuel quantity was regulated by altering the
plunger lift. By the end of 1924, a pump 
design was available which, in terms of its 
delivery rate, its durability and its low space
requirement, satisfied the demands both of
the Benz precombustion-chamber engine
presented at the Berlin Motor Show and of
the MAN direct-injection engine.

In March 1925, Bosch concluded contracts
with Acro AG to utilize the Acro patents on a
diesel-engine system with air chamber and
the associated injection pump and nozzle.
The Acro pump, developed by Franz Lang in
Munich, was a unique fuel- injection pump. 
It had a special valve spool with helix, which
was rotated to regulate the delivery quantity.
Lang later moved this helix to the pump
plunger.

The delivery properties of the Acro injection
pump did not match what Bosch’s own test
pumps had offered. However, with the Acro
engine, Bosch wanted to come into contact
with a diesel engine which was particularly
suitable for small cylinder units and high
speeds and in this way gain a firm foothold
for developing injection pumps and nozzles.
At the same time, Bosch was led by the idea 
of granting licenses in the Acro patents to 
engine factories to promote the spread of the
vehicle diesel engine and thereby contribute
to the motorization of traffic.

After Lang’s departure from the company

in October 1926, the focus of activity at
Bosch was again directed toward pump
 development. The first Bosch diesel fuel-
 injection pump ready for series production
appeared soon afterwards.

History of the diesel engine

Bosch diesel fuel injection

Bosch diesel fuel-injection pump ready
for series production
In accordance with the design engineer’s
plans of 1925 and like the modified Acro
pump, the Bosch fuel-injection pump fea-
tured a diagonal helix on the pump plunger.
Apart from this, however, it differed signifi-
cantly from all its predecessors. 

The external lever apparatus of the Acro

pump for rotating the pump plunger was
 replaced by the toothed control rack, which
engaged in pinions on control sleeves of the
pump elements. 

In order to relieve the load on the pressure
line at the end of the injection process and to
prevent fuel dribble, the delivery valve was
provided with a suction plunger adjusted to
fit in the valve guide. In contrast to the load-
relieving techniques previously used, this new
approach achieved increased steadiness of de-
livery at different speeds and quantity settings
and significantly simplified and shortened the

adjustment of multicylinder pumps to identi-
cal delivery by all elements.

The pump’s simple and clear design made
it easier to assemble and test. It also signifi-
cantly simplified the replacement of parts
compared with earlier designs. The housing
conformed first and foremost to the require-
ments of the foundry and other manufactur-
ing processes. The first specimens of this
Bosch fuel-injection pump really suitable for
volume production were manufactured in
April 1927. Release for production in greater
batch quantities and in versions for two-,
four- and six-cylinder engines was granted 
on 30 November 1927 after the specimens
had passed stringent tests at Bosch and in
practical operation with flying colors.

Nozzles and nozzle holders
The development of nozzles and nozzle 
holders was conducted in parallel to pump
development. Initially, pintle nozzles were
used for precombustion-chamber engines.
Hole-type nozzles were added at the start 
of 1929 with the introduction of the Bosch
pump in the direct-injection diesel engine.

The nozzles and nozzle holders were always

adapted in terms of their size to the new
pump sizes. It was not long before the engine
manufacturers also wanted a nozzle holder
and nozzle which could be screwed into the
cylinder head in the same way as the spark
plug on a gasoline engine. Bosch adapted to
this request and started to produce screw-in
nozzle holders.

Governor for the fuel-injection pump
Because a diesel engine is not self-governing
like a gasoline engine, but needs a governor to
maintain a specific speed and to provide pro-
tection against overspeed accompanied by
self-destruction, vehicle diesel engines had to
be equipped with such devices right from the
start. The engine factories initially manufac-
tured these governors themselves. However,
the request soon came to dispense with the
drive for the governor, which was without 
exception a mechanical governor, and to
combine it with the injection pump. Bosch
complied with this request in 1931 with the
introduction of the Bosch governor.

Spread of Bosch diesel fuel-injection
technology
By August 1928, one thousand Bosch fuel-in-
jection pumps had already been supplied.
When the upturn in the fortunes of the
 vehicle diesel engine began, Bosch was well
prepared and fully able to serve the engine
factories with a full range of fuel-injection
equipment. When the Bosch pumps and noz-
zles proved their worth, most companies saw
no further need to continue manufacturing
their own accessories in this field. 

Bosch’s expertise in light engineering (e.g., 
in the manufacture of lubricating pumps)
stood it in good stead in the development 
of diesel fuel-injection pumps. Its products
could not be manufactured “in accordance
with the pure principles of mechanical 
engineering”. This helped Bosch to obtain a
market advantage. Bosch had thus made a
significant contribution towards enabling the
diesel engine to develop into what it is today.

Areas of use for diesel engines

Suitability criteria, applications

Areas of use for diesel engines

No other internal-combustion engine is as
widely used as the diesel engine 1). This is
due primarily to its high degree of efficiency
and the resulting fuel economy.

The chief areas of use for diesel engines are
(cid:0) Fixed-installation engines
(cid:0) Cars and light commercial vehicles
(cid:0) Heavy goods vehicles
(cid:0) Construction and agricultural machinery
(cid:0) Railway locomotives and
(cid:0) Ships

Diesel engines are produced as inline or 
V-configuration units. They are ideally suited
to turbocharger or supercharger aspiration as
– unlike the gasoline engine – they are not
susceptible to knocking (refer to the chapter
“Cylinder-charge control systems”).

Suitability criteria

The following features and characteristics 
are significant for diesel-engine applications
(examples):
(cid:0) Engine power
(cid:0) Specific power output
(cid:0) Operational safety
(cid:0) Production costs
(cid:0) Economy of operation
(cid:0) Reliability
(cid:0) Environmental compatibility
(cid:0) User-friendliness
(cid:0) Convenience (e.g. engine-compartment 

design)

The relative importance of these characteris-
tics affect engine design and vary according to
the type of application.

 however, before the first functional diesel engine was
 produced at MAN in Augsburg in 1897.

for operation at that speed. An engine gover-
nor adjusts the quantity of fuel injected de-
pendent on engine load. For this type of
 application, mechanically governed fuel-
 injection systems are still used.

Cars use fast-running diesel engines capable
of speeds up to 5,500 rpm. The range of sizes
extends from 10-cylinder 5-liter units used in
large saloons to 3-cylinder 800-cc models for
small subcompacts.

Car and commercial-vehicle engines can also
be used as fixed-installation engines. How-
ever, the engine-control system may have to
be modified to suit the different  conditions.

Cars and light commercial vehicles
Car engines (Fig. 1) in particular are  expected
to produce high torque and run smoothly.
Great progress has been made in these areas
by refinements in engine design and the de-
velopment of new fuel-injection with Elec-
tronic Diesel Control (EDC). These advances
have paved the way for substantial improve-
ments in the power output and torque char-
acteristics of diesel engines since the early
1990s. And as a result, the diesel engine has
forced its way into the executive and luxury-
car markets.

In Europe, all new diesel engines are now
 Direct-Injection (DI) designs as they offer
fuel consumption reductions of 15 to 20% in
comparison with indirect-injection engines.
Such engines, now almost exclusively fitted
with turbochargers, offer considerably better
torque characteristics than comparable gaso-
line engines. The maximum torque available
to a vehicle is generally determined not by the
engine but by the power-transmission system.

The ever more stringent emission limits im-
posed and continually increasing power de-
mands require fuel-injection systems with ex-
tremely high injection pressures. Improving
emission characteristics will continue to be a
major challenge for diesel-engine developers
in the future. Consequently, further innova-
tions can be expected in the area of exhaust-
gas treatment in years to come.

Areas of use for diesel engines

Applications

Heavy goods vehicles
The prime requirement for engines for heavy
goods vehicles (Fig. 2) is economy. That is
why diesel engines for this type of application
are exclusively direct-injection (DI) designs.
They are generally medium-fast engines that
run at speeds of up to 3,500 rpm.

For large commercial vehicles too, the emis-
sion limits are continually being lowered.
That means exacting demands on the fuel-
injection system used and a need to develop
new emission-control systems.

Construction and agricultural machinery
Construction and agricultural machinery is
the traditional domain of the diesel engine.
The design of engines for such applications
places particular emphasis not only on econ-
omy but also on durability, reliability and
ease of maintenance. Maximizing power
 utilization and minimizing noise output 
are less important considerations than they
would be for car engines, for example. 
For this type of use, power outputs can range
from around 3 kW to the equivalent of HGV
engines.

Many engines used in construction-industry
and agricultural machines still have mechani-
cally governed fuel-injection systems. In con-
trast with all other areas of application, where
water-cooled engines are the norm, the
ruggedness and simplicity of the air-cooled
engine remain important factors in the build-
ing and farming industries.

Railway locomotives
Locomotive engines, like heavy-duty marine
diesel engines, are designed primarily with
continuous-duty considerations in mind. 
In addition, they often have to cope with
poorer quality diesel fuel. In terms of size,
they range from the equivalent of a large
truck engine to that of a medium-sized
 marine engine.

Ships
The demands placed on marine engines vary
considerably according to the particular type
of application. There are out-and-out high-
performance engines for fast naval vessels or
speedboats, for example. These tend to be 
4-stroke medium-fast engines that run at
speeds of 400...1,500 rpm and have up to
24 cylinders (Fig. 3). At the other end of

the scale there are 2-stroke heavy-duty
 engines designed for maximum economy 
in continuous duty. Such slow-running 
engines (< 300 rpm) achieve effective levels 
of efficiency of up to 55%, which represent
the highest attainable with piston engines.

Large-scale engines are generally run on
cheap heavy oil. This requires pretreatment of
the fuel on board. Depending on quality, it
has to be heated to temperatures as high as
160°C. Only then is its viscosity reduced to a
level at which it can be filtered and pumped.

Smaller vessels often use engines originally
intended for large commercial vehicles. 
In that way, an economical propulsion unit
with low development costs can be produced.
Once again, however, the engine management
system has to be adapted to the different 
service profile.

Multi-fuel engines
For specialized applications (such as 
operation in regions with undeveloped infra-
structures or for military use), diesel engines
capable of running on a variety of different
 fuels including diesel, gasoline and others
have been developed. At present they are of
virtually no significance whatsoever within
the overall picture, as they are incapable of
meeting the current demands in respect of
emissions and performance characteristics.

Engine characteristic data

Table 1 shows the most important compari-
son data for various types of diesel and 
gasoline engine.

The average pressure in petrol engines with

direct fuel injection is around 10%
higher than for the engines listed in the table
with inlet-manifold injection. At the same
time, the specific fuel consumption is up to
25% lower. The compression ratio of such 
engines can be as much as 13:1.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Method of operation

Basic principles of the diesel engine

The diesel engine is a compression-ignition
engine in which the fuel and air are mixed in-
side the engine. The air required for combus-
tion is highly compressed inside the combus-
tion chamber. This generates high tempera-
tures which are sufficient for the diesel fuel
to spontaneously ignite when it is injected
into the cylinder. The diesel engine thus uses
heat to release the chemical energy contained
within the diesel fuel and convert it into me-
chanical force.

The diesel engine is the internal-combustion
engine that offers the greatest overall effi-
ciency (more than 50% in the case of large,
slow-running types). The associated low fuel
consumption, its low-emission exhaust and
quieter running characteristics assisted, for 
example, by pre-injection have combined to
give the diesel engine its present significance.

Diesel engines are particularly suited to aspira-
tion by means of a turbocharger or super-
charger. This not only improves the engine’s
power yield and efficiency, it also reduces pollu-
tant emissions and combustion noise.

In order to reduce NOx emissions on cars and
commercial vehicles, a proportion of the ex-
haust gas is fed back into the engine’s intake

manifold (exhaust-gas recirculation). An even
greater reduction of NOx emissions can be
achieved by cooling the recirculated exhaust
gas.

Diesel engines may operate either as two-
stroke or four-stroke engines. The types used
in motor vehicles are generally four-stroke
designs.

Method of operation

A diesel engine contains one or more cylin-
ders. Driven by the combustion of the air/fuel
mixture, the piston (Fig. 1, 3) in each cylinder
(5) performs up-and-down movements. This
method of operation is why it was named the
“reciprocating-piston engine”.

The connecting rod, or conrod (11), converts
the linear reciprocating action of the piston
into rotational movement on the part of the
crankshaft (14). A flywheel (15) connected 
to the end of the crankshaft helps to maintain
continuous crankshaft rotation and reduce 
unevenness of rotation caused by the periodic
nature of fuel combustion in the individual
cylinders. The speed of rotation of the crank-
shaft is also referred to as engine speed.

Four-stroke cycle
On a four-stroke diesel engine (Fig. 2), inlet
and exhaust valves control the intake of air
and expulsion of burned gases after com-
bustion. They open and close the cylinder’s
inlet and exhaust ports. Each inlet and ex-
haust port may have one or two valves.

1. Induction stroke (a)
Starting from Top Dead Center (TDC), the
piston (6) moves downwards increasing the
capacity of the cylinder. At the same time
the inlet valve (3) is opened and air is drawn
into the cylinder without restriction by a
throttle valve. When the piston reaches
 Bottom Dead Center (BDC), the cylinder
capacity is at its greatest (Vh+Vc).

2. Compression stroke (b)
The inlet and exhaust valves are now closed.
The piston moves upwards and compresses
the air trapped inside the cylinder to the de-
gree determined by the engine’s compression
ratio (this can vary from 6 : 1 in large-scale
engines to 24 : 1 in car engines). In the pro -
cess, the air heats up to temperatures as high
as 900°C. When the compression stroke is
 almost complete, the fuel-injection system
injects fuel at high pressure (as much as
2,000 bar in modern engines) into the hot,
compressed air. When the piston reaches 
top dead center, the cylinder capacity is at 
its smallest (compression volume, Vc).

3. Ignition stroke (c)
After the ignition lag (a few degrees of
crankshaft rotation) has elapsed, the igni-
tion stroke (working cycle) begins. The
finely atomized and easily combustible
diesel fuel spontaneously ignites and burns
due to the heat of the compressed air in the
combustion chamber (5). As a result, the
cylinder charge heats up even more and the
pressure in the cylinder rises further as well.
The amount of energy released by combus-
tion is essentially determined by the mass 
of fuel injected (quality-based control).  
The pressure forces the  piston downwards.
The chemical energy  released by combustion
is thus converted into kinetic energy. The
crankshaft drive translates the piston’s
 kinetic energy into a turning force (torque)
available at the crankshaft.

4. Exhaust stroke (d)
Fractionally before the piston reaches bot-
tom dead center, the exhaust valve (4) opens.
The hot, pressurized gases flow out of the
cylinder. As the piston moves upwards again,
it forces the remaining exhaust gases out.

On completion of the exhaust stroke, the
crankshaft has completed two revolutions
and the four-stroke operating cycle starts
again with the induction stroke.

18

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Method of operation

Valve timing
The cams on the inlet and exhaust camshafts
open and close the inlet and exhaust valves
respectively. On engines with a single cam -
shaft, a rocker-arm mechanism transmits the
action of the cams to the valves.

Valve timing involves synchronizing the
opening and closing of the valves with the 
rotation of the crankshaft (Fig. 4). For that
reason, valve timing is specified in  degrees 
of crankshaft rotation.

The crankshaft drives the camshaft by means
of a toothed belt or a chain (the timing belt
or timing chain) or sometimes by a series of
gears. On a four-stroke engine, a complete
operating cycle takes two revolutions of the
crankshaft. Therefore, the speed of rotation of
the camshaft is only half that of the crank-
shaft. The transmission ratio  between the
crankshaft and the camshaft is thus 2 : 1.

At the changeover from exhaust to induction
stroke, the inlet and exhaust valves are open
simultaneously for a certain period of time.
This “valve overlap” helps to “flush out” the
remaining exhaust and cool the cylinders.

Compression
The compression ratio, ε, of a cylinder  results
from its swept volume, Vh, and its compres-
sion volume, Vc, thus:

ε =

Vh + Vc
Vc

The compression ratio of an engine has 
a decisive effect on the following:
(cid:1) The engine’s cold-starting characteristics
(cid:1) The torque generated
(cid:1) Its fuel consumption
(cid:1) How noisy it is and
(cid:1) The pollutant emissions

The compression ratio, ε, is generally between
16:1 and 24:1 in engines for cars and com-
mercial vehicles, depending on the engine 
design and the fuel-injection method. 
It is therefore higher than in gasoline engines
(ε = 7 : 1...13 : 1). Due to the susceptibility of
gasoline to knocking, higher compression 
ratios and the resulting higher combustion-
chamber temperatures would cause the
air/fuel mixture to spontaneously combust 
in an uncontrolled manner.

The air inside a diesel engine is compressed

to a pressure of 30...50 bar (conventionally
aspirated engine) or 70...150 bar (turbo -
charged/super charged engine). This generates
temperatures ranging from 700 to 900°C 
(Fig. 3). The ignition temperature of the most
easily combustible components of diesel fuel
is around 250°C.

Torque and power output

19

Torque and power output

Torque
The conrod converts the linear motion 
of the piston into rotational motion of 
the crankshaft. The force with which the
 expanding air/fuel mixture forces the piston
downwards is thus translated into rotational
force or torque by the leverage of the crank-
shaft. 

The output torque M of the engine is,
therefore, dependent on mean pressure pe
(mean piston or operating pressure). 
It is expressed by the equation:

M = pe · VH / (4 · π)

where
VH is the cubic capacity of the engine and 
π ≈ 3.14.

The mean pressure can reach levels of
8...22 bar in small turbocharged diesel
 engines for cars. By comparison, gasoline 
engines achieve levels of 7...11 bar.

The maximum achievable torque, Mmax, that
the engine can deliver is determined by its 
design (cubic capacity, method of aspiration,
etc.). The torque output is adjusted to the re-
quirements of the driving situation  essentially
by altering the fuel and air mass and the mix-
ing ratio.

Torque increases in relation to engine
speed, n, until maximum torque, Mmax, 
is reached (Fig. 1). As the engine speed in-
creases beyond that point, the torque begins
to fall again (maximum permissible engine
load, desired performance, gearbox design). 

Engine design efforts are aimed at generating
maximum torque at low engine speeds (un-
der 2,000 rpm) because at those speeds fuel
consumption is at its most economical and
the engine’s response characteristics are per-
ceived as positive (good “pulling power”). 

Power output
The power P (work per unit of time) gener-
ated by the engine depends on torque M and
engine speed n. Engine power output in-
creases with engine speed until it reaches its
maximum level, or rated power Prated at the
engine’s rated speed, nrated. The following
equation applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

Figure 1a shows a comparison between the
power curves of diesel engines made in 1968
and in 1998 in relation to engine speed. 

Due to their lower maximum engine speeds,
diesel engines have a lower displacement-
 related power output than gasoline engines.
Modern diesel engines for cars have rated
speeds of between 3,500 and 5,000 rpm.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Engine efficiency

Engine efficiency

The internal-combustion engine does work
by changing the pressure and volume of a
working gas (cylinder charge). 

Effective efficiency of the engine is the ratio
between input energy (fuel) and useful work.
This results from the thermal efficiency of an
ideal work process (Seiliger process) and the
percentage losses of a real process.

Seiliger process
Reference can be made to the Seiliger process
as a thermodynamic comparison process for
the reciprocating-piston engine. It describes
the theoretically useful work  under ideal 
conditions. This ideal process assumes the
following simplifications: 
(cid:2) Ideal gas as working medium
(cid:2) Gas with constant specific heat
(cid:2) No flow losses during gas exchange

The state of the working gas can be described
by specifying pressure (p) and volume (V).
Changes in state are presented in the p-V
chart (Fig. 1), where the enclosed area corre-
sponds to work that is carried out in an oper-
ating cycle. 

In the Seiliger process, the following process
steps take place:

Isentropic compression (1-2)
With isentropic compression (compression 
at constant entropy, i.e. without transfer of
heat), pressure in the cylinder increases while
the volume of the gas decreases.

Isochoric heat propagation (2-3)
The air/fuel mixture starts to burn. Heat
propagation (qBV) takes place at a constant
volume (isochoric). Gas pressure also in-
creases.

Isobaric heat propagation (3-3(cid:0))
Further heat propagation (qBp) takes place 
at constant pressure (isobaric) as the piston
moves downwards and gas volume increases.

Isentropic expansion (3(cid:0)-4)
The piston continues to move downwards to
bottom dead center. No further heat transfer
takes place. Pressure drops as volume in-
creases. 

Isochoric heat dissipation (4-1)
During the gas-exchange phase, the remain-
ing heat is removed (qA). This takes place at 
a constant gas volume (completely and at
 infinite speed). The initial situation is thus 
restored and a new operating cycle begins.

p-V chart of the real process
To determine the work done in the real
process, the pressure curve in the cylinder 
is measured and presented in the p-V chart
(Fig. 2). The area of the upper curve corre-
sponds to the work present at the piston.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Engine efficiency

For assisted-aspiration engines, the gas-ex-
change area (WG) has to be added to this
since the compressed air delivered by the
turbocharger/supercharger also helps to
press the piston downwards on the induc-
tion stroke. 

Losses caused by gas exchange are over-
compensated at many operating points by
the supercharger/turbocharger, resulting in 
a positive contribution to the work done. 

ηg: efficiency of cycle factor 
ηg specifies work done in the real high-pres-
sure work process as a factor of the theoreti-
cal work of the Seiliger process.

Deviations between the real and the ideal

processes mainly result from use of a real
working gas, the finite velocity of heat prop-
agation and dissipation, the position of heat
propagation, wall heat loss, and flow losses
during the gas-exchange process. 

Representation of pressure by means of the
crankshaft angle (Fig. 3, previous page) is
used in the thermodynamic pressure-curve
analysis, for example. 

Efficiency
Effective efficiency of the diesel engine is
 defined as:

ηe =

We
WB

We is the work effectively available at the
crankshaft.
WB is the calorific value of the fuel supplied.

Effective efficiency ηe is representable as the
product of the thermal efficiency of the ideal
process and other efficiencies that include
the influences of the real process: 

ηe = ηth · ηg · ηb · ηm = ηi · ηm

ηth: thermal efficiency 
ηth is the thermal efficiency of the Seiliger
process. This process considers heat losses
occurring in the ideal process and is mainly
dependent on compression ratio and excess-
air factor. 

As the diesel engine runs at a higher com-

pression ratio than a gasoline engine and 
a high excess-air factor, it achieves higher
 efficiency. 

ηb: fuel conversion factor 
ηb considers losses occurring due to incom-
plete fuel combustion in the cylinder. 

ηm: mechanical efficiency 
ηm includes friction losses and losses arising
from driving ancillary assemblies. Frictional
and power-transmission losses increase with
engine speed. At nominal speed, frictional
losses are composed of the following: 
(cid:2) Pistons and piston rings approx. 50%
(cid:2) Bearings approx. 20%
(cid:2) Oil pump approx. 10%
(cid:2) Coolant pump approx. 5%
(cid:2) Valve-gear approx. 10%
(cid:2) Fuel-injection pump approx. 5%

If the engine has a supercharger, this must
also be included.

ηi: efficiency index 
The efficiency index is the ratio between
 “indexed” work present at the piston Wi
and the calorific value of the fuel supplied.

Work effectively available at the crankshaft
We results from indexed work taking me-
chanical losses into consideration:
We = Wi · ηm.

Operating statuses

Starting
Starting an engine involves the following
stages: cranking, ignition and running up 
to self-sustained operation. 

The hot, compressed air produced by the
compression stroke has to ignite the injected
fuel (combustion start). The minimum igni-
tion temperature required for diesel fuel is
approx. 250°C.

This temperature must also be reached 
in poor conditions. Low engine speeds, low
outside temperatures, and a cold engine lead
to relatively low final compression tempera-
tures due to the fact that: 
(cid:2) The lower the engine speed, the lower 
the ultimate pressure at the end of the
compression stroke and, accordingly, the
ultimate temperature (Fig. 1). The reasons
for this phenomenon are leakage losses
through the piston ring gaps between the
piston and the cylinder wall and the fact
that when the engine is first started, there is
no thermal expansion and an oil film has
not formed. Due to heat loss during com-

pression, maximum compression tempera-
ture is reached a few degrees before TDC
(thermodynamic loss angle, Fig. 2).

(cid:2) When the engine is cold, heat loss occurs
across the combustion-chamber surface
area during the compression stroke. On 
indirect-injection (IDI) engines, this heat
loss is particularly high due to the larger
surface area. 

(cid:2) Internal engine friction is higher at low
temperatures than at normal operating
temperature because of the higher viscosity
of the engine oil. For this reason, and also
due to low battery voltage, the starter-mo-
tor speed is only relatively low.

(cid:2) The speed of the starter motor is particu-

larly low when it is cold because the battery
voltage drops at low temperatures. 

The following measures are taken to raise
temperature in the cylinder during the start-
ing phase:

Fuel heating
A filter heater or direct fuel heater (Fig. 3 on
next page) can prevent the precipitation of
paraffin crystals that generally occurs at low

temperatures (during the starting phase and
at low outside temperatures). 

Start-assist systems
The air/fuel mixture in the combustion
chamber (or in the prechamber or whirl
chamber) is normally heated by sheathed-
 element glow plugs in the starting phase on
direct-injection (DI) engines for passenger
cars, or indirect-injection engines (IDI). On
direct-injection (DI) engines for commercial
vehicles, the intake air is preheated. Both the
above methods assist fuel vaporization and
air/fuel mixing and therefore facilitate reliable
combustion of the air/fuel mixture.

Glow plugs of the latest generation require 
a preheating time of only a few seconds
(Fig. 4), thus allowing a rapid start. The lower
post-glow temperature also permits longer
post-glow times. This reduces not only harm-
ful pollutant emissions but also noise levels
during the engine’s warm-up period.

Injection adaptation
Another means of assisted starting is to inject
an excess amount of fuel for starting to com-
pensate for condensation and leakage losses
in the cold engine, and to increase  engine
torque in the running-up phase. 

Advancing the start of injection during the
warming-up phase helps to offset longer 
ignition lag at low temperatures and to ensure
reliable ignition at top dead center, i.e. at
maximum final compression temperature. 
The optimum start of injection must be
achieved within tight tolerance limits. As the
internal cylinder pressure (compression pres-
sure) is still too low, fuel injected too early
has a greater penetration depth and precipi-
tates on the cold cylinder walls. There, only a
small proportion of it vaporizes since then
the temperature of the air charge is too low.

If the fuel is injected too late, ignition occurs
during the downward stroke (expansion
phase), and the piston is not fully accelerated,
or combustion misses occur.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Operating statuses

25

No load
No load refers to all engine operating statuses
in which the engine is overcoming only its
own internal friction. It is not producing any
torque output. The accelerator pedal may be
in any position. All speed ranges up to and
including breakaway speed are possible.

Idle
The engine is said to be idling when it is run-
ning at the lowest no-load speed. The acceler-
ator pedal is not depressed. The engine does
not produce any torque. It only overcomes its
internal friction. Some sources  refer to the
entire no-load range as idling. The upper no-
load speed (breakaway speed) is then called
the upper idle speed.

Full load
At full load (or Wide-Open Throttle (WOT)),
the accelerator pedal is fully depressed, or the
full-load delivery limit is controlled by the
engine management dependent on the oper-
ating point. The maximum possible fuel vol-
ume is injected and the engine generates its
maximum possible torque output under
steady-state conditions. Under non steady-
state conditions (limited by turbocharger/
supercharger pressure) the engine develops
the maximum possible (lower) full-load
torque with the quantity of air available. All
engine speeds from idle speed to nominal
speed are possible.

Part load
Part load covers the range between no load
and full load. The engine is generating an
output between zero and the maximum
 possible torque.

Lower part-load range
This is the operating range in which the diesel
engine’s fuel consumption is particularly 
economical in comparison with the gasoline
engine. “Diesel knock” that was a problem 
on earlier diesel engines – particularly when
cold – has virtually been eliminated on diesels
with pre-injection.

As explained in the “Starting” section, the
 final compression temperature is lower at
lower engine speeds and at lower loads. In
comparison with full load, the combustion
chamber is relatively cold (even when the 
engine is running at operating temperature)
because the energy input and, therefore, the
temperatures, are lower. After a cold start, the
combustion chamber heats up very slowly in
the lower part-load range. This  is particularly
true for engines with prechamber or whirl
chambers because the larger surface area
means that heat loss is particularly high.

At low loads and with pre-injection, only a
few mm3 of fuel are delivered in each injec-
tion cycle. In this situation, particularly high
demands are placed on the accuracy of the
start of injection and injected fuel quantity.
As during the starting phase, the required
combustion temperature is reached also at
idle speed only within a small range of piston
travel near TDC. Start of injection is con-
trolled very precisely to coincide with that
point.

During the ignition-lag period, only a small
amount of fuel may be injected since, at the
point of ignition, the quantity of fuel in the
combustion chamber determines the sudden
increase in pressure in the cylinder.

Transition between operating statuses
If the load, the engine speed, or the accelera-
tor-pedal position change, the engine’s oper-
ating state changes (e.g. its speed or torque
output).

The response characteristics of an engine can
be defined by means of characteristic data di-
agrams or maps. The map in Figure 5 shows
an example of how the engine speed changes
when the accelerator-pedal position changes
from 40% to 70% depressed. Starting from
operating point A, the new part-load operat-
ing point D is reached via the full-load curve
(B-C). There, power demand and engine
power output are equal. The engine speed 
increases from nA to nD.

The greater the increase in pressure, the
louder the combustion noise. Pre-injection 
of approx. 1 mm3 (for cars) of fuel virtually
cancels out ignition lag at the main injection
point, and thus substantially reduces combus-
tion noise. 

Overrun
The engine is said to be overrunning when it
is driven by an external force acting through
the drivetrain (e.g. when descending an
 incline). No fuel is injected (overrun fuel cut-
off). 

Steady-state operation
Torque delivered by the engine corresponds
to the torque required by the accelerator-
pedal position. Engine speed remains con-
stant.

Non-steady-state operation
The engine’s torque output does not equal 
the required torque. The engine speed is not
constant.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Operating conditions

27

Operating conditions

In a diesel engine, the fuel is injected directly
into the highly compressed hot air which
causes it to ignite spontaneously. Therefore,
and because of the heterogeneous air/fuel
mixture, the diesel engine – in contrast with
the gasoline engine – is not restricted by ig-
nition limits (i.e. specific air-fuel ratios λ).
For this reason, at a constant air volume in
the cylinder, only the fuel quantity is con-
trolled.

The fuel-injection system must assume the
functions of metering the fuel and distribut-
ing it evenly over the entire charge. It must
accomplish this at all engine speeds and
loads, dependent on the pressure and tem-
perature of the intake air.

Thus, for any combination of engine operat-
ing parameters, the fuel-injection system
must deliver: 
(cid:2) The correct amount of fuel
(cid:2) At the correct time
(cid:2) At the correct pressure
(cid:2) With the correct timing pattern and at the
correct point in the combustion chamber

In addition to optimum air/fuel mixture
considerations, metering the fuel quantity
also requires taking account of operating
limits such as:
(cid:2) Emission restrictions (e.g. smoke emis-

sion limits)

(cid:2) Combustion-peak pressure limits
(cid:2) Exhaust temperature limits
(cid:2) Engine speed and full-load limits 
(cid:2) Vehicle or engine-specific load limits, and
(cid:2) Altitude and turbocharger/supercharger

pressure limits

Smoke limit
There are statutory limits for particulate
emissions and exhaust-gas turbidity. As a
large part of the air/fuel mixing process only
takes place during combustion, localized
over-enrichment occurs, and, in some cases,
this leads to an increase in soot-particle
emissions, even at moderate levels of excess
air. The air-fuel ratio usable at the statutory
full-load smoke limit is a measure of the
 efficiency of air utilization. 

Combustion pressure limits
During the ignition process, the partially
 vaporized fuel mixed with air burns at high
compression, at a rapid rate, and at a high

initial thermal-release peak. This is referred 
to as “hard” combustion. High final compres-
sion peak pressures occur during this phe-
nomenon, and the resulting forces exert
stresses on engine components and are sub-
ject to periodic changes. The dimensioning
and durability of the engine and drivetrain
components, therefore, limit the permissible
combustion pressure and, consequently, the
injected fuel quantity. The sudden rise in
combustion pressure is mostly counteracted
by pre-injection.

Exhaust-gas temperature limits
The high thermal stresses placed on the
 engine components surrounding the hot
combustion chamber, the heat resistance of
the exhaust valves and of the exhaust system
and cylinder head determine the maximum
exhaust temperature of a diesel engine.

Engine speed limits
Due to the existing excess air in the diesel en-
gine, power at constant engine speed mainly
depends on injected fuel quantity. If the
amount of fuel supplied to a diesel  engine is
increased without a corresponding increase 
in the load that it is working against, then the
engine speed will rise. If the fuel supply is not
reduced before the engine reaches a critical

speed, the engine may exceed its maximum
permitted engine speed, i.e. it could self-de-
struct. Consequently, an engine speed limiter
or governor is  absolutely essential on a diesel
engine. 

On diesel engines used to drive road-going
vehicles, the engine speed must be infinitely
variable by the driver using the accelerator
pedal. In addition, when the engine is under
load or when the accelerator pedal is released,
the engine speed must not be allowed to drop
below the idling speed to a standstill. This is
why a minimum-maximum-speed governor
is fitted. The speed range between these two
points is controlled using the accelerator-
pedal position. If the diesel engine is used to
drive a machine, it is expected to keep to a
specific speed constant, or remain within per-
mitted limits, irrespective of load. A variable-
speed governor is then fitted to control speed
across the entire range.

A program map is definable for the engine
operating range. This map (Fig. 1, previous
page) shows the fuel quantity in relation to
engine speed and load, and the necessary ad-
justments for temperature and air-pressure
variations.

Altitude and turbocharger/supercharger
pressure limits
The injected fuel quantity is usually designed
for sea level. If the engine is operated at high
elevations (height above mean sea level), the
fuel quantity must be adjusted in relation to
the drop in air pressure in order to comply
with smoke limits. A standard value is the
barometric elevation formula, i.e. air density
decreases by approximately 7% per 1,000 m of
elevation.

With turbocharged engines, the cylinder
charge in dynamic operation is often lower
than in static operation. Since the maximum
injected fuel quantity is designed for static
operation, it must be reduced in dynamic 
operation in line with the lower air-flow rate
(full-load limited by charge-air pressure).

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Fuel-injection system

29

Fuel-injection system

The low-pressure fuel supply conveys fuel
from the fuel tank and delivers it to the fuel-
injection system at a specific supply pressure.
The fuel-injection pump generates the fuel
pressure required for injection. In most 
systems, fuel runs through high-pressure
 delivery lines to the injection nozzle and is 
injected into the combustion chamber at 
a pressure of 200...2,200 bar on the nozzle
side.

Engine power output, combustion noise, 
and exhaust-gas composition are mainly
 influenced by the injected fuel mass, the
 injection point, the rate of discharge, and 
the combustion process.

Up to the 1980s, fuel injection, i.e. the in-
jected fuel quantity and the start of injection
on vehicle engines, was mostly controlled me-
chanically. The injected fuel quantity is then
varied by a piston timing edge or via slide
valves, depending on load and engine speed.
Start of injection is adjusted by mechanical
control using flyweight governors, or hy-
draulically by pressure control (see  section
entitled “Overview of diesel fuel- injection
systems”).

Now electronic control has fully replaced me-
chanical control – not only in the automotive
sector. Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) man-
ages the fuel-injection process by involving
various parameters, such as engine speed,
load, temperature, geographic  elevation, etc.
in the calculation. Start of injection and fuel
injection quantity are controlled by solenoid
valves, a process that is much more precise
than mechanical control.

(cid:1)

Size of injection

An engine developing 75 kW (102 HP) and 
a specific fuel consumption of 200 g/kWh 
(full load) consumes 15 kg fuel per hour. On a
4-stroke 4-cylinder engine, the fuel is distrib-
uted by 288,000 injections at 2,400 revs per
minute. This results in a fuel volume of approx.
60 mm3 per injection. By comparison, a rain-
drop has a volume of approximately 30 mm3.

Even greater precision in metering requires an
idle with approx. 5 mm3 fuel per injection and a
pre-injection of only 1 mm3. Even the minutest
variations have a negative effect on the

smooth running of the engine, noise, and pol-
lutant emissions. 

The fuel-injection system not only has to deliver
precisely the right amount of fuel for each indi-
vidual, it also has to distribute the fuel evenly to
the individual cylinder of an engine. Electronic
Diesel Control (EDC) adapts the injected fuel
quantity for each cylinder in order to achieve 
a particularly smooth-running engine.

30

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Combustion chambers

Combustion chambers

The shape of the combustion chamber is one
of the decisive factors in determining the
quality of combustion and therefore the per-
formance and exhaust characteristics of 
a diesel engine. Appropriate design of com-
bustion-chamber geometry combined with
the action of the piston can produce whirl,
squish, and turbulence effects that are used 
to improve distribution of the liquid fuel or
air/fuel vapor spray inside of the combustion
chamber.

The following technologies are used: 
(cid:2) Undivided combustion chamber (Direct

Injection (DI) engines) and

(cid:2) Divided combustion chamber (Indirect 

Injection (IDI) engines)

The proportion of direct-injection engines 
is increasing due to their more economical
fuel consumption (up to 20% savings). 
The harsher combustion noise (particularly
under acceleration) can be reduced to the
level of indirect-injection engines by pre-in-
jection. Engines with divided combustion
chambers now hardly figure at all among 
new developments.

1

Direct injection

Undivided combustion chamber 
(direct-injection engines)
Direct-injection engines (Fig. 1) have a higher
level of efficiency and operate more economi-
cally than indirect-injection engines. Accord-
ingly, they are used in all types of commercial
vehicles and most modern diesel cars.

As the name suggests, the direct-injection
process involves injecting the fuel directly
into the combustion chamber, part of which
is formed by the shape of the piston crown
(piston crown recess, 2). Fuel atomization,
heating, vaporization and mixing with the air
must therefore take place in rapid succession.
This places exacting demands on fuel and air
delivery. During the induction and compres-
sion strokes, the special shape of the intake
port in the cylinder head creates an air vortex
inside of the cylinder. The shape of the com-
bustion chamber also contributes to the air
flow pattern at the end of the compression
stroke (i.e. at the moment of fuel injection).
Of the combustion chamber  designs used
over the history of the diesel engine, the most
widely used at present is the ω piston crown
recess.

In addition to creating effective air turbu-
lence, the technology must also ensure that
fuel is delivered in such a way that it is evenly
distributed throughout the combustion
chamber to achieve rapid mixing. A multi-
hole nozzle is used in the direct-injection
process and its nozzle-jet position is opti-
mized as a factor of combustion-chamber 
design. Direct fuel injection requires very
high injection pressures (up to 2,200 bar).
In practice, there are two types of direct

fuel injection:
(cid:2) Systems in which mixture formation is
 assisted by specifically created air-flow
 effects and

(cid:2) Systems which control mixture formation
virtually exclusively by means of fuel injec-
tion and largely dispense with any air-flow
effects

In the latter case, no effort is expended in cre-
ating air-turbulence effects and this is  evident
in smaller gas replacement losses and more
effective cylinder charging. At the same time,
however, far more demanding requirements
are placed on the fuel-injection system with
regard to injection-nozzle positioning, the
number of nozzle jets, the degree of atomiza-
tion (dependent on spray-hole diameter), and
the intensity of injection pressure in order to
obtain the required short injection times and
quality of the air/fuel mixture.

Divided combustion chamber 
(indirect injection)
For a long time diesel engines with divided
combustion chambers (indirect-injection en-
gines) held an advantage over direct- injection
engines in terms of noise and  exhaust-gas
emissions. That was the reason why they were
used in cars and light commercial vehicles.
Now direct-injection engines are more eco-
nomical than IDI engines, with comparable
noise emissions as a result of their high injec-
tion pressures, electronic diesel control, and
pre-injection. As a result, indirect-injection
engines are no longer used in new vehicles.

There are two types of processes with  divided
combustion chamber:
(cid:2) The precombustion chamber system and 
(cid:2) The whirl-chamber system

Precombustion chamber system
In the prechamber (or precombustion 
chamber) system, fuel is injected into a hot
prechamber recessed into the cylinder head
(Fig. 2, 2). The fuel is injected through a pin-
tle nozzle (1) at a relatively low pressure (up
to 450 bar). A specially shaped baffle (3) in
the center of the chamber diffuses the jet of
fuel that strikes it and mixes it thoroughly
with the air. 

Combustion starting in the prechamber
 drives the partly combusted air/fuel mixture
through the connecting channel (4) into 
the main combustion chamber. Here and fur-
ther down the combustion process, the in-
jected fuel is mixed intensively with the exist-
ing air. The ratio of precombustion chamber
volume to main combustion chamber volume
is approx. 1 : 2.

Precombustion chamber system 

The short ignition lag 1) and the gradual re-
lease of energy produce a soft combustion ef-
fect with low levels of noise and engine load. 

1)

Time from start of
 injection to start of
ignition

A differently shaped prechamber with an
evaporation recess and a different shape and
position of the baffle (spherical pin) apply a
specific degree of whirl to the air that passes
from the cylinder into the prechamber during
the compression stroke. The fuel is injected 
at an angle of 5 degrees in relation to the
prechamber axis.

So as not to disrupt the progression of com-
bustion, the glow plug (5) is positioned on
the “lee side” of the air flow. A controlled
post-glow period of up to 1 minute after a
cold start (dependent on coolant tempera-
ture) helps to improve exhaust-gas character-
istics and reduce engine noise during the
warm-up period.

Basic principles of the diesel engine

Combustion chambers

Swirl-chamber system
With this process, combustion is also initiated
in a separate chamber (swirl chamber) that
has approx. 60% of the compression volume.
The spherical and disk-shaped swirl chamber
is linked by a connecting channel that dis-
charges at a tangent into the cylinder cham-
ber (Fig. 3, 2).

During the compression cycle, air entering
via the connecting channel is set into a
swirling motion. The fuel is injected so that
the swirl penetrates perpendicular to its axis
and meets a hot section of the chamber wall
on the opposite side of the chamber.

As soon as combustion starts, the air/fuel
mixture is forced under pressure through the
connecting channel into the cylinder cham-
ber where it is turbulently mixed with the re-
maining air. With the swirl-chamber system,
the losses due to gas flow between the main
combustion chamber and the swirl chamber
are less than with the precombustion cham-
ber system because the connecting channel
has a larger cross-section. This results in
smaller throttle-effect losses and consequent
benefits for internal efficiency and fuel con-
sumption. However, combustion noise is
louder than with the precombustion chamber
system.

It is important that mixture formation takes
place as completely as possible inside the
swirl chamber. The shape of the swirl cham-
ber, the alignment and shape of the fuel jet
and the position of the glow plug must be
carefully matched to the engine in order to
obtain optimum mixture formation at all 
engine speeds and under all operating condi-
tions.

Another demand is for rapid heating of the
swirl chamber after a cold start. This reduces
ignition lag and combustion noise as well as
preventing unburned hydrocarbons (blue
smoke) during the warm-up period.

M System

In the direct-injection system with recess-wall
deposition (M system) for commercial-vehicle
and fixed-installation diesel engines and multi-
fuel engines, a single-jet nozzle sprays the fuel
at a low injection pressure against the wall of
the piston crown recess. There, it vaporizes
and is absorbed by the air. This system thus
uses the heat of the piston recess wall to
 vaporize the fuel. If the air flow inside of the
combustion chamber is properly adapted, an
extremely homogeneous air/fuel mixture with a

long combustion period, low pressure increase
and, therefore, quiet combustion can be
achieved. Due to its consumption disadvan-
tages compared with the air-distributing 
direct injection
process, the 
M system is 
no longer used 
in modern appli-
cations.

Fuel consumption in everyday practice

Automotive manufacturers are obliged
by law to specify the fuel consumption
of their vehicles. This figure is deter-
mined from the exhaust-gas emissions
during the exhaust-gas test when the
vehicle travels a specific route profile
(test cycle). The fuel consumption fig-
ures are therefore comparable for all
 vehicles. 

Every driver makes a significant con-

tribution to reducing fuel consumption
by his or her driving style. Reducing the
fuel consumption that the driver can
achieve with a vehicle depends on
 several factors. 

Applying the measures listed below, 
an “economical” driver can reduce fuel
consumption in everyday traffic by 20 
to 30% compared to an average driver.
The reduction in fuel consumption
achievable by applying the individual
measures depends on a number of
 factors, mainly the route profile (city
streets, overland roads), and on traffic
conditions. For this reason, it is not
 always practical to specify figures for
fuel-consumption savings. 

Positive influences on fuel consumption
(cid:1) Tire pressure: Remember to increase tire pressure when the vehicle is carrying a full payload

(cid:1) When accelerating at high load and low engine speed, shift up at 2,000 rpm.
(cid:1) Drive in the highest possible gear. You can even drive at full-load at engine speeds below

(saving: approx. 5%).

2,000 rpm. 

(cid:1) Avoid braking and re-accelerating by adopting a forward-looking style of driving.
(cid:1) Use overrun fuel cutoff to the full.
(cid:1) Switch off the engine when the vehicle is stopped for an extended period of time, e.g. at traffic
lights with a long red phase, or at closed railroad crossings (3 minutes at idle consumes as
much fuel as driving 1 km).

(cid:1) Use high-lubricity engine oils (saving: approx. 2% according to manufacturer specifications).

Fuels

Diesel fuel

Fuels

Diesel fuels are the product of graduated dis-
tillation of crude oil. They contain a whole
range of individual hydrocarbons with boil-
ing points ranging from roughly 180°C to
370°C. Diesel fuel ignites on average at 
approximately 350°C (lower limit 220°C),
which is very early in comparison with 
gasoline (on average 500°C). 

Diesel fuel

In order to cover the growing demand 
for diesel fuels, refineries are increasingly
adding conversion products, i.e. thermal and
catalytic-cracking products. They are ob-
tained by cracking large heavy-oil molecules.

Quality and grading criteria
In Europe, the standard for diesel fuels is
EN 590. The key parameters are listed in 
Table 1. Defining limits is intended to secure

troublefree vehicle operation and restrict 
pollutants. 

In many other countries around the 
world, fuel standards are less strict. The 
U.S. standard for diesel fuels, ASTM D975, 
for example, specifies fewer criteria and 
applies less stringent limits to these quality
 criteria. The requirements for marine and
fixed-installation engines are also much 
less demanding. 

High-quality diesel fuels are characterized 
by the following features:
(cid:2) High cetane number
(cid:2) Relatively low final boiling point
(cid:2) Narrow density and viscosity spread
(cid:2) Low aromatic compounds (particularly
polyaromatic compounds) content 

(cid:2) Low sulfur content

In addition, the following characteristics are
particularly important for the service life and
constant function of fuel-injection  systems:
(cid:2) Good lubricity
(cid:2) Absence of free water
(cid:2) Limited pollution with particulate

The most important criteria are explained in
detail below.

Cetane number, cetane index
The Cetane Number (CN) expresses the 
ignition quality of the diesel fuel. The higher 
the cetane number, the greater the fuel’s
 tendency to ignite. As the diesel engine dis-
penses with an externally supplied ignition
spark, the fuel must ignite spontaneously
(auto-ignition) and with minimum delay 
(ignition lag) when injected into the hot,
compressed air in the combustion chamber. 

Cetane number 100 is assigned to n-hexa -
decane (cetane), which ignites very easily,
while slow-igniting methyl naphthalene is 
allocated cetane number 0. The cetane num-
ber of a diesel fuel is defined in a standard
CFR 1) single-cylinder test engine with vari-
able compression pistons. The compression
ratio is measured at constant ignition lag. The
engine is run on reference fuels comprising
cetane and α-methyl naphthalene (Fig. 1) 
at the measured compression ratio. The pro-
portion of cetane in the mixture is altered 
until the same ignition lag is  obtained. 
According to the definition, the cetane 
proportion specifies the cetane  number. 
Example: A mixture comprising 52% cetane
and 48% α-methyl naphthalene has the
cetane number 52. 

A cetane number in excess of 50 is desir-

able for optimized operation in modern
 engines (smooth running, low exhaust-gas
emissions). High-quality diesel fuels contain 
a high proportion of paraffins with high CN
ratings. Conversely, aromatic compounds
 reduce ignition quality. 

Yet another parameter of ignition quality is
provided by the cetane index, which is calcu-
lated on the basis of fuel density and various
points on the boiling curve. This purely
mathematical parameter does not take into
account the influence of cetane improvers on
ignition quality. In order to limit the adjust-
ment of the cetane number by means of
cetane improvers, both the cetane number
and the cetane index have been included in
the list of requirements in EN 590. Fuels
whose cetane number has been enhanced by
cetane improvers respond differently during
engine combustion than fuels with the same
natural cetane number.

Boiling range
The boiling range of a fuel, i.e. the tempera-
ture range at which the fuel vaporizes, de-
pends on its composition. 

A low initial boiling point makes a fuel
suitable for use in cold weather, but also
means a lower cetane number and poor
 lubricant properties. This raises the wear 
risk for central injection units.

Diesel fuel

On the other hand, if the final boiling point is
situated at high temperatures, this can result
in increased soot production and nozzle cok-
ing (deposit caused by chemical decomposi-
tion of not easily volatized fuel constituents
on the nozzle cone, and deposits of combus-
tion residues). For this reason, the final boil-
ing point should not be too high. The re-
quirement of the Association des Construc-
teurs Européens d’Automobiles (ACEA: 
Association of European Automobile Manu-
facturers) is 350°C.

Filtration limit (cold-flow properties)
Precipitation of paraffin crystals at low tem-
peratures can result in fuel-filter blockage, 
ultimately leading to interruption of fuel
flow. In worst-case scenarios, paraffin parti-
cles can start to form at temperatures of 0°C
or even higher. The cold-flow properties of 
a fuel are assessed by means of the “filtration
limit” (Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP)). 
European Standard EN 590 defines the
CFPP for various classes, and can be defined
by individual member states depending on
the prevailing geographical and climatic con-
ditions. 

Formerly, owners sometimes added regular
gasoline to their vehicle fuel tanks to  improve
the cold response of diesel fuel. This practice
is no longer necessary now that fuels conform
to standards, and, in any case, this would 
invalidate any warranty claims if damage 
occurs.

Flash point
The flash point is the temperature at which
the quantities of vapor which a combustible
fluid emits to the atmosphere are sufficient to
allow a spark to ignite the air/vapor mixture
above the fluid. For safety reasons, (e.g. for
transportation and storage), diesel fuel 
is placed in Hazard Class A III, i.e. its flash
point is over 55°C. Less than 3% gasoline 
in the diesel fuel is sufficient to lower the
flash point to such an extent that ignition 
becomes possible at room temperature.

Density
The energy content of diesel fuel per unit 
of volume increases with density. Assuming
constant fuel-injection-pump settings (i.e.
constant injected fuel quantity), the use of 
fuels with widely different densities causes
variations in mixture ratios due to fluctua-
tions in calorific value. 

When an engine runs on fuel that has a
high type-dependent density, engine perfor-
mance and soot emissions increase; as fuel
density decreases, these parameters drop. 
As a result, the requirements call for a diesel
fuel that has a low type-dependent density
spread. 

Viscosity
Viscosity is a measure of a fuel’s resistance to
flow due to internal friction. Leakage losses in
the fuel-injection pump result if diesel-fuel
viscosity is too low, and this in turn  results in
performance loss. 

Much higher viscosity – e.g. Fatty Acid
Methyl Ester (biodiesel) – causes a higher
peak injection pressure at high temperatures
in non-pressure-regulated systems (e.g. unit
injector systems). For this reason, mineral-oil
diesel may not be applied at the maximum
permitted primary pressure. High  viscosity
also changes the spray pattern due to the 
formation of larger droplets.

Lubricity
In order to reduce the sulfur content of 
diesel fuel, it is hydrogenated. In addition 
to removing sulfur, the hydrogenation process
also removes the ionic fuel components that
aid lubrication. After the introduction of
desulfurized diesel fuels, wear- related prob-
lems started to occur on distributor fuel-in-
jection pumps due to the lack of lubricity. 
As a result, they were replaced by diesel fuels
containing lubricity enhancers.

Lubricity is measured in a High-Frequency
Reciprocating Rig (HFRR method). A fixed,
clamped steel ball is ground on a plate by fuel
at high frequency. The magnitude of the re-
sulting flattening, i.e. the Wear Scar Dia meter
(WSD) measured in µm, specifies the amount
of wear, and is thus a measure of fuel lubric-
ity. 

Diesel fuels complying with EN 590 must

have a WSD of (cid:1) 460 µm. 

Sulfur content
Diesel fuels contain chemically bonded sulfur,
and the actual quantities depend on the qual-
ity of the crude petroleum and the compo-
nents added at the refinery. In particular,
crack components mostly have high sulfur
contents. 

To desulfurize fuel, sulfur is removed from
the middle distillate by hydrogenation at high
pressure and temperature in the presence of a
catalyst. The initial byproduct of this process
is hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is subse-
quently converted into pure sulfur. 

Since the beginning of 2000 the EN 590 
maximum limit for the sulfur content of
diesel fuel has been 350 mg/kg. Starting 
2005 all regular gasolines and diesel fuels 
will be subject to a minimum low-sulfur
 requirement (sulfur content < 50 mg/kg)
throughout Europe. Starting 2009 only sul-
fur-free fuels (sulfur content < 10 mg/kg) 
will be allowed. 

In Germany, a penalty tax has been levied

on fuels containing sulfur since 2003. As a 
result, the German market only offers sulfur-
free diesel fuel. This has dropped direct SO2
emissions (sulfur dioxide), as well as emitted
particle mass (sulfur adhering to soot). 

Exhaust-gas treatment systems for NOx and
particulate filters use catalysts. They must run
on sulfur-free fuel since sulfur poisons the 
active catalyst surface. 

Carbon-deposit index
The carbon-deposit index describes a fuel’s
tendency to form carbon residue on injection
nozzles. The processes of carbon depositing
are highly complex. Above all, components
which the diesel fuel contains at the final
boiling point (particularly cracking con-
stituents) influence carbon-deposit  formation
(coking).

38

Fuels

Diesel fuel

Overall contamination
Overall contamination refers to the sum  total
of undissolved foreign particles in the fuel,
such as sand, rust, and undissolved  organic
components, including aging  polymers.
EN 590 permits a maximum of 24 mg/kg.
Very hard silicates as occur in mineral dust
are specially damaging to high-pressure fuel-
injection systems with narrow gap widths.
Even a fraction of the permissible overall 
contamination level of hard particles would
cause erosive and abrasive wear (e.g. at the
seats of solenoid valves). Wear of this nature
results in valve leakage, which lowers fuel-in-
jection pressure and engine performance, and
increases particulate  emissions from the en-
gine. 

Typical European diesel fuels contain about

100,000 particles per 100 ml. Particle sizes of
6 to 7 µm are particularly critical. High-per-
formance fuel filters with high filtration effi-
ciency help to prevent damage caused by par-
ticles.

Water in diesel fuel
Diesel fuel can absorb approx. 100 mg/kg wa-
ter. The solubility limit is defined by the com-
position of the diesel fuel and the ambient
temperature. 

EN 590 permits a maximum water content

of 200 mg/kg. Although much higher water
contents occur in diesel fuel in many coun-
tries, market surveys show that water content
rarely exceeds 200 mg/kg. Samples often do
not detect any water, or detection is incom-
plete, since water is deposited on walls in 
the form of undissolved, “free” water, or 
it settles at the bottom in a separate phase.
Whereas dissolved water does not damage 
the fuel-injection system, even very small
quantities of free water can cause major 
damage to fuel-injection pumps within a
short period of time. 

It is not possible to prevent the entrainment
of water into the fuel tank as a result of con-
densation from the air. For this reason, water
separators are specified as obligatory equip-
ment in certain regions of the world. In addi-
tion, the vehicle manufacturer must design
the tank ventilation system and the fuel-filler
neck so as to prevent additional water from
entering.

(cid:1)

Fuel parameters

Net and gross calorific values
Specific calorific value HU (formerly: lower calorific value) is usually specified to express the
 energy content of fuels. The specific gross calorific value HO (formerly: upper calorific value or
combustion heat) for fuels that have water vapor in their combustion products is higher than the
calorific value since the gross calorific value also includes the heat trapped in the water vapor
 (latent heat). This component is not used in the vehicle. The specific calorific value of diesel fuel
is 42.5 MJ/kg. 

Oxygenates, i.e. fuel constituents containing oxygen, such as alcohol fuels, ether, or fatty-acid
methyl ester, have a lower calorific value than pure hydrocarbons because the oxygen bonded in
them does not contribute to the combustion process. Performance comparable to that achiev-
able with oxygenate-free fuels can only be attained at the cost of higher fuel-consumption rates. 

Calorific value of air/fuel mixture
The calorific value of the combustible air/fuel mixture determines engine output. Assuming a
 constant stoichiometric ratio, this figure remains roughly the same for all liquid fuels and liquefied
gases (approx. 3.5...3.7 MJ/m3).

39

Additives
Additives, a long-standard feature in gaso-
lines, have become commonplace as quality
improvers in diesel fuels. The various agents
are generally combined in additive packages
to achieve a variety of objectives. The total
concentration of additives is normally about
< 0.1%. This does not change the physical 
parameters of fuels, such as density, viscosity,
or the boiling curve.

Lubricity enhancers
It is possible to improve the lubricity of diesel
fuels which have poor lubrication properties
by adding fatty acids, fatty-acid esters, or
glycerins. Biodiesel is also a fatty-acid ester. 
In this case, if diesel fuel already contains a
proportion of biodiesel, no further lubricity
enhancers are added.

Cetane improvers
Cetane improvers are nitric acid esters of 
alcohols added to shorten ignition lag. They
reduce emissions and noise (combustion
noise).

Flow improvers
Flow improvers consist of polymer substances
that lower the filtration limit. They are added
in winter to ensure troublefree operation at
low temperatures. 

Although flow improvers cannot prevent

the precipitation of paraffin crystals from
diesel fuel, it can severely limit their growth.
The size of the crystals produced is so small
that they can still pass through the filter
pores. 

Detergent additives
Detergent additives are used to keep the
 intake system clean. They can also inhibit the
formation of deposits and reduce the buildup
of carbon deposits on the injection nozzles.

Corrosion inhibitors
Corrosion inhibitors are deposited on the
surfaces of metal parts and protect them
against corrosion if water is entrained. 

Antifoaming agents (defoamants)
Adding defoamants helps to avoid excessive
foaming when the vehicle is refueled quickly.

Biodiesel
The term biodiesel covers fatty acid esters 
which are created through cracking of oils 
or greases and then converting with meth-
anol or ethanol. This creates fatty acid 
methyl ester (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl es-
ter (FAEE). The molecules of biodiesel are 
in terms of size and properties much more 
similar to diesel fuel than to vegetable oil. 
Therefore biodiesel cannot under any cir-
cumstances be equated with vegetable oil. 
 
Production
Vegetable oils or animal fats can be used to 
produce biodiesel. The choice of starting 
materials is essentially determined by 
their respective availability. In Europe 
 primarily rape oil is used (Fig. 3), in North 
and South America soybean oil, in the 
ASEAN countries1 palm oil, and on the 
 Indian subcontinent the oil from the 
 purgier nut (jatropha). 

Because esterification can be technically 

carried out much more easily with metha-
nol than it can with ethanol, the methyl 
 esters of these oils are produced by way of 
preference. Used frying oil methyl ester 
(UFOME) is produced worldwide. Because 
methanol is generally produced from coal,

1 Association of Southeast Asian Nations

fatty acid methyl ester cannot strictly 
speaking be seen as fully biogenous. Fatty 
acid ethyl ester on the other hand is made 
up of 100 % biomass when bioethanol is 
used for production. 

The properties of biodiesel are determined 
by various factors. Oils of different vegeta-
ble oil differ in the composition of the fatty-
acid blocks and demonstrate typical fatty-
acid patterns. The type and quantity of un-
saturated fatty acids have, for example, a 
decisive influence on the stability of the 
biodiesel. 

The properties are also affected by the 
pretreatment of the vegetable oil and the 
production process of the biodiesel.

Quality requirements
The quality of biodiesel is regulated in fuel 
standards. Basically the quality require-
ments for biodiesel are described by way 
of the material properties. It is important 
to bear in mind here that limitations with 
regard to the starting materials are 
avoided wherever possible. 

The European standard EN 14214  
(Table 1) is the most comprehensive de-
scription of biodiesel worldwide. Good-
quality biodiesel is defined in this stan-
dard. The quality of biodiesel deviates 
markedly from that of petroleum diesel,

since biodiesel consists of a narrow spec-
trum of fatty acid esters which are polar- 
and chemically reactive. Conventional 
 diesel fuel on the other hand is an inert 
and nonpolar mixture of paraffins and  
aromatic compounds. 

The American biodiesel standard ASTM 
D6751 is less quality-oriented. For exam-
ple, its definition of the minimum require-
ment for oxidation stability is only half as 
high as in EN 14214. This increases the risk 
of problems arising as a result of fuel ag-
ing, particular under limit-value applica-
tion and field conditions. 

Other countries such as Brazil, India and 
Korea have geared themselves to a large 
extent to the European B 100 standard  
EN 14214.

Use in motor vehicles
Pure biodiesel (B 100) is used especially in 
Germany predominantly in commercial ve-
hicles. The high annual mileage ensures 
fast consumption, which enables problems 
with insufficient oxidation stability to be 
avoided. 

From an engine viewpoint it is more favor-
able to use biodiesel in a blend (i.e., as a 
mixture) with petroleum diesel. The diesel 
content increases, for example, stability as 
a rule, but at the same time the sound lu-
bricating effect of biodiesel is maintained. 
For practical purposes it is important to 
specify not only the pure component B 100, 
but also the diesel / biodiesel blends of-
fered on the market. Here the trend is to-
wards small admixtures up to max. 7 % 
biodiesel (B 7 in Europe). 

In closed fleets higher proportions of 
biodiesel are also used (B 30 in France, B 20 
in the USA). In the case of higher contents, 
however, the high boiling point of biodiesel 
can cause it to be heavily introduced into 
the engine oil after its has been injected 
into the combustion chamber via condensa-
tion on the cylinder walls. This affects 
above all vehicles which are fitted with die-
sel particulate filters, and in which regener-
ation occurs by way of a retarded second-
ary injection. Depending on the application 
it is possible particularly in slow part-load 
operation to encounter an unacceptably 
high introduction of biodiesel, which neces-
sitates shorter oil replacement intervals.

Rape oil
Possibilities of use
Rape oil can be used with great success in 
older engines which are equipped, for 
 example, with in-line pumps. With weak 
emission requirements and under the 
premise that an increased number of vehi-
cle breakdowns is accepted, rape oil is an 
inexpensive fuel (provided this is permit-
ted by the boundary tax conditions). 

The 100-tractor program of the German 
Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and 
Consumer Protection (BMELV), which was 
carried out between the years 2000 – 2005, 
has shown that it greatly depends on the 
manufacturer or engine type and retrofit 
whether the use of rape oil is acceptable. 
Of the 107 tractors 63 reached the end of 
the project period without any or with 
minimal failures (repair costs under 
1,000 Euro), while serious and thus cost-
intensive failures occurred in 44 tractors.

Limits of use
Rape oil is, on account of its high density 
and viscosity together with its high volatil-
ity, as a rule not suitable for use in diesel 
engines. The direct use of pure rape oil 
and other vegetable oils in engines is lim-
ited by an insufficient fuel deliverability at 
low temperatures, by the formation of resi-
dues by thermal coking on the injector 
nozzle on account of a lack of vaporability 
due to insufficient spray preparation in the 
combustion chamber, and by the associ-
ated noncompliance with the Euro 4 or 
Euro 5 emission limits. 

Sustainability
A significant increase in the worldwide 
production of vegetable oils is to be reck-
oned with. The demand for vegetable oils 
as the starting product for producing 
biodiesel and for creating bioparaffins will 

increase significantly in the future. A cer-
tificate of sustainability is currently being 
developed for vegetable oils. The introduc-
tion of this certificate is intended to elimi-
nate negative effects on the environment. 
Thus, for example, the cultivation of plan-
tations to obtain palm oil is not permitted 
to result in the clearing of rainforests.

Bioparaffins
Bioparaffins are obtained from fats and 
oils of different origin and quality by 
means of hydrogenation (see Fig. 3). 
 Hydrogenation with hydrogen results in a 
cracking of fats and oils, during which all 
the oxygen atoms and unsaturated bonds 
are also removed. Long-chain alkanes are 
created from the fatty acids, while the 
glycerin content is converted into pro-
pane gas. This chemical process places 
only minimum quality demands on the 
starting materials and results in hydro-
carbons with excellent engine properties. 
Vegetable-oil hydrogenation is thus an al-
ternative to manufacturing biodiesel, dur-
ing which production the vegetable oils 
must be of high quality. Furthermore the 
product properties of bioparaffins are far 
superior to those of biodiesel. Because 
the production of bioparaffins can both 
take place in stand-alone plants and be 
integrated in the existing processes of a 
petroleum refinery, a sharp increase in 
vegetable-oil hydrogenation is antici-
pated. Vegetable-oil hydrogenation is also 
more cost-effective than biodiesel pro-
duction.

At present there are particularly in 
 Germany impediments to vegetable-oil 
 hydrogenation to the effect that counting 
bioparaffins against the bio-quota is lim-
ited. This limitation is intended to support 
the existing structure of the domestic 
biodiesel industry.

Synthetic fuels (synfuels)
Production
Synthetic fuels are built up from individual 
chemical blocks. Coal, natural gas or bio-
mass can be thermally converted into syn-
thesis gas made up of carbon monoxide 
and hydrogen. Linear, straight-chain hy-
drocarbons, the n-paraffins, are then built 
up from these two components on Fischer-
Tropsch catalysts. An additional isomeri-
zation step can be incorporated down-
stream to improve the properties of 
 synthetic diesel fuel, particularly its  
low-temperature resistance. 

This approach to building up fuels anew 

differs fundamentally from the common 
methods, which are based on transforming 
components such as fats or oils by chemi-
cal alteration (esterification, hydrogena-
tion) into fuels. That is why synthetic fuels 
are also known as 2nd-generation fuels. 

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is really non-
specific such that a wealth of different 
components is obtained, starting with 
gases through short-chain gasoline com-
ponents, kerosine and diesel paraffins, 
right down to oils and waxes of high mo-
lecular weight. For reasons of economy 
splitting the production mixture is opti-
mized to a maximum diesel yield. These 
fuels were initially referred to as designer 
fuels, because the notion existed that the 
composition of synthetic diesel fuel could 
be geared exactly to the demands of die-
sel-engine technology. In principle there is 
naturally the possibility of changing the 
fuel composition through the choice of cat-
alysts. But, in view of the wide range of 
products obtained from Fischer-Tropsch 
synthesis, and also for cost reasons the no-
tion of producing fuels of customized com-
position no longer appears justified.

CtL, GtL, BtL
The manufacture of synthetic diesel (syn-
fuel) from coal and natural gas is economi-
cally important. These fuels are known as 
Coal-to-Liquid (CtL) or Gas-to-Liquid (GtL). 
The production of natural gas is only 
worthwhile with large natural-gas deposits 
where the natural gas cannot be attributed 
to any direct use. CtL and GtL are however 
fossil energy sources such that no reduc-
tion in CO2 emissions is achieved. If, on the 
other hand, the fuel is produced from bio-
mass (BtL, Biomass-to-Liquid), there is a 
CO2 advantage, and this fuel is called  
Sunfuel®. 

The conversion process developed by 
the company Choren is however only tried 
and tested on a small scale. Currently a 
plant is being set up with an annual capac-
ity of 15,000 tons. It will depend on the 
lessons learned from this production plant 
as to whether the use of biomass to manu-
facture synthetic fuels also on a large in-
dustrial scale represents a practicable so-
lution. For purposes of comparison: In 
2006 roughly 5 million tons of GtL were 
produced. 

Properties and use in motor vehicles
Fischer-Tropsch products are valuable 
fuel components. They are purely paraf-
finic, i.e., aromatic- and sulfur-free, and 
also have a high cetane number. Fischer-
Tropsch diesel with its low density of ap-
proximately 800 kg/m³ is below the density 
range of the European diesel-fuel standard 
EN 590. Careful validation must be per-
formed before pure Fischer-Tropsch diesel 
can be used in vehicles, particularly in the 
on-the-road vehicle population. 

Due to the lower emissions, particularly 
in the case of nitrogen oxides as well as HC 
and CO, the use of pure synthetic fuels 

Alternative fuels

suggests itself above all in closed fleets in 
centers of population with heavy air pollu-
tion. However, it could be possible with the 
same amount of synthetic diesel fuel to 
achieve identical or sometimes even 
greater emission reductions if this amount 
were to be admixed as a blend component 
in petroleum diesel. Engine tests with dif-
ferent blends of GtL and petroleum diesel 
have shown that at certain operating 
points greater emission savings can be 
achieved by means on non-linear effects 
than corresponds to the purely rated con-
tent of GtL.

 

GtL can be very well marketed as a blend 
component in premium diesel fuels. Fur-
thermore diesel fuels which fail to reach 
the established limit values can be im-
proved by the addition of GtL to such an 
extent that they conform to the standard. 

At present there is still no commercial ba-
sis for the pure use of GtL. The emission 
advantages of using pure GtL can be used 
to reduce the technical expenditure in ex-
haust-gas treatment. This is of particular 
interest when the emissions attain a lower 
stage of the emissions legislation. Changes 
must be made to the engine for this pur-
pose. 

What is important is that the emission 
advantages are evident in the entire driv-
ing cycle and have long-time stability, and 
that vehicle driveability is assured in all 
load states. 

There may perhaps in future be oppor-
tunities for the pure application of GtL in 
more homogeneously configured combus-
tion processes. However, blends of GtL 
with specifically optimized petroleum 
fractions also offer interesting potential 
here.

Dimethyl ether
Dimethyl ether (DME) is a combustible and 
explosive gas with a boiling point of −25 °C 
at 1 bar. DME can be created from synthe-
sis gas or from methanol. With a cetane 
number of roughly 55 DME can be burned 
in the engine with low sooting and with re-
duced nitrogen-oxide formation. But, be-
cause of its low density and the high con-
tent of oxygen, the calorific value is low. 
Using gases such as DME requires an 
adapted fuel-injection system with a com-
plicated low-pressure system and a pres-
sure-proof fuel tank. 

The buildup of an infrastructure for DME 
is less likely, especially since a close fill-
ing-station network already exists for 
 natural gas. 

Alternative fuels for  
gasoline engines

Natural gas 
Properties and production
The main constituent of natural gas is 
methane (CH4) with a content of 83…98 %. 
Further components are inert gases, such 
as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and low-chain 
hydrocarbons.

Natural gas is available worldwide and 
after extraction requires relatively low ex-
penditure for preparation. Depending on 
its origin, however, its composition varies, 
which results in fluctuations when it comes 
to density, calorific value and knock resis-
tance. The properties of natural gas as a 
fuel are to be defined for Germany in the 
standard DIN 51624, which is currently 
 being drawn up.

Methane can also be obtained from 
 biomass, i.e.from liquid manure or refuse

Cylinder-charge control systems

Overview

Cylinder-charge control systems

1)

The cylinder charge
is a mixture of gases
trapped in the cylin-
der when the intake
valves are closed. 
It consists of the 
intake air and the
residual burned
gases from the
 preceding com -
bustion cycle.

In diesel engines, both the fuel mass injected
and the air mass with which it is mixed are
decisive factors in determining torque output
and, therefore, engine performance, and ex-
haust-gas composition. For this reason, the
systems that control the cylinder-air charge 1)
have an important role to play as well as the
fuel-injection system. Cylinder-charge con-
trol systems clean the intake air and affect
the flow, density, and composition (e.g. oxy-
gen content) of the cylinder charge.

Overview

In order to burn the fuel, the engine requires
oxygen which it extracts from the intake air.
In principle, the more oxygen there is avail-
able for combustion in the combustion
chamber, the greater the amount of fuel 
that can be injected for full-load delivery.
There is, therefore, a direct relationship
 between the amount of air with which 
the cylinder is charged and the maximum
possible engine power output.

Cylinder-charge control systems on a diesel engine

Air-intake systems have the function of con-
ditioning the intake air and ensuring that the
cylinders are properly charged. Cylinder-
charge control systems are made up of the
following components (Fig. 1):
(cid:1) Air filter (1)
(cid:1) Turbocharger/supercharger (2)
(cid:1) Exhaust-gas recirculation system (4)
(cid:1) Swirl flaps (5)

Supercharging/turbocharging systems 
(i.e. to precompress air before injection 
in the cylinder) are fitted to most diesel
 engines to raise performance. 

Exhaust-gas recirculation systems are 
 fitted on all modern diesel cars and some
commercial vehicles for the purpose of 
minimizing pollutants in the exhaust gas.
They reduce the amount of oxygen in the
cylinder. Less nitrogen oxides (NOx) caused
by the  resulting drop in combustion tempera-
ture are then formed on combustion.

1) Even the pioneers
of automotive engi-
neering, Gottlieb
Daimler (1885) 
and Rudolf Diesel
(1896), considered
the possibility of
 precompressing
 intake air in order 
to improve perfor-
mance. But it was
the Swiss Alfred
Büchi who first suc-
cessfully produced 
a turbocharger in
1925 – it boosted
power output by
40% (application 
for the patent was
made in 1905). The
first turbocharged
commercial-vehicle
engines were built in
1938. They became
widespread by the
early 1950s.

They became more
widespread from the
1970s onwards.

Turbochargers and 
superchargers

Assisted aspiration by means of turbocharg-
ers or superchargers has been in existence for
many years 1) on large diesel engines for fixed
installations, marine propulsion systems, and
commercial vehicles. It has now been adopted
for fast-running diesel engines in cars 2). In
contrast to a conventionally aspirated engine,
air in a turbocharged or supercharged engine
is forced under pressure into the cylinders.
This increases the air mass in the cylinder
charge and, in combination with a greater
fuel mass, this results in a greater power yield
from the same engine capacity, or the same
power yield from a smaller engine capacity.
Lower fuel consumption is achievable by re-
ducing engine swept volume (downsizing). 
At the same time it improves exhaust-gas

emission rates. 

The diesel engine is particularly suited to as-
sisted aspiration as its compressed cylinder
charge consists only of air rather than a mix-
ture of fuel and air, and it can be economically
combined with a supercharger/turbo charger
because of its quality-based method of con-
trol. On larger commercial-vehicle engines, 
a further increase in mean pressure (and,
therefore, torque) is achieved by higher turbo -
charger pressures and lower compression, but
is offset by poorer cold-starting characteristics. 

A distinction is made between two types of
supercharger/turbocharger:
(cid:1) On the exhaust-gas turbocharger, com-

pression power is won from the exhaust
gas (flow of exhaust gas between engine
and turbocharger).

(cid:1) On the supercharger, compression power
is tapped from the engine crankshaft
 (mechanical coupling between engine 
and supercharger).

Volumetric efficiency
Volumetric efficiency refers to the relationship
between the actual air charge trapped inside
the cylinder and the theoretical air charge

governed by the cylinder capacity under stan-
dard conditions (air pressure p0 = 1,013hPa,
temperature T0 = 273K) without supercharg-
ing/turbocharging. On supercharged/turbo -
charged diesel engines, volumetric efficiency 
is within the range of 0.85...3.0.

Intercooling
In the process of being compressed by the
 turbocharger, air also heats up (to as much as
180°C). Since hot air is less dense than cold air,
a higher air temperature has a negative effect
on cylinder charge. A charge-air cooler (inter-
cooler) downstream of the supercharger/tur-
bocharger (cooled by ambient air or with a
separate coolant circuit) cools the compressed
air, thus increasing the cylinder charge further.
It means that more oxygen is available for
combustion, with the result that a higher max-
imum torque and, therefore, greater power
output is available at a given engine speed. 

The lower temperature of the air entering
the cylinder also reduces the temperatures
generated during the compression stroke.
This has a number of advantages:
(cid:1) Greater thermal efficiency and, therefore,
lower fuel consumption and soot emis-
sion from diesel engines

(cid:1) Reduced knock tendency in gasoline engines 
(cid:1) Lower thermal stresses on the cylinder

block/head

(cid:1) Slight reduction in NOx emissions as a re-
sult of the lower combustion temperature

Turbocharging
Of the methods of assisted aspiration, the
exhaust-gas-driven turbocharger is by far
the most widely used. Turbochargers are
used on engines for cars and commercial
 vehicles as well as on large, heavy-duty
 marine and locomotive engines. 

The exhaust-gas turbocharger is used as 
a means of improving the power-to-weight
ratio, and improving maximum torque at
low to medium engine speeds, when it is
normally fitted with electronic boost-pres-
sure control. In addition, the aspects of min-
imizing pollutants also play a growing role. 

48

Cylinder-charge control systems

Turbochargers and superchargers

Design and operating concept
The hot exhaust gas expelled under pressure
from an internal-combustion engine repre-
sents a substantial loss of energy. It makes
sense, therefore, to utilize some of that energy
to generate pressure in the intake manifold. 

The turbocharger (Fig. 1) is a combination

of two turbo elements:
(cid:1) An exhaust-gas turbine (7) that is driven by

the flow of exhaust gas.

(cid:1) A centrifugal turbo-compressor (2) that is
directly coupled to the turbine by means of
a shaft (11) and which compresses the in-
take air.

The hot exhaust gas flows into the turbine
and, by so doing, forces it to rotate at high
speeds (in diesel engines, up to around
200,000 rpm). The inward-facing blades of
the turbine divert the flow of gas into the 
center from where it passes out to the side 
(8, radial-flow turbine). The connecting shaft
drives the radial compressor. This is the exact
reverse of the turbine: The intake air (3) is
drawn in at the center of the compressor and
is driven outwards by the blades of the im-
peller so that it is compressed (4). 

As a result of exhaust-gas pressure that
builds upstream of the turbine, the engine
has to work harder to expel the exhaust gas
on the exhaust stroke. Besides converting the

1

Commercial-vehicle turbocharger with twin-flow turbine

4

flow energy of exhaust gas into compression
power, the turbine also converts the thermal
energy in the exhaust gas into compression
power. As a result, the increase in charge-air
pressure is greater than the rise in exhaust-gas
pressure upstream of the turbine (positive
scavenging drop). This improves the overall
efficiency of the engine across large sections
of the engine map. 

For fixed-installation engines running at
 constant speed, the turbine and turbocharger
characteristics can be tuned to a high level of 
efficiency and turbocharger pressure. Turbo -
charger design becomes more complicated when
it is applied to road-vehicle engines that do not
run under steady-state conditions – because
they are expected to produce high torque levels,
particularly when accelerating from slow speeds.
Low exhaust-gas temperatures, low exhaust-gas
flow rates, and the mass moment of inertia of
the turbocharger itself all contribute to a slow
buildup of pressure in the compressor at the
start of acceleration. On turbocharged car en-
gines, this is referred to as “turbo lag”. Special
turbochargers have been developed for super-
charging/turbocharging in passenger cars and
commercial vehicles. They respond at small ex-
haust-gas flow rates due to their low intrinsic
mass, and thus improve performance in the
lower rev band to a considerable extent.

Designs
Engines need to be able to generate high
torque even at low speeds. For that reason,
turbochargers are designed for low exhaust-
gas mass flow rates (e.g. full load at an engine
speed of n ≤ 1,800 rpm). To prevent the tur-
bocharger from overloading the engine at
higher exhaust-gas mass flow rates, or being
damaged itself, the turbocharger pressure has
to be controlled. There are three turbo charger
designs which can achieve this:
(cid:2) The wastegate turbocharger
(cid:2) The variable-turbine-geometry turbo -

charger and

(cid:2) The variable-sleeve-turbine turbocharger

Wastegate turbocharger (Fig. 2)
At higher engine speeds or loads, part of the
exhaust flow is diverted past the turbine by 
a bypass valve – the “wastegate” (5). This re-
duces the exhaust-gas flow passing through
the turbine and lowers the exhaust-gas back
pressure, thereby preventing excessive turbo -
charger speed.

At low engine speeds or loads, the waste-
gate closes and the entire exhaust flow passes
through and drives the turbine.

Turbocharger with wastegate

A distinction is made between two methods
of turbocharging.
Constant-pressure turbocharging involves the
use of an exhaust-gas accumulator upstream
of the turbine to smooth out the pressure
pulsations in the exhaust system. As a result,
the turbine can accommodate a higher ex-
haust-gas flow rate at a lower pressure at high
engine speeds. As the exhaust-gas back pres-
sure that the engine is working against 
is lower under those operating conditions,
fuel consumption is also lower. Constant-
pressure turbocharging is used for large-scale
marine, generator and fixed-installation en-
gines.

Pulse turbocharging utilizes the kinetic energy
of the pressure pulsations caused by the ex-
pulsion of the exhaust gas from the cylinders.
Pulse turbocharging achieves higher torques
at lower engine speeds. It is the principle used
by turbochargers for cars and commercial ve-
hicles. Separate exhaust manifolds are used
for different banks of cylinders to prevent in-
dividual cylinders from  interfering with each
other during gas exchange, e.g. two groups of
three cylinders on a six-cylinder engine. If
twin-flow turbines – which have two outer
channels – are used (Fig. 1), the exhaust flows
are kept separate in the turbocharger as well.

In order to obtain good response characteris-
tics, the turbocharger is positioned as close 
as possible to the exhaust valves in the flow 
of hot exhaust gas. It therefore has to be 
made of highly durable materials. On ships –
where hot surfaces in the engine room have 
to be prevented because of the fire risk –
 turbochargers are water-cooled or enclosed in
heat-insulating material. Turbochargers for
gasoline engines, where the exhaust-gas tem-
peratures can be 200...300°C higher than on
diesel engines, may also be water-cooled.

Cylinder-charge control systems

Turbochargers and superchargers

At low engine speeds or loads, they allow 
only a small gap for the exhaust gas to pass
through so that the exhaust-gas back pressure
increases. The exhaust-gas flow velocity
through the turbine is then higher so that 
the turbine turns at a higher speed (a). 
In addition, the exhaust-gas flow is directed
at the outer ends of the turbine blades. This
generates more leverage which in turn pro-
duces greater torque.

At high engine speeds or loads, the deflector
blades open up a larger gap for the exhaust
gas to flow through with the result that the
flow velocity is lower (b). Consequently, the
turbocharger turns more slowly if the flow
volume remains the same, or else its speed
does not increase as much if the flow volume
increases. In that way, the turbocharger pres-
sure is limited.

The wastegate usually takes the form of a flap
integrated in the turbine housing. In the early
days of turbocharger design, a poppet valve
was used in a separate housing parallel to the
turbine.

The wastegate is operated by an electro pneu -
matic charge-pressure actuator (1). That 
actuator is an electrically operated 3/2-way
valve that is connected to a vacuum pump
(2). In its neutral position (de-energized) it
allows atmospheric pressure to act on the
pressure actuator (3). The spring in the
 pressure actuator opens the wastegate.

If a current is applied to the charge-pres-
sure actuator by the engine control unit, it
opens the connection between the pressure
actuator and the vacuum pump so that the
diaphragm is drawn back against the action
of the spring. The wastegate closes and the
turbocharger speed increases.

The turbocharger is designed in such a 
way that the wastegate will always open if the
control system fails. This insures that, at high
engine speeds, excessive turbocharger pres-
sure which might damage the engine or the
turbocharger itself cannot be produced.

On gasoline engines, sufficient vacuum is cre-
ated by the intake manifold. Therefore, unlike
diesel engines, they do not require a vacuum
pump. Both types of engine may also use a
purely electrical wastegate actuator.

Variable-turbine-geometry (VTG)
 turbocharger (Fig. 3)
Varying the rate of gas flow through the tur-
bine by means of Variable Turbine Geometry
(VTG) is another method by which the ex-
haust-gas flow rate can be limited at high en-
gine speeds. The adjustable deflector blades
(3) alter the size of the gap through which the
exhaust gas flows in order to reach the tur-
bine (variation of geometry). By so doing,
they adjust the exhaust-gas pressure acting 
on the turbine in response to the required
turbocharger pressure.

This is the type of turbocharger most widely
used on diesel engines today. It has not been
able to establish itself as the preferred choice
for gasoline engines because of the high 
thermal stresses and the higher exhaust
 temperatures encountered.

Variable-sleeve-turbine (VST) turbocharger
(Fig. 4)
The variable-sleeve-turbine turbocharger is
used on small car engines. On this type of
turbocharger, an intake slide valve (4) alters
the cross-section of the inlet flow to the tur-
bine by opening one or both of the intake
ports (2, 3).

At low engine speeds or loads, only one 
of the intake ports is open (2). The small inlet
aperture produces high exhaust-gas back
pressure combined with a high exhaust-gas
flow velocity, and consequently results in a
high speed of rotation on the part of the 
turbine (1).

When the required turbocharger pressure
is reached, the intake valve gradually opens
the second intake port (3). The flow velocity
of the exhaust gas – and therefore the turbine
speed and the turbocharger pressure – then
gradually reduce.
The engine control unit module controls 
the valve setting by means of a pneumatic 
actuator.

There is also a bypass channel (5) integrated
in the turbine housing so that virtually the
entire exhaust gas flow can be diverted past
the turbine in order to obtain a very low
 turbocharger pressure.

The deflector blade angle is adjusted very
simply by turning an adjuster ring (2). This
sets the deflector blades to the desired angle
by operating them either directly using ad-
justing levers (4) attached to the blades or in-
directly by means of adjuster cams. The ad-
justing ring is operated by a pneumatic actua-
tor (5) to which positive or negative pressure
is applied, or alternatively by an electric mo-
tor with position feedback (position sensor).
The engine control unit controls the actuator.
Thus the turbocharger pressure can be ad-
justed to the optimum setting in response to 
a range of input  variables.

The VTG turbocharger is fully open in its
neutral position and therefore inherently safe,
i.e. if the control system fails, neither the tur-
bocharger nor the engine suffers damage as a
result. There is merely a loss of power at low
engine speeds.

Advantages and disadvantages of
 turbocharging
Downsizing
When compared with a conventionally
 aspirated engine of equal power, the prime
advantage of a turbocharged engine is its
lighter weight and smaller dimensions. It also
has better torque characteristics within the
useful speed range (Fig. 5). Consequently, 
the power output at a given speed is higher 
(A – B) at the same specific fuel consump-
tion.

The same amount of power is available at 
a lower engine speed because of the superior
torque characteristics (B – C). Thus, with 
a turbocharged engine, the point at which 
a required amount of power is produced is
shifted to a position where frictional losses
are lower. The result of this is lower fuel con-
sumption (E – D).

Torque curve
At very low engine speeds, the basic torque 
of a turbocharged engine is similar to that 
of a conventionally aspirated engine. At that
point, the usable energy from the exhaust-gas
flow is insufficient to drive the turbine. No
turbocharger pressure is generated in this
way.

Under dynamic operating conditions, 
the torque output remains similar to that 
of a conventionally aspirated engine even at
medium engine speeds (c). This is because of
the delay in the build-up of the exhaust-gas
flow. On acceleration from slow speeds,
therefore, the “turbo lag” effect occurs.

On gasoline engines in particular, the turbo
lag can be minimized by utilizing the dy-
namic supercharging effect. This improves
the turbocharger’s response characteristics.

On diesel engines, the use of turbochargers
with variable turbine geometry provides a
means of significantly reducing turbo lag.

Another design variation is the electrically 
assisted turbocharger which is aided by an
electric motor. The motor accelerates the im-
peller on the compressor side of the turbo -
charger independently of the exhaust-gas
flow through the turbine, thereby reducing
turbo lag. This type of turbocharger is cur-
rently in the course of development.

A rapid development of turbocharger pres-
sure at low speeds can also be achieved using
two-stage turbocharging. Two-stage turbo -
charging stands at the beginning of series-
production launch.

The response of turbocharged engines as
 altitude increases is very good because the
pressure differential is greater at lower atmos-
pheric pressure. This partially offsets the
lower density of air. However, the design of
the turbocharger must ensure that the tur-
bine does not over-rev in such conditions.

Multistage turbocharging
Multistage turbocharging is an improvement
on single-stage turbocharging in that power
limits can be significantly extended. The ob-
jective here is to improve air supply under
both steady-state and dynamic operating 
conditions and at the same time improve the
specific fuel consumption of the engine. Two
methods of turbocharging have proved suc-
cessful in this respect.

Sequential supercharging
Sequential supercharging involves the use of
multiple turbochargers connected in parallel
which successively cut in as engine load in-
creases. Thus, in comparison with a single
larger turbocharger which is geared to the 
engine’s rated power output, two or more op-
timum levels of operation can be obtained.
Because of the added expense of the super-
charger sequencing control system, however,
sequential supercharging is predominantly
used on marine propulsion  systems or gener-
ator engines.

Controlled two-stage turbocharging
Controlled two-stage turbocharging involves
two differently dimensioned turbochargers
connected in series with a controlled bypass
and, ideally, two intercoolers (Fig. 6, 1 and 2).
The first turbocharger is a low-pressure tur-
bocharger (1) and the second, a high-pressure
turbocharger (2). The intake air first under-

goes precompression by the low-pressure 
turbocharger. Consequently, the  relatively
small high-pressure compressor in the second
turbocharger is operating at a higher input
pressure with a low volumetric flow rate, so
that it can deliver the  required air-mass flow
rate. A particularly high level of compressor
efficiency can be achieved with two-stage 
turbocharging.

At lower engine speeds, the bypass valve (5)

is closed, so that both turbochargers are
working. This provides for very rapid devel-
opment of a high turbocharger pressure. 
As engine speed increases, the bypass valve
gradually opens until eventually only the low-
pressure turbocharger is operating. In this
way, the turbocharging system adjusts evenly
to the engine’s requirements.

This method of turbocharging is used in
 automotive applications because of its
straightforward control characteristics.

Electric booster
This is an additional compressor mounted
upstream of the turbocharger. It is similar in
design to the turbocharger’s compressor but
is driven by an electric motor. Under acceler-
ation, the electric booster supplies the  engine
with extra air, thereby improving its  response
characteristics at low speeds in  particular.

Supercharging
A supercharger consists of a compressor dri-
ven directly by the engine. The engine and the
compressor are generally rigidly linked, e.g.
by a belt drive system. Compared with tur-
bochargers, superchargers are rarely used on
diesel engines.

Positive-displacement supercharger
The most common type of supercharger is
the positive-displacement supercharger. It is
used mainly on small and medium-sized car
engines. The following types of supercharger
are used on diesel engines:

Positive-displacement supercharger with
 internal compression
With this type of supercharger, the air is com-
pressed inside the compressor. The types used
on diesel engines are the reciprocating-piston
supercharger and the helical-vane super-
charger.

Reciprocating-piston supercharger: This type
has either a rigid piston (Fig. 7) or a dia -
phragm (Fig. 8). A piston (similar to an en-
gine piston) compresses the air which then
passes through an outlet valve to the engine
cylinder.

Helical-vane supercharger (Fig. 9): Two  inter-
meshing helical vanes (4) compress the air.

Positive-displacement supercharger without in-
ternal compression
With this type of supercharger, the air is 
compressed outside of the supercharger 
by the action of the fluid flow generated. The
only example of this type to be used on diesel
engines was the Roots supercharger (Fig. 10)
which was fitted to some two-stroke diesels.

Roots supercharger: Two contra-rotating
 rotary vanes (2) linked by gears rotate in con-
tact with one another in similar fashion to a
gear pump and in that way compress the in-
take air.

Centrifugal supercharger
In addition to the positive-displacement
 superchargers, there are also centrifugal su-
perchargers (centrifugal-flow compressors) 
in which the compressor is similar to that in 
a turbocharger. In order to obtain the high
 peripheral velocity required, they are driven
via a system of gears. This type of super-
charger offers good volumetric efficiency over
a wide range of speeds and can be seen as an
alternative to the turbocharger for small en-
gines. Mechanical centrifugal superchargers
are also known as mechanical centrifugal
turbo-compressors. Centrifugal  turbo-
chargers are rarely used on medium-sized or
larger car engines.

Controlling supercharger pressure
The pressure generated by a supercharger can
be controlled by means of a bypass. A propor-
tion of the compressed air flow enters the
cylinder and determines the cylinder charge.
The remainder flows through the  bypass and
is returned to the intake side. The bypass valve
is controlled by the engine control unit.

Advantages and disadvantages of
 supercharging
Because the supercharger is driven directly by
the crankshaft, any increase in engine speed is
instantaneously mirrored by an increase in
compressor speed. This means that under

 dynamic operating conditions, higher engine
torque and better response characteristics are
obtained than with a turbocharger. If variable-
speed gearing is used, the engine response to
load changes can also be improved.

Since, however, the necessary power output for
driving the compressor (approx. 10...15 kW for
cars) is not available as effective engine output,
those advantages are offset by a somewhat
higher rate of fuel consumption than with a
turbocharger. That disadvantage is mitigated 
if the compressor can be  disconnected at low
engine speeds and loads by means of a clutch
operated by the engine control unit. This, on
the other hand, makes the supercharger more
expensive to produce. Another disadvantage 
of the supercharger is the greater amount of
space it requires.

Dynamic supercharging
A degree of supercharging can be achieved
simply by the utilization of dynamic effects in
the intake manifold. Dynamic supercharging
effects of this type are less important in diesel
engines than they are for gasoline engines. In
diesel engines, the main emphasis of intake-
manifold design is on even distribution of the
air charge between all cylinders and distribu-
tion of the recirculated exhaust gas. In addi-
tion, the creation of whirl effects inside the
cylinders is also of importance. At the relatively
low speeds at which diesel engines run, design-
ing the intake manifold specifically to obtain
dynamic supercharging effects would require it
to be extremely long. Since virtually all mod-
ern diesel engines are equipped with tur-
bochargers, the only benefit that could be
achieved would be under non steady-state 
operating conditions where the turbocharger
has not reached full delivery pressure.

In general, the intake manifold on a diesel 
engine is kept as short as possible. The advan-
tages of this are
(cid:2) Improved dynamic response characteristics

and

(cid:2) Better control characteristics on the part of

the exhaust-gas recirculation system

56

Cylinder-charge control systems

Swirl flaps

Swirl flaps

The pattern of air flow inside of the cylinders
of a diesel engine has a fundamental  effect on
mixture formation. It is mainly  influenced by:
(cid:1) The air flow generated by the injection jets. 
(cid:1) The movement of air flowing into the

cylinder.

(cid:1) The movement of the piston.

The whirl-assisted combustion process swirls
the air during the induction and compression
cycles to obtain rapid, complete mixture for-
mation. Using special flaps and channels, the
whirl can be regulated depending on engine
speed and load. 

The intake ducts are designed as fill channels
(Fig. 1, 5) and swirl passages (2). The fill chan-
nels can be closed by a flap (swirl flap; 6). 
The flap is controlled by the engine control
unit, depending on the program map. Besides a
simple system with two positions, “Open” and
“Closed”, there are also position-controlled sys-
tems that allow intermediate positions. 

1

Intake-duct switchoff (example)

The swirl flap is closed at low engine speeds.
Air is sucked in via the swirl passage. The
whirl is stronger when the cylinder charge 
is fuller. 

At high engine speeds, the flap opens 
and releases the fill channels (5) to allow a
greater cylinder charge and improve engine
performance. Whirl is then reduced. 

By controlling whirl as a function of the pro-
gram map, it is possible to make significant
cuts in NOx and particulate emissions in the
lower rev band. Flow losses caused by closing
off the passages lead to increased charge- cycle
work. However, improving mixture formation
and combustion compensate more or less for
any additional fuel consumption. A compro-
mise between optimizing emission, fuel con-
sumption, and performance is achieved
 dependent on engine load and speed.

Intake-duct switchoff is presently fitted 
to some car engines and is playing an
 increasingly important role in the emis sion-
minimization concept. 

However, modern truck diesel engines op-
erate generally at very low whirl rates. Due to

their smaller speed range and
larger combustion chambers, the
energy of the injection jets are suf-
ficient to allow mixture formation.

give it the required structural strength, wet
rigidity, and chemical resistance.

The elements are changed at intervals spec-

ified by the vehicle manufacturer.

The demands for small and highly efficient
filter elements (smaller space requirements)
that also offer longer servicing intervals is 
the driving force behind the development 
of innovative, new air-filter media. New air-
filter media made of synthetic fibers (Fig. 1),
which have substantially improved perfor-
mance figures in some cases, are already in
production. 

Better results than with purely cellulose-based
media can be achieved using composite mate-
rials (e.g. paper with melt-blown layer) and
special nano-fiber filter media, which consist
of a relatively coarse base layer made of cellu-
lose on which ultra-thin fibers with diameters
of only 30 to 40 nm are applied. New folded
structures with alternately sealed channels,
similar to diesel soot filters, are soon to be
launched on the market.

Conical, oval, and stepped or trapezoidal
geometries add to the range of shapes avail-
able in order to optimize use of the space un-
der the hood, which is becoming ever more
confined.

1

Air-filter medium made of synthetic fibers

Intake air filters

The air filter filters the engine intake air and
prevents any mineral dust or particles from
entering the engine and becoming entrained
in the engine oil. This reduces wear in the
bearings, piston rings, cylinder walls, etc. 
It also protects the sensitive air-mass meter 
by preventing dust from depositing there. 
If this should happen, it could result in incor-
rect signals, higher fuel consumption, and
higher pollutant emissions.

Typical air impurities include oil mist,
aerosols, diesel soot, industrial waste gases,
pollen, and dust. Dust particles drawn in
 together with the intake air have diameters
that range from approx. 0.01 µm (soot parti-
cles) to approx. 2 mm (sand grains).

Filter medium and design 
The air filters are normally deep-bed filters
that retain particles in the filter-medium
structure – as opposed to surface filters.
Deep-bed filters with high dust retention
 capacities are always preferred when large
volumetric flows with low particle concentra-
tions need to be filtered efficiently.

Pressures achieve mass-related, overall sep-
aration efficiencies of up to 99.8 bar (passen-
ger cars) and 99.95 bar (commercial vehicles).
Such figures must be capable of being main-
tained under all prevailing conditions, includ-
ing the dynamic conditions that exist in the
air-intake system of an  engine (pulsation).
Filters of inadequate quality have greater dust
passage rates under such  circumstances.
The filter elements are individually de-
signed for each engine. In this way, pressure
losses can be kept to a minimum, and the
high filtration rates are not dependent on 
the air-flow rate. The filter elements, which
may be rectangular or cylindrical, consist of a
filter medium that is folded so that the maxi-
mum possible filter surface area can be ac-
commodated within the smallest possible
space. 
Generally cellulose-fiber based, the filter
medium is compressed and impregnated to

Helmholtz resonators and lambda quarter
pipes for acoustics. With the aid of this type
of overall system optimization, the individual
components can be better matched to one 
another. This helps to comply with the ever
stricter noise-output restrictions. 

Increasingly in demand are water-separating
components, which are integrated in the 
air-intake system. They are used primarily to
protect the air-mass sensor, which measures
the air-mass flow. Water droplets which are
drawn in through poorly situated intake fit-
tings in the event of heavy rain, heavy splash
water (e.g., on off-road vehicles) or snowfall
and which reach the sensor can cause incor-
rect cylinder-charge readings to be taken. 

Mufflers
Previously, air-filter housings were almost ex-
clusively designed as “muffler filters”. Their
large volume was designed for the supple-
mentary function of reducing air  intake
noise. In the meantime, the two functions of
filtration and engine-noise reduction have
become increasingly separated and the differ-
ent components independently optimized.
This means that the filter housing can be re-
duced in size. And that results in very slim 
filters which can be integrated in the engine
trim covers while the mufflers are placed in
less accessible positions inside the engine
compartment.

Air filters for cars
In addition to the housing (1 and 3) with the
cylindrical air-filter element, the passenger-
car air-intake module (Fig. 2) incorporates all
the intake ducts (5 and 6) and the air-intake
module (4). Arranged in-between are

Splash plates or cyclone-like designs installed
in the intake duct are used to separate out the
water droplets. The shorter the distance from
the air intake to the filter element, the more
difficult it is to obtain a solution because only
very low flow-pressure losses are permitted.
However, it is also possible to use appropri-
ately fitted filter elements which collect (coa-
lesce) the water droplets and deflect the water
film outwards ahead of the actual particulate-
filter element. A housing specially designed
for this purposes aids this process. This
arrangement can also be successfully used for
water separation even in the case of very short
raw-air ducts.

Air filters for commercial vehicles
Figure 3 shows an easy-to-maintain and
weight-optimized plastic air filter for com-
mercial vehicles. In addition to having a very
high filtration rate, the elements for this filter
are dimensioned for servicing intervals of
over 100,000 km. The servicing intervals are
thus significantly longer than those for pas-
senger cars.

In countries with high levels of atmos-
pheric dust, and on construction and agricul-
tural machines, a pre-filter is fitted upstream
of the filter element. The pre-filter filters out
coarse-grained, heavy dust particles, thereby
substantially increasing the  service life of the
fine filter element.

In its most simple form, it is a ring of deflec-
tor vanes which set the air flow into a rotating
motion. The resulting centrifugal force sepa-
rates out the coarse dust particles. However,
only mini-cyclone pre-filter batteries opti-
mized for use in conjunction with the main
filter element can properly utilize the poten-
tial of centrifugal separators in commercial-
vehicle air filters.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Mixture distribution

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

The combustion processes in the diesel 
engine, also linked to engine performance,
fuel consumption, exhaust-gas composition,
and combustion noise, depend to a great 
extent on how the air/fuel mixture is pre-
pared. 

The fuel-injection parameters that are deci-
sive on the quality of the mixture formation
are primarily:
(cid:1) start of injection
(cid:1) rate-of-discharge curve and injection

 duration

(cid:1) injection pressure
(cid:1) number of injection events

On the diesel engine, exhaust-gas and noise
emissions are largely reduced by measures in-
side of the engine, i.e. combustion-process
control.

Until the 1980s injected fuel quantity and
start of injection were controlled on vehicle
engines by mechanical means only. However,
compliance with prevailing emission limits
requires the high-precision adjustment of in-
jection parameters, e.g. pre-injection, main
injection, injected fuel quantity, injection
pressure, and start of injection, adapted to 
the engine operating state. This is only
achievable using an electronic control unit
that calculates injection parameters as 
a factor of temperature, engine speed, load,
altitude (elevation), etc. Electronic Diesel
Control (EDC) has generally become wide-
spread on diesel engines.

As exhaust-gas emission standards become
more severe in future, further measures for
minimizing pollutants will have to be intro-
duced. Emissions, as well as combustion
noise, can continue to be reduced by means
of very high injection pressures, as achieved
by the Unit Injector System, and by a rate-of-
discharge curve that is adjustable indepen-
dent of pressure buildup, as implemented by
the common-rail system.

Mixture distribution

Excess-air factor λ
The excess-air factor λ (lambda) was intro-
duced to indicate the degree by which the 
actual air/fuel mixture actually deviates from
the stoichiometric1) mass ratio. It indicates
the ratio of intake air mass to required air
mass for stoichiometric combustion, thus:

λ =

Air mass
Fuel mass · Stoichiometric ratio

λ = 1: The intake air mass is equal to the air
mass theoretically required to burn all of the
fuel injected. 

λ < 1: The intake air mass is less than the
amount required and therefore the mixture 
is rich. 

λ > 1: The intake air mass is greater than the
amount required and therefore the mixture 
is lean.

1) The stoichiometric ratio indicates the air mass in kg
 required to completely burn 1 kg of fuel (mL/mK). 
For diesel fuel, this is approx. 14.5.

Lambda levels in diesel engines
Rich areas of mixture are responsible for
sooty combustion. In order to prevent the
formation of too many rich areas of mixture,
diesel engines – in contrast to gasoline en-
gines – have to be run with an overall  excess
of air.

The lambda levels for turbocharged diesel
engines at full load are between λ = 1.15 and
λ = 2.0. When idling and under no-load con-
ditions, those figures rise to λ >10.

These excess-air factors represent the ratio of
total masses of fuel and air in the cylinder.
However, the lambda factor, which is subject
to strong spatial fluctuation, is primarily 
responsible for auto-ignition and the produc-
tion of pollutants.

Diesel engines operate with heterogeneous
mixture formation and auto-ignition. It is not
possible to achieve completely homogeneous
mixing of the injected fuel with the air charge
prior to or during combustion. Within the
heterogeneous mixture encountered in a
diesel engine, the localized excess-air factors
can cover the entire range from λ = 0 (pure
fuel) in the eye of the jet close to the injector
to λ = ∞ (pure air) at the outer extremities of
the spray jet. Around the outer zone of a sin-
gle liquid droplet (vapor envelope), there are
localized lambda levels of 0.3 to 1.5 (Figs. 2
and 3). From this, it can be deduced that op-
timized atomization (large numbers of very

small droplets), high levels of excess air, and
“metered” motion of the air charge produce
large numbers of localized zones with lean,
combustible lambda levels. This results in less
soot occurring during combustion.
EGR compatibility then rises, and NOx emis-
sions are reduced.

Optimized fuel atomization is achieved by
high injection pressures that range up to max.
2,200 bar for UIS. Common-rail systems
(CRS) operate at an injection pressure of
max. 1,800 bar. This results is a high relative
velocity between the jet of fuel and the air in
the cylinder which has the effect of scattering
the fuel jet.

With a view to reducing engine weight and
cost, the aim is to obtain as much power as
possible from a given engine capacity. 
To achieve this, the engine must run on the
lowest possible excess air at high loads. 
On the other hand, a deficiency in excess 
air increases the amount of soot emissions.
Therefore, soot has to be limited by precisely
metering the injected fuel quantity to match
the available air mass as a factor of engine
speed.

Low atmospheric pressures (e.g. at high 
altitudes) also require the fuel volume to be
adjusted to the smaller amount of available
air.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Fuel-injection parameters

Start of injection and delivery
Start of injection
The point at which injection of fuel into the
combustion chamber starts has a decisive
 effect on the point at which combustion of
the air/fuel mixture starts, and therefore on
emission levels, fuel consumption and com-
bustion noise. For this reason, start of injec-
tion plays a major role in optimizing engine
performance characteristics.

Start of injection specifies the position stated
in degrees of crankshaft rotation relative to
crankshaft Top Dead Center (TDC) at 
which the injection nozzle opens, and fuel 
is injected into the engine combustion cham-
ber.

The position of the piston relative to top
dead center at that moment influences the
flow of air inside of the combustion chamber,
as well as air density and temperature. Ac-
cordingly, the degree of mixing of air and fuel
is also dependent on start of injection. Thus,

start of injection affects emissions such as
soot, nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hy-
drocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide
(CO).

The start-of-injection setpoints vary accord-
ing to engine load, speed, and temperature.
Optimized values are determined for each en-
gine, taking into consideration the impacts
on fuel consumption, pollutant emission, 
and noise. These values are then stored in a
start-of-injection program map (Fig. 4).
Load-dependent start-of-injection variability
is controlled across the program map.

Compared with cam-controlled systems,
common-rail systems offer more freedom in 
selecting the quantity and timing of injection
events and injection pressure. As a consequence,
fuel pressure is built up by a separate high-pres-
sure pump, optimized to every operating point
by the engine management system, and fuel 
injection is controlled by a solenoid valve or
piezoelectric element.

Fuel-injection parameters

63

Standard values for start of injection
On a diesel-engine data map, the optimum
points of combustion start for low fuel con-
sumption are in the range of 0...8° crankshaft
angle before TDC. As a result, and based on
statutory exhaust-gas emission limits, the
start of injection points are as  follows:

Retarded start of injection
A retarded start of injection at low-load con-
ditions can result in incomplete combustion
and, therefore, in the emission of unburned
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide
(CO) since the temperature in the combustion
chamber is already dropping (Fig. 5).

Direct-injection car engines:
(cid:1) No load: 2° crankshaft angle before TDC to

4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:1) Part load: 6° crankshaft angle before TDC

to 4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:1) Full load: 6 to 15° crankshaft angle before

TDC

TDC

Direct-injection commercial-vehicle engines 
(without exhaust-gas recirculation):
(cid:1) No load: 4 to 12° crankshaft angle before

(cid:1) Full load: 3 to 6° crankshaft angle before
TDC to 2° crankshaft angle after TDC

When the engine is cold, the start of injection
for car and commercial-vehicle engines is 3 
to 10° earlier. Combustion time at full load is
40 to 60° crankshaft angle.

Advanced start of injection
The highest compression temperature (final
compression temperature) occurs shortly
 before piston Top Dead Center (TDC). If 
combustion starts a long way before TDC,
combustion pressure rises steeply, and acts 
as a retarding force against the piston stroke.
Heat lost in the process diminishes engine
 efficiency and, therefore, increases fuel con-
sumption. The steep rise in compression pres-
sure also makes combustion much noisier.
An advanced start of injection increases
temperature in the combustion chamber. 
As a result, NOx emission levels rise, but 
HC emissions are lower (Fig. 5).

Minimizing blue and white smoke levels
 requires advanced start of injection and/or
pre-injection when the engine is cold.

The partially conflicting tradeoffs of specific
fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions
on the one hand, and soot (black smoke) and
NOx emissions on the other,  demand com-
promises and very tight tolerances when
modifying the start of injection to suit a par-
ticular engine.

Start of delivery
In addition to start of injection, start of
 delivery is another aspect that is often consid-
ered. It relates to the point at which the fuel-
injection pump starts to deliver fuel to the 
injector.

On older fuel-injection systems, start of 
delivery plays an important role since the 
in-line or distributor injection pump must be
allocated to the engine. The relative timing
between pump and engine is fixed at start of
delivery, since this is easier to define than the
actual start of injection. This is made possible
because there is a definite relationship be-
tween start of delivery and start of injection
(injection lag 1)).

Injection lag results from the time it takes

the pressure wave to travel from the high-
pressure pump through to the injection noz-
zle. Therefore, it depends on the length of the
line. At different engine speeds, there is a dif-
ferent injection lag measured as a crankshaft
angle (degrees of crankshaft rotation). At
higher engine speeds, the engine has a greater
ignition lag 2) related to the crankshaft posi-
tion (in degrees of crankshaft angle). Both 
of these effects must be compensated for –
which is why a fuel-injection system must be
able to adjust the start of delivery/start of in-
jection in response to engine speed, load, and
temperature.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Injected-fuel quantity
The required fuel mass, me, for an engine
cylinder per power stroke is calculated using
the following equation:

me =

P · be · 33.33
n · z

[mg/stroke]

where:
P engine power in kilowatts
be engine specific fuel

consumption in g/kWh

n engine speed in rpm 
z number of engine cylinders

Injection duration
One of the main parameters of the rate-of-
discharge curve is injection duration. During
this period, the injection nozzle is open, and
fuel flows into the combustion chamber. This
parameter is specified in degrees of crank-
shaft or camshaft angle, or in milli seconds.
Different diesel combustion processes require
different injection durations, as  illustrated by
the following examples  (approximate figures
at rated output):
(cid:1) Passenger-car direct-injection (DI) engine 

approx. 32...38° crankshaft angle

(cid:1) Indirect-injection car engines: 35...40° 

The corresponding fuel volume (injected fuel
quantity), QH, in mm3/stroke or mm3/injec-
tion cycle is then:

crankshaft angle

(cid:1) Direct-injection commercial-vehicle
engines: 25...36° crankshaft angle 

A crankshaft angle of 30° during injection
duration is equivalent to a camshaft angle 
of 15°. This results in an injection pump
speed 1) of 2,000 rpm, equivalent to an injec-
tion duration of 1.25 ms.

In order to minimize fuel consumption and
emissions, the injection duration must be de-
fined as a factor of the operating point and
start of injection (Figs. 6 through 9).

1) Equivalent to half the engine speed on four-stroke engines

QH =

P · be · 1,000
30 · n · z ·(cid:0)

[mm3/stroke]

Fuel density, (cid:0), in g/cm3 is temperature-
 dependent.

Engine power output at an assumed con-
stant level of efficiency (η~1/be) is directly
proportional to the injected fuel quantity.

The fuel mass injected by the fuel-injection
system depends on the following variables:
(cid:1) The fuel-metering cross-section of the

 injection nozzle

(cid:1) The injection duration
(cid:1) The variation over time of the difference
between the injection pressure and the
pressure in the combustion chamber

(cid:1) The density of the fuel

Diesel fuel is compressible, i.e it is com-
pressed at high pressures. This increases 
the injected fuel quantity. The deviation be-
tween the setpoint quantity in the program
map and the actual quantity impacts on per-
formance and pollutant emissions. In high-
precision fuel-injection systems controlled by
electronic diesel control, the required  injected
fuel quantity can be metered with a high 
degree of accuracy.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Rate-of-discharge curve
The rate-of-discharge curve describes the
fuel-mass flow plotted against time when in-
jected into the combustion chamber  during
the injection duration.

Rate-of-discharge curve on cam-controlled
fuel-injection systems
On cam-controlled fuel-injection systems,
pressure is built up continuously throughout
the injection process by the fuel-injection
pump. Thus, the speed of the pump has a 
direct impact on fuel delivery rate and, 
consequently, on injection pressure.

Port-controlled distributor and in-line
fuel-injection pumps do not permit any  
pre-injection. With two-spring nozzle-and-
holder assemblies, however, the injection rate
can be reduced at the start of injection to 
improve combustion noise.

Pre-injection is also possible with sole-
noid-valve controlled distributor injection
pumps. Unit Injector Systems (UIS) for
 passenger cars are equipped with hydro -
mechanical pre-injection, but its control 
is only limited in time.

Pressure generation and delivery of the
 injected fuel quantity are interlinked by 
the cam and the injection pump in cam-
controlled systems. This has the following 
impacts on injection characteristics:

(cid:1) Injection pressure rises as engine speed and
injected fuel quantity increase, and until
maximum pressure is reached (Fig. 10).
(cid:1) Injection pressure rises at the start of injec-
tion, but drops back to nozzle-closing pres-
sure before the end of injection (starting at
end of delivery).

The consequences of this are as follows:
(cid:1) Small injected fuel quantities are injected at

lower pressure.

(cid:1) The rate-of-discharge curve is approxi-

mately triangular in shape.

This triangular curve promotes combustion
in part-load and at low engine speeds since it
achieves a shallower rise, and thus quieter
combustion; however, this curve is less bene-
ficial at full-load as a square curve achieves
better air efficiency.

On indirect-injection engines (engines
with prechamber or whirl chambers), throt-
tling-pintle nozzles are used to produce a 
single jet of fuel and define the rate-of-dis-
charge curve. This type of injection nozzle
controls the outlet cross-section as a function
of needle lift. It produces a gradual  increase
in pressure and, consequently, “quiet combus-
tion”.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

67

Since the electronic control unit triggers the
injectors, start of injection, injection dura-
tion, and injection pressure are freely defin-
able for the various engine operating points
in an engine application. They are controlled
by Electronic Diesel Control (EDC). EDC
balances out injected-fuel-quantity spread in
individual injectors by means of injector de-
livery compensation (IMA).

Modern piezoelectric common-rail fuel-in-
jection systems permit several pre-injection
and secondary injection events. In fact, up 
to five injection events are possible during 
a power cycle.

Rate-of-discharge curve in the
common-rail system
A high-pressure pump generates the fuel-rail
pressure independently of the injection cycle.
Injection pressure during the injection
process is virtually constant (Fig. 11). At a
given system pressure, the injected fuel quan-
tity is proportional to the length of time the
injector is open, and it is independent of en-
gine or pump speed (time-based injection).

This results in an almost square rate-of-dis-
charge curve which intensifies with short in-
jection durations and the almost constant,
high spray velocities at full-load, thus permit-
ting higher specific power outputs.

However, this is not beneficial to combustion
noise since a large quantity of fuel is  injected
during ignition lag because of the high injec-
tion rate at the start of injection. This leads to
a high pressure rise during  premixed com-
bustion. As it is possible to  exclude up to two
pre-injection events, the combustion cham-
ber can be precon ditioned. This shortens 
ignition lag and achieves the lowest possible
noise emissions.

Injection functions
Depending on the application for which the
engine is intended, the following injection
functions are required (Fig. 12):
(cid:1) Pre-injection (1) reduces combustion noise

and NOx emissions, in particular 
on DI engines.

(cid:1) Positive-pressure gradient during the main
injection event (3) reduces NOx emissions
on engines without exhaust-gas recircula-
tion.

(cid:1) Two-stage pressure gradient (4) during 
the main injection event reduces NOx
and soot emissions on engines without 
exhaust-gas recirculation.

(cid:1) Constant high pressure during the main in-
jection event (3, 7) reduces soot emissions

gas recirculation.

Pre-injection
The pressure and temperature levels in the
cylinder at the point of main injection rise 
 if a small fuel quantity (approx. 1 mg) is
burned during the compression phase. This
shortens the ignition lag of the main injection
event and has a positive impact on combus-
tion noise, since the proportion of fuel in the

13

Effect of pre-injection on combustion-pressure 
pattern

premixed combustion process decreases. At
the same time the quantity of diffuse fuel
combusted increases. This increases soot and
NOx emissions, also due to the higher temper-
ature prevailing in the cylinder.

On the other hand, the higher combustion-
chamber temperatures are favorable mainly at
cold start and in the low load range in order
to stabilize combustion and reduce HC and
CO emissions.

A good compromise between combustion

noise and NOx emissions is obtainable by
adapting the time interval between pre-injec-
tion and main injection dependent on the 
operating point, and metering the pre-in-
jected fuel quantity.

Retarded secondary injection
With retarded secondary injection, fuel is 
not combusted, but is evaporated by residual
heat in the exhaust gas. The secondary-injec-
tion phase follows the main-injection phase
during the expansion or exhaust stroke at a
point up to 200° crankshaft angle after TDC.
It injects a precisely metered quantity of fuel
into the exhaust gas. The resulting mixture of
fuel and exhaust gas is expelled through the
exhaust ports into the exhaust-gas system
during the exhaust stroke.

Retarded secondary injection is mainly
used to supply hydrocarbons which also cause
an increase in exhaust-gas temperature by ox-
idation in an oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter. This measure is used to regenerate
downstream exhaust-gas treatment systems,
such as particulate filters or NOx accumula-
tor-type catalytic converters.

Since retarded secondary injection may
cause thinning of the engine oil by the diesel
fuel, it needs clarification with the engine
manufacturer. 

Advanced secondary injection
On the common-rail system, secondary injec-
tion can occur directly after main injection
while combustion is still taking place. In this
way, soot particles are reburned, and soot
emissions can be reduced by 20 to 70%.

Timing characteristics of fuel-injection
 systems
Figure 14 presents an example of a radial-pis-
ton distributor pump (VP44). The cam on
the cam ring starts delivery, and fuel then ex-
its from the nozzle. It shows that pressure and
injection patterns vary greatly between the
pump and the nozzle, and are determined by
the characteristics of the components that
control injection (cam, pump, high-pressure
valve, fuel line, and nozzle). For this reason,
the fuel-injection system must be precisely
matched to the engine.

The characteristics are similar for all fuel-
injection systems in which pressure is gener-
ated by a pump plunger (in-line injection
pumps, unit injectors, and unit pumps).

Detrimental volume in conventional 
 injection systems
The term “detrimental volume” refers to the
volume of fuel on the high-pressure side of
the fuel-injection system. This is made up of
the high-pressure side of the fuel-injection
pump, the high-pressure fuel lines, and the
volume of the nozzle-and-holder assembly.
Every time fuel is injected, the detrimental
volume is pressurized and depressurized. As a
result, compression losses occur, thus retard-
ing injection lag. The fuel volume inside of
the pipes is compressed by the dynamic
processes generated by the pressure wave.

The greater the detrimental volume, the
poorer the hydraulic efficiency of the fuel-in-
jection system. A major consideration when
developing a fuel-injection system is, there-
fore, to minimize detrimental volume as
much as possible. The unit injector system
has the smallest detrimental volume.

In order to guarantee uniform control of
the engine, the detrimental volume must be
equal for all cylinders.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Fuel-injection parameters

Injection pressure
The process of fuel injection uses pressure 
in the fuel system to induce the flow of fuel
through the injector jets. A high fuel-system
pressure results in a high rate of fuel outflow
at the injection nozzle. Fuel atomization is
caused by the collision of the turbulent jet 
of fuel with the air inside of the combustion
chamber. Therefore, the higher the relative
velocity between fuel and air, and the higher
the density of the air, the more finely the fuel
is atomized. The injection pressure at the
nozzle may be higher than in the fuel-
 injection pump because of the length of 
the high-pressure fuel line, whose length 
is matched to the reflected pressure wave.

Direct-injection (DI) engines
On diesel engines with direct injection, the
velocity of the air inside of the combustion
chamber is relatively slow since it only moves
as a result of its mass moment of inertia
(i.e. the air “attempts” to maintain the velocity
at which it enters the cylinder; this causes
whirl). The piston stroke intensifies whirl in
the cylinder since the restricted flow forces
the air into the piston recess, and thus into a
smaller diameter. In general, however, air mo-
tion is less and in indirect-injection engines.

15

Influence of injection pressure and start of injection on
fuel consumption, soot and nitrogen-oxide emissions

The fuel must be injected at high pressure
due to low air flow. Modern direct-injection
systems now generate full-load peak pressures
of 1,000...2,050 bar for car engines, and
1,000...2,200 bar for commercial vehicles.
However, peak pressure is available only at
higher engine speeds – except on the com-
mon-rail system.

A decisive factor to obtain an ideal torque
curve with low-smoke operation (i.e. with 
low particulate emission) is a relatively high
injection pressure adapted to the combustion
process at low full-load engine speeds. Since
the air density in the cylinder is relatively low
at low engine speeds, injection pressure must
be limited to avoid depositing fuel on the
cylinder wall. Above about 2,000 rpm, the
maximum charge-air pressure becomes avail-
able, and injection pressure can rise to maxi-
mum.

To obtain ideal engine efficiency, fuel must be
injected within a specific, engine-speed-de-
pendent angle window on either side of TDC.
At high engine speeds (rated output), there-
fore, high injection pressures are required to
shorten the injection duration.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
On diesel engines with divided combustion
chambers, rising combustion pressure expels
the charge out of the prechamber or whirl
chamber into the main combustion chamber.
This process runs at high air velocities in the
whirl chamber, in the connecting  passage 
between the whirl chamber, and the main
combustion chamber.

Basic principles of diesel fuel injection

Nozzle and nozzle holder designs

71

Nozzle and nozzle holder
 designs

Secondary injection
Unintended secondary injection has a par-
ticularly undesirable effect on exhaust-gas
quality. Secondary injection occurs when the
injection nozzle shortly re-opens after clos-
ing and allows poorly conditioned fuel to 
be injected into the cylinder at a late stage 
in the combustion process. This fuel is not
completely burned, or may not be burned 
at all, with the result that it is released into
the exhaust gas as unburned hydrocarbons.
This undesirable effect can be prevented by
rapidly closing nozzle-and-holder assem-
blies, at sufficiently high closing pressure
and low static pressure in the supply line.

Dead volume
Dead volume in the injection nozzle on the
cylinder side of the needle-seal seats has a
similar effect to secondary injection. The
fuel accumulated in such a volume runs into
the combustion chamber on completion of
combustion, and partly escapes into the ex-
haust pipe. This fuel component similarly
increases the level of unburned hydrocar-
bons in the exhaust gas (Fig. 1). Sac-less

(vco) nozzles, in which the injection orifices
are drilled into the needle-seal seats, have
the smallest dead volume.

Injection direction 
Direct-injection (DI) engines
Diesel engines with direct injection generally
have hole-type nozzles with between 4 and
10 injection orifices (most commonly 6 to 8
injection orifices) arranged as centrally as
possible. The injection direction is very pre-
cisely matched to the combustion chamber.
Divergences of the order of only 2 degrees
from the optimum injection direction lead
to a detectable increase in soot emission and
fuel consumption.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
Indirect-injection engines use pintle nozzles
with only a single injection jet. The nozzle
injects the fuel into the precombustion or
whirl chamber in such a way that the glow
plug is just within the injection jet. The in-
jection direction is matched precisely to the
combustion chamber. Any deviations in in-
jection direction result in poorer utilization
of combustion air and, therefore, to an in-
crease in soot and hydrocarbon emissions.

Overview of diesel fuel-injection systems

The fuel-injection system injects fuel into the
combustion chamber at high pressure, at the
right time, and in the right quantity. The
main components of the fuel-injection sys-
tem are the injection pump that generates
high pressure, and the injection nozzles that
are linked to the injection pump via high-
pressure delivery lines – except with the Unit
Injector System. The injection nozzles pro-
ject into the combustion chamber of each
cylinder. 

In most systems, the nozzle opens when 
the fuel pressure reaches a specific opening
pressure, and closes when it drops below this
pressure. The nozzle is only controlled exter-
nally by an electronic controller in the com-
mon-rail system. 

Designs

The main differences between fuel-injection
systems are in the high-pressure generation
system, and in the control of start of injection
and injection duration. Whereas older sys-
tems still have mechanical control only, elec-
tronic control is now widespread. 

1

Operating concept of in-line fuel-injection pump

In-line fuel-injection pumps
Standard in-line fuel-injection pumps 
In-line fuel-injection pumps (Fig. 1) have 
a separate pump element consisting of a bar-
rel (1) and plunger (4) for each engine cylin-
der. The pump plunger is moved in the deliv-
ery direction (in this case upwards) by the
cam shaft (7) integrated in the fuel-injection
pump, is driven by the engine, and is returned
to its starting position by the plunger spring
(5). The individual pump units are generally
arranged in-line (hence the name in-line fuel-
injection pump).

The stroke of the plunger is invariable. The

point at which the top edge of the plunger
closes off the inlet port (2) on its upward
stroke marks the beginning of the pressure
generation phase. This point is referred to as
the start of delivery. The plunger continues to
move upwards. The fuel pressure therefore
increases, the nozzle opens and fuel is in-
jected into the combustion chamber. 

When the helix (3) of the plunger clears the
inlet port, fuel can escape and pressure is lost.
The nozzle closes and fuel injection ceases. 

The piston travel between opening and clos-

ing the inlet opening is the effective stroke.

The greater the effective stroke, the greater the
delivery quantity and injected fuel quantity. 
The pump plunger is turned by a control
rack to control the injected fuel quantity as a
factor of engine speed and load. This changes
the position of the helix relative to the inlet
opening, and thus the effective stroke. The
control rack is controlled by a mechanical
governor, or an electrical actuator. 

Injection pumps that work according to
this principle are called “port-controlled”. 

Control-sleeve in-line fuel-injection pumps
The control-sleeve in-line fuel-injection
pump has a control sleeve on the pump
plunger (Fig. 1, 8) to change the LPC – i.e. the
plunger lift to port closing – via an actuator
shaft that shifts the start of delivery. 

Control-sleeve in-line fuel-injection pumps
are always electronically controlled. The in-
jected fuel quantity and start of injection are
adjusted according to calculated setpoint 
values. 

With the standard in-line fuel-injection

pump, however, the start of injection is
 dependent on engine speed.

Distributor injection pumps
Distributor injection pumps have only one
pump unit that serves all cylinders (Figs. 2
and 3). A vane pump forces the fuel into the
high-pressure chamber (6). High pressure is
generated by an axial piston (Fig. 2, 4), or 
several radial pistons (Fig. 3, 4). A rotating
central distributor plunger opens and closes
metering slots (8) and spill ports, thereby dis-
tributing fuel to the individual engine cylin-
ders. The injection duration is controlled by 
a control collar (Fig. 2, 5) or a high-pressure
solenoid valve (Fig. 3, 5).

Axial-piston distributor pumps
A rotating cam plate (Fig. 2, 3) is driven 
by the engine. The number of cam lobes on
the bottom of the cam plate is equal to the
number of engine cylinders. They travel over
rollers (2) on the roller ring and thus cause
the distributor piston to describe a rotating as
well as a lifting motion. In the course of each
rotation of the drive shaft, the piston com-
pletes a number of strokes equal to the num-
ber of engine cylinders to be supplied.

In a port-controlled axial-piston distributor
pump with mechanical governor or electroni-
cally controlled actuator mechanism, a con-
trol collar (5) determines the effective stroke,
thereby controlling the injected-fuel quantity. 

The timing device can vary the pump’s start
of delivery by turning the roller ring.

Radial-piston distributor pumps
High pressure is generated by a radial-piston
pump with cam ring (Fig. 3, 3), and from two
to four radial pistons (4). Radial-piston
pumps can generate higher injection pres-
sures than axial-piston pumps. However, they
have to be capable of withstanding greater
mechanical stresses.

The cam ring can be rotated by the timing 
device (1), and this shifts the start of delivery.
With radial-piston distributor pumps, the
start of injection and injection duration are
always controlled by solenoid valve.

Solenoid-valve-controlled distributor
 injection pumps
With this type of distributor injection pump,
an electronically controlled high-pressure 
solenoid valve (5) meters the injected-fuel
quantity and varies the start of injection.
When the solenoid valve is closed, pressure
can build up in the high-pressure chamber
(6). When it is open, the fuel escapes so that
no pressure buildup occurs and therefore 
fuel injection is not possible. One or two 
electronic control units (pump control unit
and engine control unit) generate the control
and regulation signals.

Individual injection pumps type PF
Individual injection pumps of type PF (pump
with external drive) are directly driven by the
engine camshaft. They are mainly fitted to
marine engines, diesel locomotives, construc-
tion machinery, and low-power engines. 
Besides the cam for engine valve timing, the
engine camshaft has drive cams for the indi-
vidual injection pumps. 

Otherwise, the single-plunger fuel-injec-

tion pump of type PF basically operates 
in the same way as in-line fuel-injection
pumps. 

Overview of diesel fuel-injection systems

Unit Injector System (UIS)
In a Unit Injector System, UIS, the fuel-injec-
tion pump and the injection nozzle form a
single unit (Fig. 4). There is a unit injector 
fitted in the cylinder head for each cylinder. 
It is actuated either directly by a tappet, 
or indirectly by a rocker arm driven by the
engine camshaft. 

The integrated construction of the unit injec-
tor dispenses with the high-pressure line be-
tween the fuel-injection pump and the injec-
tion nozzle otherwise required on other fuel-
injection systems. The unit-injector system
can therefore be designed to operate at higher
injection pressures. The maximum injection
pressure is presently about 2,200 bar (on
commercial vehicles). 

The unit injector system is controlled elec-
tronically. An electronic control unit calcu-
lates start of injection and injection duration,
which are controlled by a high-pressure sole-
noid valve. 

Unit Pump System (UPS)
The modular Unit Pump System (UPS) oper-
ates on the same principle as the unit injector
system (Fig. 5). In contrast to the unit injec-
tor system, however, the nozzle-and-holder
assembly (2) and the fuel-injection pump are
linked by a short high-pressure line (3)
specifically designed for the system compo-
nents. This separation of high-pressure gen-
eration and nozzle-and-holder assembly al-
lows for a simpler attachment to the engine.
There is one unit pump assembly (fuel-injec-
tion pump, fuel line, and nozzle-and-holder
assembly) for each engine cylinder. The unit
pump assemblies are driven by the engine
camshaft (6).

As with the unit injector system, the unit
pump system uses an electronically controlled
fast-switching high-pressure solenoid valve
(4) to regulate injection duration and start of
injection.

Common-Rail system (CR)
In the common-rail pressure-accumulator
fuel-injection system, the functions of pres-
sure generation and fuel injection are sepa-
rate. This takes place by means of an accumu-
lator volume composed of the common rail
and the injectors (Fig. 6). Injection pressure 
is largely independent of engine speed or 
injected-fuel quantity, and is generated by a
high-pressure pump. This system thus offers 
a high degree of flexibility in designing the
fuel-injection process. 

Presently, pressures range up to 1,600 bar
(passenger cars) and 1,800 bar (commercial
vehicles).

Functional description
A presupply pump feeds fuel via a filter and
water separator to a high-pressure pump. The
high-pressure pump ensures that the required
fuel pressure in the rail is constantly high. 

The Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) calcu-
lates the injection point and injected fuel
quantity dependent on engine operating
state, ambient conditions, and rail pressure. 

Fuel is metered by controlling injection time
and injection pressure. Pressure is controlled
by the pressure-control valve which returns
excess fuel to the fuel tank. In a more recent
CR generation, metering is performed by a
metering unit in the low-pressure stage to
control the pump delivery rate. 

The injector is connected to the fuel rail by
short supply lines. Solenoid-valve injectors
were used on previous CR generations. The
latest system uses piezo-inline injectors. 
Their moves masses and inner friction 
has been reduced. This allows very short
 intervals between injection events and has 
a positive impact on fuel consumption.

History of diesel fuel injection

Bosch started development on a fuel-injection
system for diesel engines in 1922 The techno-
logical omens were good: Bosch had experi-
ence with internal-combustion engines, its
production systems were highly advanced
and, above all, expertise developed in the pro-
duction of lubrication pumps could be utilized.
Nevertheless, this step was still a substantial
risk for Bosch as there were many difficulties
to be overcome.

The first volume-production fuel-injection
pumps appeared in 1927. At the time, the level
of precision of the product was unmatched.
They were small, light, and enabled diesel
 engines to run at higher speeds. These in-line
fuel-injection pumps were used on commercial
vehicles from 1932 and in cars from 1936.
Since that time, the technological advance-
ment of the diesel engine and its fuel-injection
systems has continued unabated. 

In 1962, the distributor injection pump with
automatic timing device developed by Bosch
gave the diesel engine an additional boost.
More than two decades later, many years of
intensive development work at Bosch culmi-
nated in the arrival of the electronically con-
trolled diesel fuel-injection system. 

The pursuit of ever more precise metering
of minute volumes of fuel delivered at exactly
the right moment coupled with the aim of in-
creasing the injection pressure is a constant
challenge for developers. This has led to many
more innovations in the design of fuel-injection
systems (see figure).

In terms of fuel consumption and energy
 efficiency, the compression-ignition engine
 remains the benchmark. 

New fuel-injection systems have helped to
further exploit its potential. In addition, engine
performance has been continually improved
while noise and exhaust-gas emissions have
been consistently lowered.

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage 

Overview

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage

The function of the fuel supply system is 
to store and filter the required fuel, and to
provide the fuel-injection system with fuel 
at a specific supply pressure in all operating
conditions. For some applications, the fuel
return flow is also cooled.

Essentially, the fuel-supply system differs
greatly, depending on the fuel-injection
 system used, as the following figures for
 radial-piston pump, common-rail system and
passenger-car UIS show.

Overview

The fuel-supply system comprises the follow-
ing main components (Figs. 1, 2, 3):
(cid:0) Fuel tank
(cid:0) Pre-filter
(cid:0) Control unit cooler (optional)
(cid:0) Presupply pump (optional, also in-tank

pump on cars)

(cid:0) Fuel filter
(cid:0) Fuel pump (low-pressure)
(cid:0) Pressure-control valve (overflow valve)

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage 

Overview

79

Fuel tank
The fuel tank stores the fuel. It must be corro-
sion-resistant and leakproof at double the op-
erating pressure, but at least at 0.3 bar. Any
gauge pressure must be relieved automatically
by suitable vents or safety valves. When the
vehicle is negotiating corners,  inclines or
bumps, fuel must not escape past the filler
cap or leak out of the pressure- relief vents or
valves. 

The fuel tank must be separated from the

Diesel fuel filter
Fuel-injection equipment for diesel engines
are manufactured with great precision and
are sensitive to the slightest contamination 
in the fuel. The fuel filter has the following
functions:
(cid:0) Reduce particulate impurities to avoid 

particulate erosion

(cid:0) Separate emulgated water from free water

to avoid corrosion damage

engine to prevent the fuel from igniting in
case of an accident.

The fuel filter must be adapted to the fuel-
injection system.

Fuel-supply pump
The fuel-supply pump draws fuel from the
fuel tank and conveys it continuously to the
high-pressure pump. The fuel pump is inte-
grated in the high-pressure pump on axial-
piston and radial-piston distributor pumps,
and in a few instances in common-rail sys-
tems.

Alternatively, an additional fuel pump can

be provided as a presupply pump.

Fuel lines
Besides metallic tubes, flexible, flame-retar-
dant tubes reinforced with braided-steel
 armoring can be used in the low-pressure
stage. They must be routed so as to avoid
contact with moving components that might
damage them and in such a way that any leak
fuel or evaporation cannot collect or ignite.
The function of the fuel lines must not be im-
paired by twisting of the chassis, movement
of the engine or any other similar effects. 

All fuel-conveying parts must be protected

against heat that may affect their proper 
operation. On buses, fuel lines may not be
routed though the passenger cabin or the 
driver’s cab. Fuel may not be gravity-fed.

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage

Fuel filter

Fuel filter

Design and requirements
Modern direct-injection (DI) systems for
gasoline and diesel engines are highly sensi-
tive to the smallest impurities in the fuel.
Damage mainly occurs as a result of particu-
late erosion and water corrosion. The service-
life design of the fuel-injection system de-
pends on a specific minimum purity of the
fuel.

Particulate filtration
Reducing particulate impurities is one of 
the functions of the fuel filter. In this way, 
it protects the wear-prone components of 
the fuel-injection system. In other words, 
the fuel-injection system prescribes the neces-
sary filter fineness. Besides wear protection,
fuel filters must also have a sufficient particu-
late storage capacity, otherwise they could be-
come blocked before the end of the change
interval. If they do become blocked, they
would reduce fuel delivery quantity as well as
engine performance. It is therefore essential
to fit a fuel filter tailored to the  requirements
of the fuel-injection system.  Fitting the incor-
rect filters would have unpleasant results at
best; at worst, it would have very expensive
consequences (from replacing components
through to renewing the complete fuel-injec-
tion system).

Compared to gasoline fuel, diesel fuel con-
tains many more impurities. For this reason,
and also due to the much higher  injection
pressures, diesel fuel-injection  systems re-
quire greater wear protection, larger filtration
capacities, and longer service lives. As a result,
diesel filters are designed as exchange filters.

Requirements regarding filter fineness have

increased dramatically in the last few years
with the introduction of second-generation
common-rail systems and further advances in
Unit Injector Systems for  passenger cars and
commercial vehicles.  Depending on the appli-
cation (operating conditions, fuel contamina-
tion, engine life), new systems require filtra-
tion efficiencies ranging from 65% to 98.6%
(particle size 3 to 5 µm, ISO/TR 13353:1994).

Longer  servicing intervals in more recent 
vehicles require greater particulate storage 
capacities as well as intensive fine particulate
filtration.

Water separation
The second main function of diesel fuel  filters
is to separate emulgated and undissolved water
from the fuel in order to avoid corrosion dam-
age. Efficient water separation greater than
93% at maximum flow (ISO 4020:2001) is a
specially important  factor for distributor injec-
tion pumps and common-rail systems.

Designs
The filter must be carefully selected depend-
ing on the fuel-injection system and the oper-
ating conditions.

Main filter
The diesel fuel filter is normally fitted in the
low-pressure circuit between the electric fuel
pump and the high-pressure pump in the 
engine compartment.

The use of screw-on exchange filters, in-line
filters, and metalfree filter elements is wide-
spread. The replacement parts are inserted 
in filter housings made of aluminum, solid
plastic, or sheet steel (to meet higher crash
 requirements). Only the filter element is
 replaced in these filters. The filter elements
are mainly spiral vee-shaped (Fig. 1).

Two filters can also be fitted in parallel,
 resulting in greater particulate storage capac-
ity. Connecting the filter in series produces a
higher filtration efficiency. Stepped filters, or
a fine filter with a matched pre- filter, are used
in series connections.

Pre-filter for presupply pump
If requirements are particularly high, an addi-
tional pre-filter is fitted on the suction or
pressure side with a filter fineness matched 
to the main filter (fine filter). Pre-filters are
mainly used for commercial vehicles in coun-
tries that have poor diesel fuel quality. These
filters are mainly designed as strainers with a
mesh width of 300 µm.

2

Diesel fuel filter with water drain and 
water sensor

Water separator
Water is separated by the filter medium using
the repellent effect (droplets forming due to
the different surface tensions of water and
fuel). Separated water collects in the chamber
at the bottom of the filter housings (Fig. 2).
Conductivity sensors are used in some cases
to monitor the water level. The water is
drained manually by opening a  water drain
plug or pressing a pushbutton switch. Fully
automatic water-disposal systems are cur-
rently under development.

Filter media
Increased demands with respect to fuel filters
in engines of the new generation require the
use of special filter media composed of sev-
eral synthetic layers and cellulose. The filter
media employ a preliminary fine filtering 
effect and guarantee maximum particulate
retention capacity by separating particles
within each filtering layer.

The new filter generation is also deployable
with biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester
(FAME). However, the higher concentration
of organic particles in FAME means taking
account of a shorter filter service life in the
servicing concept.

Additional functions
Modern filter modules integrate additional
modular functions such as: 
(cid:0) Fuel preheating: Electrically, by cooling 
water, or by return fuel flow. Preheating
prevents paraffin crystals from blocking 
the filter pores in winter.

(cid:0) Displaying the servicing interval by
 measuring differential pressure.

(cid:0) Filling and venting facilities: After a filter

change, the fuel system is filled and vented
by hand pump. The pump is usually inte-
grated in the  filter cover.

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage

Fuel-supply pump 

Fuel-supply pump

The fuel-supply pump in the low-pressure
stage (the so-called presupply pump) is re-
sponsible for maintaining an adequate supply
of fuel to the high-pressure components. 
This applies:
(cid:0) irrespective of operating state,
(cid:0) with a minimum of noise,
(cid:0) at the necessary pressure, and
(cid:0) throughout the vehicle’s complete 

service life.

The fuel-supply pump draws fuel out of the
fuel tank and conveys it continuously in the 
required quantity (injected fuel quantity and
scavenging flow) to the high-pressure fuel-in-
jection installation (60...500 l/h, 300...700 kPa
or 3...7 bar). Many pumps bleed themselves

automatically so that starting is possible even
when the fuel tank has run dry.

There are three designs: 
(cid:0) Electric fuel pump (as used in passenger

(cid:0) Mechanically driven gear-type supply

cars)

pumps, and

(cid:0) Tandem fuel pumps (passenger cars, UIS)

In axial-piston and radial-piston distributor
pumps, a vane-type supply pump is used as
presupply pump and is integrated directly in
the fuel-injection pump.

Electric fuel pump
The Electric Fuel Pump (EFP, Figs. 1 and 2) 
is only fitted to passenger cars and light-duty
trucks. As part of the system-monitoring
strategy, it is responsible, besides fuel delivery,
for cutting off the fuel supply, if this is neces-
sary in an emergency.

Electric fuel pumps are available as in-line
or in-tank versions. In-line pumps are fitted 
to the vehicle’s body platform outside of the
fuel tank in the fuel line between tank and fuel
filter. On the other hand, in-tank pumps are
located inside of the fuel tank in a special re-
tainer that normally includes a suction-side
fuel strainer, a fuel-level sensor, a swirl plate
acting as fuel reservoir, and the electrical and
hydraulic connections to the exterior.

Starting with the engine cranking process,

the electric fuel pump runs continuously,
 irrespective of engine speed. This means that
it permanently delivers fuel from the fuel
tank through a fuel filter to the fuel- injection
system. Excess fuel flows back to the tank
through an overflow valve.

A safety circuit is provided to prevent 
the delivery of fuel if ignition is on and the
engine is stopped.

An electric fuel pump comprises three
function elements inside of a common hous-
ing:

Pump element (Fig. 1, A)
There are a variety of different pump-element
designs available, depending on the electric
fuel pump’s specific operating  concept. Diesel
applications mainly use Roller-Cell Pumps
(RCP). 

The roller-cell pump (Fig. 2) is a positive-
displacement pump consisting of an eccentri-
cally located base plate (4) in which a slotted
rotor (2) is free to rotate. There is a movable
roller in each slot (3) which, when the rotor
rotates, is forced outwards against the outside
roller path and against the driving flanks of
the slots by centrifugal force and the pressure
of the fuel. The result is that the rollers now
act as rotating seals, whereby a chamber is
formed between the rollers of adjacent slots
and the roller path. The pumping effect is due
to the fact that, once the kidney-shaped inlet
opening (1) has closed, the chamber volume
reduces continuously.

Electric motor (Fig. 1, B)
The electric motor comprises a permanent-
magnet system and an armature (2). Design is
determined by the required delivery quantity
at a given system pressure. The electric motor
is permanently flushed by fuel so that it re-
mains cool. This design permits high motor
performance without the necessity for com-
plicated sealing elements between pumping
element and electric motor.

End cover (Fig. 1, C)
The end cover contains the electrical

is incorporated to prevent the fuel lines from
emptying once the fuel pump has been
switched off. Interference suppressors can
also be fitted in the end cover.

Gear-type fuel pump
The gear-type supply pump (Figs. 4 and 6) is
used to supply the fuel-injection modules of
single-cylinder pump systems (commercial
vehicles) and common-rail systems (passen-
ger cars, commercial vehicles, and off-road
vehicles). It is directly attached to the engine
or is integrated in the common-rail high-
pressure pump. Common forms of drive 
are via coupling, gearwheel, or toothed belt.
The main components are two rotating,

engaged gearwheels that convey the fuel 
in the tooth gaps from the suction side 
(Fig. 6, 1) to the pressure side (5). The line 
of contact between the rotating gearwheels
provides the seal between the suction and
pressure sides of the pump, and prevents 
fuel from flowing back again.

The delivery quantity is approximately pro-

portional to engine speed, For this reason,
fuel-delivery control takes place either by
throttle control on the suction side, or by
means of an overflow valve on the pressure
side (Fig. 5).

The gear-type fuel pump is maintenance-free.
In order to bleed the fuel system before the
first start, or when the tank has run dry, a

Fuel-supply pump

Vane-type pump with separating vanes
In the version of this pump used with the
passenger-car UIS (Fig. 7), two separating
vanes (4) are pressed by springs (3) against 
a rotor (1). When the rotor rotates, volume
increases at the inlet (suction) end (2) and
fuel is drawn into two chambers. With con-
tinued rotation, chamber volumes decrease,
and fuel is forced out of the chambers at the
outlet (pressure) end (5). This pump delivers
fuel even at very low rotational speeds.

Tandem pump
The tandem pump used on the passenger-
car UIS is a unit comprising the fuel pump
(Fig. 8) and the vacuum pump for the brake
booster. It is attached to the engine’s cylinder
head and driven by the engine’s cam shaft.
The fuel pump itself is either a vane-type
pump with separating vanes or a gear pump
(3), and even at low speeds (cranking speeds)
delivers enough fuel to ensure that the engine
starts reliably. The pump contains a variety of
valves and throttling  orifices:

Suction throttling orifice (6): Essentially, 
the quantity of fuel delivered by the pump 
is proportional to the pump’s speed. The
pump’s maximum delivery quantity is limited
by the suction throttling orifice so that not
too much fuel is delivered.

Overpressure valve (7): This is used to limit
the maximum pressure in the high-pressure
stage. 

Throttling bore (4): Vapor bubbles in the 
fuel-pump outlet are eliminated in the 
fuel-return throttling bore (1). 

Bypass (12): If there is air in the fuel system
(for instance, if the vehicle has been driven
until the fuel tank is empty), the low-pressure
pressure-control valve remains closed. The air
is forced out of the fuel system through the
bypass by the pressure of the pumped fuel.

Thanks to the ingenious routing of the pump
passages, the pump’s gearwheels never run
dry even when the fuel tank is empty. When
restarting after filling the tank, therefore, this
means that the pump draws in fuel immedi-
ately. 

The fuel pump is provided with a connec-
tion (8) for measuring the fuel pressure in the
pump outlet.

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage

Miscellaneous components

Miscellaneous components

Distributor tube
The passenger-car UIS is provided with a dis-
tributor tube which, as its name implies, dis-
tributes the fuel to the unit injectors. This
form of distribution ensures that the individ-
ual injectors all receive the same quantities of
fuel at the same temperature, and smooth en-
gine running is the result. In the distributor
tube, fuel flowing to the unit injectors mixes
with fuel flowing back from them in order to
even out the temperature.

Low-pressure pressure-control valve
The pressure-control valve (Fig. 1) is an over-
flow valve installed in the fuel return of the
UIS and UPS systems. Independent of operat-
ing status, it provides for adequate operating
pressure in the respective low-pressure stages
so that the pumps are always well filled with a

consistently even charge of fuel. The accumu-
lator plunger (5) opens at a “snap-open pres-
sure” of 3...3.5 bar, so that the conical seat (7)
releases the accumulator volume (6). Only
very little leakage fuel can escape through the
gap seal (4). The spring (3) is compressed as a
function of the fuel pressure, so that the accu-
mulator volume changes and compensates for
minor pressure fluctuations. 

When pressure has increased to 4...4.5 bar,
the gap seal also opens and the flow quantity
increases abruptly. The valve closes again
when the pressure drops. Two threaded ele-
ments (2), each with a different spring seat,
are available for preliminary adjustment of
opening pressure. 

ECU cooler
On commercial vehicles, ECU cooling must
be provided if the ECU for the UIS or UPS
systems is mounted directly on the engine. 
In such cases, fuel is used as the cooling
medium. It flows past the ECU in special
cooling channels and in the process absorbs
heat from the electronics.

Fuel cooler
Due to the high pressures in the injectors for
the passenger-car UIS, and some Common
Rail Systems (CRS), the fuel heats up to such
an extent that in order to prevent damage to
fuel tank and level sensor it must be cooled
down before returning. The fuel returning
from the injector flows through the fuel
cooler (heat exchanger, Fig. 2, 3) and gives off
heat energy to the coolant in the fuel-cooling
circuit. This is separated from the engine-
cooling circuit (6) since at normal engine
temperatures the engine coolant is too hot to
absorb heat from the fuel. In order that the
fuel-cooling circuit can be filled and tempera-
ture fluctuations compensated for, the fuel-
cooling circuit is connected to the engine-
cooling circuit near the equalizing reservoir
(5). Connection is such that the fuel-cooling
circuit is not adversely affected by the engine-
cooling circuit which is at a higher tempera-
ture.

Diesel aircraft engines of the 1920s and 30s

In the 1920s and 1930s numerous two and
four-stroke diesel engines were developed for
use as aircraft engines. Apart from their eco-
nomical consumption and the lower price of
diesel fuel, diesels had a number of other fea-
tures in their favor such as a lower fire risk and
simpler maintenance due to the absence of
carburetor, spark plugs and magneto. Engi-
neers also hoped that the compression-igni-
tion engine would provide good performance
at high altitudes. In those days, spark-ignition
engines were liable to misfire because the
 ignition system was subject to atmospheric
pressure. The main problems associated with
the development of a diesel aircraft engine
 involved controlling the fuel/air mixture effec-
tively and handling the higher mechanical and
thermal stresses.

The most successful production aircraft diesel
engine was the Jumo 205 6-cylinder two-stroke
opposed-piston heavy-oil engine (see illustra-
tion). Following its introduction in 1933 it was
fitted in numerous planes. It had a take-off
power output of up to 645kW (880hp). 
Its strengths primarily lay in its suitability for
long-distance flights at constant speeds, 
e.g. for transatlantic postal services. 
Around 900 units of this reliable engine
were built.

The fuel injection
system for the
Jumo 205 con-
sisted of two pumps and two
 injectors for each cylinder. The
 injection pressure was in excess 
of 500 bar. It was that fuel-injection
system which was a major factor in
the breakthrough of the Jumo 205.
Based on the experience gained
from that engine, development work
was also started on direct fuel-injec-
tion for spark-ignition aircraft engines
in the 1930s.

The Jumo 205 was followed in 1939 by the
Jumo 207 high-altitude engine which also had
a take-off power output of 645 kW (880 hp).
Thanks to its turbocharger aspiration, aircraft
with the new engine could reach altitudes of
up to 14,000 metres.

The technical high point in the development 
of diesel aircraft engines was the experimental
24-cylinder opposed-piston Jumo 224 pro-
duced in the early 1940s which developed as
much as 3,330 kW (4,400 hp) take-off power.
This “square configuration” engine had its
cylinders arranged in a cross formation driving
four separate crankshafts.

A whole series of diesel aircraft engines were
developed by other manufacturers as well.
However, none of them progressed beyond
the experimental stage. In later years interest
in diesel aircraft engines waned because of
progress made with high-performance spark-
ignition engines with fuel injection.

Fuel supply system to the low-pressure stage

Supplementary valves for in-line fuel-injection pumps

Supplementary valves for   
in-line fuel-injection pumps

In addition to the overflow valve, electronically
controlled in-line fuel-injection pumps also
have an electric shutoff valve (Type ELAB) 
or an electrohydraulic shutoff device (Type
EHAB).

Overflow valve
The overflow valve is fitted to the pump’s
fuel-return outlet. It opens at a pressure 
(2...3 bar) that is set to suit the fuel-injection
pump concerned and thereby maintains the
pressure in the fuel gallery at a constant level
A valve spring (Fig. 1, 4) acts on a spring seat
(2) which presses the valve cone (5) against
the valve seat (6). As the pressure, pi in the
fuel-injection pump rises, it pushes the valve
seat back, thus opening the valve. When the
pressure drops, the valve closes again. The
valve seat has to travel a certain distance be-
fore the valve is fully open. The buffer volume
thus created evens out rapid pressure varia-
tions, which has a positive  effect on valve 
service life.

Type ELAB electric shutoff valve
The Type ELAB electric shutoff valve acts as a
redundant(i.e.duplicate)back-upsafetydevice.
It is a 2/2-way solenoid valve which is screwed
into the fuel inlet of the in-line fuel-injection
pump (Fig. 2). When not energized, it cuts off
the fuel supply to the pump’s fuel gallery. Asa
result,thefuel-injectionpumpisprevented from
delivering fuel to the nozzles even if the actua-
tormechanismisdefective,andtheengine can-
not overrev. The engine control unit closes the
electricshutoff valveif itdetectsapermanent
governor deviation or if a fault in the control
unit’s fuel-quantity controller is detected.

When it is energized (i.e. when the status of
Terminal 15 is “Ignition on”), the electromag-
net (Fig. 2, 3) draws in the solenoid  armature
(4) (12 or 24 V, stroke approx. 1.1 mm). The
sealing cone seal (7) attached to the armature
then opens the channel to the inlet passage (9).
When the engine is switched off using the
starter switch (“ignition switch”), the supply of
electricity to the solenoid coil is also discon-
nected. This causes the magnetic field to col-
lapse so that the compression spring (5) pushes
the armature and the attached sealing cone
back against the valve seat.

Type EHAB electrohydraulic shutoff  device
The Type EHAB electrohydraulic shutoff de-
vice is used as a safety shutoff for fuel-injec-
tion pumps with relatively high fuel gallery
pressures. In such cases, the capabilities of the
Type ELAB electric shutoff valve are insuffi-
cient. With high fuel-gallery pressures and in
the absence of any special compensating de-
vices, it can take up to 10 s for the pressure to
drop sufficiently for fuel injection to stop.
The electrohydraulic shutoff device thus en-
sures that fuel is drawn back out of the fuel-
injection pump by the presupply pump.
Thus, when the valve is de- energized, the fuel
gallery pressure in the fuel-injection pump is
dissipated much more quickly and the engine
can be stopped within a period of no more
than 2 s. The electrohydraulic shutoff device
is mounted directly on the fuel-injection
pump. The EHAB housing also incorporates
an integrated fuel-temperature sensor for the
 electronic governing system (Fig. 3, 8).

Normal operation setting (Fig. 3a)
As soon as the engine control unit activates
the electrohydraulic shutoff device (“Ignition
on”), the electromagnet (6) draws in the sole-
noid armature (5, operating voltage 12 V).
Fuel can then flow from the fuel tank (10) via
the heat exchanger (11) for cold starting and
the preliminary filter (3) to port A. From there,
the fuel passes through the right-hand valve
past the solenoid armature to port B. This is
connected to the presupply pump (1) which
pumps the fuel via the main fuel filter (2) to
port C of the electrohydraulic shutoff device.
The fuel then passes through the open left-
hand valve to port D and finally from there 
to the fuel-injection pump (12).

Reversed-flow setting (Fig. 3b)
When the ignition is switched off, the valve
spring (7) presses the solenoid armature back
to its resting position. The intake side of the
presupply pump is then connected directly to
the fuel-injection pump’s inlet passage so that
fuel flows back from the fuel gallery to the
fuel tank. The right hand valve opens the con-
nection between the preliminary filter and

pumps

Overview of discrete cylinder systems

Diesel engines with discrete cylinder 
systems have a separate fuel-injection 
pump for each cylinder of the engine. Such 
individual fuel-injection pumps are eas-
ily adaptable to particular engines. The 
short high-pressure fuel lines enable the 
achievement of particularly good injec-
tion characteristics and extremely high 
injection pressures.

Continually increasing demands have led to 
the development of a variety of diesel fuel-
injection systems, each of which is suited to 
different requirements. 

Modern diesel engines must offer low 
emissions, good fuel economy, high torque 
and power output while also being quiet-
running.

There are basically three types of discrete 
cylinder systems: type PF helix-controlled 
discrete injection pumps, solenoid-valve-
controlled unit injector and unit pump sys-
tems. These systems differ not only in their 
design but also in their performance data 
and areas of application (Fig. 1).

Type PF discrete 
 injection pumps

Applications
Type PF discrete injection pumps are par-
ticularly easy to maintain. They are used in 
the “off-highway” sector as
   fuel-injection pumps for diesel engines 
with outputs of 4…75 kW/cylinder in 
small construction machines, pumps, 
tractors and power generators, and
   fuel-injection pumps for large-scale en-

gines with outputs of between 75 kW and 
1,000 kW per cylinder. These versions 
are capable of working with high-viscos-
ity diesel fuel and heavy oil.

Design and method of operation
Type PF discrete injection pumps operate 
in the same way as type PE in-line fuel-in-
jection pumps. They have a single pump 
unit on which the injected fuel quantity can 
be varied by means of a helix.

Each discrete injection pump is sepa-
rately flange-mounted to the engine and 
driven by the camshaft that controls the 
engine valve timing. They can therefore

be described as externally driven pumps 
(PF: German designation for an externally 
driven pump). They may also be referred to 
as plug-in pumps.

Some of the smaller type PF pumps come in 
2-, 3- and 4-cylinder versions. However, the 
majority of designs supply only a single cyl-
inder and are therefore known as discrete 
or single-cylinder injection pumps.

Closed-loop control
As with in-line fuel-injection pumps, a 
control rack incorporated in the engine 
engages with the pump plunger-and-bar-
rel assembly. A governor or control system 
moves the control rack, thereby varying the 
fuel delivery and injected fuel quantity.
On large-scale engines, the governor 
is mounted directly on the engine block. 
Hydro-mechanical governors or electronic 
control systems may be used, or more 
rarely, purely mechanical governors.

Between the control rack for the discrete 

injection pumps and the actuating linkage 
from the governor, type PF pumps have a 
sprung compensating link so that, in the 

2 PF 45 in common-rail system

event that the adjusting mechanism on 
one of the pumps jams, control of the other 
pumps is not compromised.

Fuel supply
The fuel is fed to the discrete injection 
pumps by a gear-type presupply pump. It 
delivers around 3...5 times as much fuel as 
the maximum full-load delivery of all the 
fuel-injection pumps. The fuel pressure in 
this part of the system is around 3...10 bar.

The fuel is filtered by fine filters with a pore 
size of 5...30 µm in order to keep suspended 
particles out of the fuel-injection system. 
Such particles would otherwise cause pre-
mature wear on the part of the high-preci-
sion fuel-injection components.

Use in common-rail system
Discrete injection pumps are used and 
further developed as high-pressure pumps 
in 2nd and 3rd generation common-rail 
systems for truck and off-highway applica-
tions. Fig. 2 shows the use of the PF 45 in 
a common-rail system for a six-cylinder 
engine.

  Overview of discrete cylinder systems   Unit injector system (UIS) and unit pump system (UPS)

Unit injector system (UIS) 
and unit pump system (UPS)

The unit injector and unit pump fuel-injec-
tion systems achieve the highest injection 
pressures of all diesel fuel-injection systems 
currently available. They are capable of 
high-precision fuel injection that is infinitely 
variable in response to the engine operating 
state. Diesel engines equipped with these 
systems produce low emission levels, are 
economical and quiet to run, and offer high 
performance and torque characteristics.

Areas of application
Unit injector system (UIS)
The unit injector system (UIS) went into 
volume production for commercial vehicles 
in 1994 and for cars in 1998. It is a fuel-injec-
tion system with timer-controlled discrete 
injection pumps for diesel engines with 
direct injection (DI). This system offers a sig-
nificantly greater degree of adaptability to 
individual engine designs than conventional 
helix-controlled systems. It can be used on a 
wide range of modern diesel engines for cars 
and commercial vehicles extending to 
   cars and light-duty commercial vehicles 
with power plants ranging from three-
cylinder engines with a displacement of 
1.2 l developing 45 kW (61 bhp) of power 
and 195 Nm of torque to ten-cylinder 
engines with a displacement of 5 l devel-
oping 230 kW (312 bhp) of power and 
750 Nm of torque.

   heavy-duty commercial vehicles develop-

ing up to 80 kW/cylinder.

As it requires no high-pressure fuel lines, 
the unit injector system has excellent hy-
draulic characteristics. That is the reason 
why this system is capable of producing 
the highest injection pressures (up to 
2,200 bar). Hydro-mechanical pre-injection 
is effected in the unit injector system for 
passenger cars. The unit injector system for 
commercial vehicles offers the possibility 
of pre-injection in the lower engine-speed 
and load range. 

Unit pump system (UPS)
The unit pump system (UPS) is also referred 
to by the type designation PF..MV for large-
scale engines.

Like the unit injector system, the unit pump 
system is a fuel-injection system with timer-
controlled discrete injection pumps for 
direct-injection (DI) diesel engines. The 
 following versions may be used:
   UPS 12 for commercial-vehicle engines 

with up to 6 cylinders and 37 kW/cylinder

   UPS 20 for heavy-duty commercial- 

vehicle engines with up to 8 cylinders and 
65 kW/cylinder

   SP (plug-in pump, German: Steckpumpe) 

for heavy-duty commercial-vehicle 
engines with up to 18 cylinders and 
92 kW/cylinder

   SPS (plug-in pump – small) for commer-
cial-vehicle engines with up to 6 cylin-
ders and 40 kW/cylinder

   UPS for engines in construction and agri-
cultural machinery, railway locomotives 
and ships with power outputs of up to 
500 kW/cylinder and up to 20 cylinders

Design
System areas
The unit injector and unit pump systems are 
made up of four system areas (Fig. 3):
   Electronic Diesel Control (EDC), consist-
ing of the system blocks of sensors, ECU 
and actuators, performs all diesel-engine 
management and control functions as 
well as providing all electrical and elec-
tronic interfaces.

   The fuel-supply system (low-pressure 
stage) provides suitably filtered fuel at 
the correct pressure.

   The high-pressure stage generates the 

necessary injection pressure and injects 
the fuel into the combustion chamber.
   The air-intake and exhaust-gas systems 
handle the supply of air for combustion, 
exhaust-gas recirculation and exhaust-
gas treatment.

     93

Differences
The essential difference between the unit 
injector system and the unit pump system 
lies in the engine layout (Fig. 4).

In the unit injector system, the high-

 pressure pump and the nozzle form a single 
unit – the “unit injector”. There is a unit 
injector fitted in each cylinder of the engine. 
As there are no high-pressure fuel lines, 
extremely high injection pressures can be 

generated and precisely controlled injec-
tion patterns can be produced.

With the unit pump system, the high-pres-
sure pump – the “unit pump” – and the 
nozzle-holder assembly are separate units 
that are connected by a short length of high-
pressure line. This arrangement has advan-
tages in terms of use of space, pump-drive 
system, and servicing and maintenance.

  Unit injector system

  Installation and drive

Unit injector system (UIS)

In the unit injector system (UIS), the fuel-
injection pump, high-pressure solenoid 
valve and injection nozzle form a single 
unit. The compact construction – with 
very short high-pressure lines integrated 
in the component between pump and 
 nozzle – makes it easier to deliver higher 
injection pressures compared with other 
fuel-injection systems because the com-
pression volume 1)  and thus the compres-
sion losses are lower. The peak pressure in 
the UIS currently varies, depending on the 
type of pump, between 1,800 and 2,200 bar. 

Installation and drive

Each cylinder has its own unit injector (UI), 
which is installed directly in the cylinder 
head (Fig. 1). For passenger cars, there are 
two types of unit injector (UI-1, UI-2), which – 
while having an identical function – differ in 
size. In a 2-valve engine, the UI-1 is secured

using a clamping block at an angle of ap-
prox. 20° in the engine's cylinder head. In a 
4-valve engine, the smaller injector (UI-2) 
is used on account of the smaller amount of 
space available; this injector is secured ver-
tically in the cylinder head with anti-fatigue 
bolts.

The engine camshaft (2) has an actuating 
cam for each unit injector, the particular 
cam lift being transferred to the pump 
plunger (6) by a rocker arm (1). The injec-
tion curve is influenced by the shape of the 
actuating cams. These are shaped so that 
the pump plunger moves more slowly when 
fuel is taken in (upward movement) than 
during injection (downward movement) in 
order, on the one hand, to prevent air from 
being accidentally drawn in and, on the 
other hand, to achieve a high delivery rate.
Torsional vibration is induced in the cam-
shaft by the forces applied to it during 
operation, and adversely affects injection

characteristics and injected-fuel-quantity 
metering. It is therefore imperative that in 
order to reduce these vibrations the indi-
vidual-pump drives are designed to be as 
rigid as possible (this applies to the cam-
shaft drive, the camshaft itself, the rocker 
arm, and the rocker-arm bearings).

The unit injector is installed in the en-

gine’s cylinder head and is therefore subject 
to very high temperatures. It is cooled by 
relatively cool fuel flowing back to the low-
pressure stage.

Design

Fuel is supplied to the UI for passenger cars 
through roughly 500 laser-drilled inlet pas-
sages in the steel sleeve of the injector. The 
fuel is filtered by the passages, which have a 
diameter of less than 0.1 mm.

The unit-injector body assembly serves 

as the pump barrel. The nozzle (Fig. 2, 

item 7) is integrated in the stem of the unit 
injector. The stem and body assembly are 
connected to each other by means of a 
 retaining nut (13).

The return spring (1) forces the pump 
plunger against the rocker arm (8) and the 
rocker arm against the actuating cam (9). 
This ensures that pump plunger, rocker arm 
and cam are always in contact during actual 
operation.

In the unit injector for commercial vehicles, 
the solenoid valve is integrated in the injec-
tor. In the UI for passenger cars, however, 
it is mounted externally on the pump body 
on account of the injector's smaller dimen-
sions.

The design of the injector for passenger 
cars and commercial vehicles is shown on 
the following pages.

  Unit injector system

  Method of operation of UI for

 

passenger cars

Method of operation of UI 
for passenger cars

Pre-injection
Hydro-mechanically controlled pre-injec-
tion is effected in the unit injector for pas-
senger cars by an accumulator plunger and 
a damping unit.

this phase, the nozzle-needle lift is hydrau-
lically limited by a damping unit (see sec-
tion entitled “Nozzle-needle damping”). 
The accumulator plunger (6) initially 

remains on its seat because the nozzle 
needle opens first on account of its greater, 
hydraulically effective surface on which the 
pressure acts. 

Induction stroke (Fig. 5a)
The pump plunger (4) is forced upwards by 
the return spring when the actuating cam 
(3) rotates. The fuel, which is permanently 
under pressure, flows from the fuel-supply 
system's low-pressure stage through the 
inlet passage (1) into the injector. The sole-
noid valve is open. The fuel passes through 
the opened solenoid-valve seat (11) into the 
high-pressure chamber (5).

Prestroke (Fig. 5b)
The actuating cam continues to rotate and 
forces the pump plunger downwards. The 
solenoid valve is open, and the fuel is forced 
back by the pump plunger into the fuel-sup-
ply system's low-pressure stage (2). Heat 
is also dissipated from the injector with 
the fuel as it flows back, i.e. the injector is 
cooled. 

Delivery stroke and injection 
At a given instant in time, the ECU energizes 
the solenoid coil so that the solenoid-valve 
needle is pressed into the solenoid-valve 
seat (11), and the connection between the 
high-pressure chamber and the low-pres-
sure stage is closed. This instant is called 
the Beginning of Injection Period (BIP); how-
ever, it corresponds not to the actual start of 
injection but to the start of delivery. 

Start of pre-injection (Fig. 5c)
Further volume displacement of the pump 
plunger causes the fuel pressure in the 
high-pressure chamber to increase. The 
nozzle-opening pressure is approx. 180 bar 
for pre-injection. When this pressure is 
reached, the nozzle needle (9) lifts from its 
seat and pre-injection commences. During 

End of pre-injection (Fig. 5d)
Further pressure increase causes the accu-
mulator plunger to be forced downwards 
and then lifted off its seat so that a connec-
tion is set up between the high-pressure 
chamber (5) and the accumulator chamber 
(7). The resulting pressure drop in the 
high-pressure chamber, the pressure in-
crease in the accumulator chamber, and 
the simultaneous increase in the initial ten-
sion of the compression spring (8) cause 
the nozzle needle to close. This marks the 
end of pre-injection. In contrast to the noz-
zle needle, the accumulator plunger does 
not return to its starting position, because 
when open it presents to the fuel pressure 
a greater working surface than the nozzle 
needle. 

For the most part, the pre-injection quan-
tity of approx. 1.5 mm3 is determined by the 
opening pressure and lift of the accumula-
tor plunger. 

Main injection
Main injection requires a higher opening 
pressure at the nozzle than pre-injection. 
This has two causes: On the one hand, the 
excursion of the accumulator plunger 
increases the initial tension of the nozzle 
spring during pre-injection. On the other 
hand, the excursion of the accumulator 
must force fuel out of the spring-retainer 
chamber through a throttling orifice into 
the low-pressure stage of the fuel-supply 
system such that the fuel in the spring-re-
tainer chamber is subject to greater com-
pression (pressure backing). The pressure-
backing level is derived from the size of the 
throttling orifice in the spring retainer and

can thus be varied (small throttling orifice 
– large pressure increase – large difference 
in nozzle-opening pressure for pre- and 
main injection). In this way, it is possible to 
achieve a sensible compromise between a 
low opening pressure for pre-injection (for 
noise reasons) and as high an opening pres-
sure as possible for main injection espe-
cially at part load (emission-reducing). 

The time interval between pre- and main 
injection is chiefly determined by the ac-
cumulator-plunger lift (which for its part 
is determined by the initial tension of the 
compression spring) and the engine speed. 
It is approx. 0.2 - 0.6 ms. 

Continuation of delivery stroke (Fig. 6a)
Start of main injection
The continuing movement of the pump 
plunger leads to the pressure in the high-
pressure chamber continuing to increase. 
Upon reaching the nozzle-opening pres-
sure of now approx. 300 bar, the nozzle nee-
dle is lifted from its seat and fuel is sprayed 
into the engine's combustion chamber 

(actual start of injection). Due to the pump 
plunger's high delivery rate, the pressure 
continues to increase throughout the whole 
of the injection process. The maximum 
pressure is reached during the transitional 
phase between delivery stroke and residual 
stroke (see below). 

End of main injection
To terminate main injection, the solenoid 
coil deactivates the current flow; the so-
lenoid valve opens after a short delay and 
opens the connection between the high-
pressure chamber and the low-pressure 
stage. The pressure collapses, and when it 
drops below the nozzle-closing pressure, 
the nozzle closes and terminates the injec-
tion process. The accumulator plunger then 
returns to its starting position.

Residual stroke (Fig. 6b)
The residual fuel is returned to the low-
pressure stage during the downward 
 movement of the pump plunger. Heat is 
again dissipated from the injector in this 
process.

now forms a hydraulic cushion (Fig. 8, 
item 2) because it can only be forced into the 
nozzle-spring chamber through a narrow 
leakage gap (1). Further upward movement 
of the nozzle needle is thus limited.

The effect of nozzle-needle damping is neg-
ligible during main injection because much 
greater opening forces act on the nozzle 
needle on account of the higher pressure 
level.

Intrinsic safety
Individual-pump systems are intrinsically 
safe since, in the event of a fault, one uncon-
trolled injection is the maximum that can 
occur:

   If the solenoid valve remains open, no in-
jection can take place since the fuel flows 
back into the low-pressure stage and it is 
impossible for pressure to be built up.
   When the solenoid valve is permanently 
closed, no fuel can enter the high-pres-
sure chamber since the chamber can only 
be filled via the opened solenoid-valve 
seat. In this case, at the most only a single 
injection can take place.

Method of operation of UI 
for commercial vehicles

In terms of main injection, the unit injector 
system for commercial vehicles (Fig. 9) es-
sentially functions in the same way as the 
system for passenger cars. There are differ-
ences with regard to pre-injection: the unit 
injector system for commercial vehicles 
offers the possibility in the lower engine-
speed and load range of electronically con-
trolled pre-injection, which is effected by 
actuating the solenoid valve twice. 

Nozzle-needle damping
During pre-injection, the nozzle-needle 
lift is hydraulically limited by a damping 
unit so that the small injected fuel quantity 
required can be metered precisely (see sec-
tion entitled “Pre-injection”). For this pur-
pose, the needle lift is limited to roughly one 
third of the overall stroke for main injection. 
The damping unit is formed by a damping 

plunger which is situated above the nozzle 
needle (Fig. 7, item 4). The nozzle needle 
opens initially undamped until the damping 
plunger (4) reaches the bore of the damping 
plate (3). The fuel above the nozzle needle

High-pressure solenoid valve

  

     107

High-pressure solenoid valve

The high-pressure solenoid valve controls 
pressure buildup, start of injection and in-
jection duration.

Design
Valve
The valve itself comprises the valve needle 
(Fig. 10, item 2), valve body (12) and valve 
spring (1).

The valve body’s sealing surface is coni-

cally ground (10), and the valve needle is 
also provided with a conical sealing surface 
(11). The angle of the needle's ground sur-
face is slightly larger than that of the valve 
body. With the valve closed, when the nee-
dle is forced up against the valve body, valve 
body and needle are only in contact along 
a line (and not a surface) which represents 
the valve seat. As a result of this dual-coni-
cal sealing arrangement, sealing is very ef-
ficient. High-precision machining must be 
applied to match the valve needle and valve 
body perfectly to each other.

Magnet
The magnet consists of the magnet yoke 
and the movable armature (16). The magnet 

yoke itself comprises the magnet core (15), 
a coil (6), and the electrical contacting with 
plug (8).

The armature is secured or non-posi-
tively connected to the valve needle. In the 
non-energized position, there is an initial or 
residual air gap between the magnet yoke 
and the armature.

Method of operation
Valve open
The solenoid valve is open as long as it is 
not actuated, i.e. when no current is ap-
plied across its coil. The force exerted by 
the valve spring pushes the valve needle up 
against the stop so that the valve through-
flow cross-section (9) between the valve 
needle and the valve body is opened in the 
vicinity of the valve seat. The pump’s high-
pressure (3) and low-pressure (4) areas 
are now connected with each other. In this 
initial position, it is possible for fuel to flow 
into and out of the high-pressure chamber.

Valve closed
The ECU actuates the coil when an injection 
of fuel is to take place. The pickup current 
causes a magnetic flux in the magnetic-cir-
cuit components (magnet core, magnet disk

and armature). This magnetic flux gener-
ates a magnetic force which pulls in the 
armature towards the magnet disk (14) and 
with it moves the valve needle towards the 
valve body. The armature is pulled in until 
the valve needle and valve body come into 
contact at the seal seat and the valve closes. 
A residual air gap remains between the ar-
mature and the magnet disk.

The magnetic force is not only used to 
pull in the armature, but must at the same 
time overcome the force exerted by the 
valve spring and hold the armature against 
the spring force. In addition, the magnetic 
force must keep the sealing surfaces in con-
tact with each other with a certain force in 
order also to withstand the pressure from 
the element chamber.

When the solenoid valve is closed, pres-
sure is built up in the high-pressure chamber 
during the downward movement of the pump 
plunger to facilitate fuel injection. To stop the 
fuel-injection process, the current through 
the solenoid coil is switched off. As a result, 
the magnetic flux and the magnetic force col-
lapse, and the spring forces the valve needle 
to its normal position against the stop. The 
valve seat is opened and the pressure in the 
high-pressure chamber is reduced.

11 Activation sequence of high-pressure solenoid valve

Activation
In order for the high-pressure solenoid 
valve to close, it is activated with a rela-
tively high pickup current (Fig. 11, a) with 
a steeply rising edge. This ensures short 
switching times for the solenoid valve and 
exact metering of the injected fuel quantity. 
When the valve is closed, the pickup cur-

rent can be reduced to a holding current 
(c) in order to keep the valve closed. This 
reduces the heat loss due to current flow. 
The holding current required is smaller, the 
nearer the armature is to the magnet disk 
because a small gap causes a greater mag-
netic force.

For a brief period between the pickup-
current and holding-current phases, con-
stant triggering current is applied to permit 
the detection of the solenoid-valve closing 
point (“BIP detection”, phase b).

In order to ensure high-speed, defined 
opening of the solenoid valve at the end of 
the injection event, a high voltage is applied 
across the terminals for rapid quenching 
of the energy stored in the solenoid valve 
(phase d).

History of diesel fuel injection

 History of diesel fuel injection

Meilensteine (cid:23)
 Milestones in diesel fuel injection
der Dieseleinspritztechnik.

Development by Bosch of a fuel-injection 

system for diesel engines started in 1922. 

The technological omens were good: Bosch 

had experience with internal-combustion 

 engines, its production systems were highly 

advanced and, above all, expertise devel-

oped in the production of lubrication pumps 

could be utilized. Nevertheless, this step 

was still a substantial risk for Bosch as there 

were still many difficulties to be overcome.

 

The first volume-production fuel-injec-

tion pumps appeared in 1927. At the time, 

the level of precision of the product was 

unmatched. They were small, light, and en-

abled diesel engines to run at higher speeds. 

These in-line fuel-injection pumps were used 

on commercial vehicles from 1932 and in 

cars from 1936. Since that time, the tech-

nological advancement of the diesel engine 

and its fuel-injection systems has continued 

 unabated. 

 

In 1962 the distributor-type injection 

pump with automatic timing device devel-

oped by Bosch gave the diesel engine an ad-

ditional boost. More than two decades later,

many years of intensive development work 

at Bosch culminated in the arrival of the

electronically controlled diesel fuel-injection 

system. 

 

The pursuit of ever more precise meter-

ing of minute volumes of fuel delivered at 

exactly the right moment coupled with the 

aim of increasing the injection pressure is a 

constant challenge for developers. This has 

led to many more innovations in the design 

of fuel-injection systems (see graphic).

 

In terms of fuel consumption and energy 

efficiency, the compression-ignition engine 

remains the benchmark. 

  New fuel-injection systems have helped 

to further exploit its potential. In addition, 

engine performance has been continually 

improved while noise and exhaust-gas emis-

sions have been consistently lowered.

  Unit pump system

  InstalIation and drive, design

Unit pump system (UPS)

The unit pump system (UPS) is used in 
commercial vehicles and large engines. 
The unit pump (UP) works in the same way 
as the unit injector (UI) for commercial 
 vehicles. In contrast to the UI, however, 
the nozzle and the injector are kept sepa-
rate in the UP and connected to each other 
by a short line. 

Design

   New cylinder-head design is unnecessary
   Rigid drive, since no rocker arms are 

needed

   Simple handling for workshop staff since 

the pumps are easy to remove

InstalIation and drive

The nozzle in the unit pump system is 
 installed with a nozzle-holder assembly 
in the cylinder head whereas in the unit 
 injector system it is integrated directly in 
the injector. 

The pump is secured to the side of the 
 engine block (Fig. 1) and driven directly by 
an injection cam (Fig. 2, item 13) on the en-
gine camshaft via a roller tappet (26). This 
offers the following advantages over the UI:

In contrast to the unit injector, high-pres-
sure lines are installed in the unit pump 
between the high-pressure pump and the 
nozzle. These lines must be able to perma-
nently withstand the maximum pump pres-
sure and the to some extent high-frequency 
pressure fluctuations which occur during 
the injection pauses. High-tensile, seamless 
steel tubes are therefore used. The lines 
are kept as short as possible and must be of 
identical length for the individual pumps of 
an engine.

The way in which the solenoid valve works 
described in relation to the unit injector re-
sults in a triangular injection curve. In some 
unit pump systems, a design modification of 
the solenoid valve is used to produce a boot-
shaped injection curve. For this purpose, 
the solenoid valve is equipped with a mov-
ing lift-stop (Fig. 4, item 1), which is used 
to limit intermediate lift and thereby facili-
tates a throttled switching state (“boot”).
After the solenoid valve closes, the 
solenoid-valve current is returned to an 
intermediate level (Fig. 3, phase c1) below 
the holding current (c2) so that the valve 
needle rests on the lift-stop. This enables a 
throttling gap, which limits further pressure 
buildup. By raising the current, the valve is 
fully closed again and the “boot” phase is 
terminated.

This procedure is known as Current-

 Controlled Rate Shaping (CCRS).

Dimensions of diesel fuel-injection technology  

  113

 Dimensions of diesel fuel-injection technology

The world of diesel fuel injection is a world 
of superlatives.
  The valve needle of a commercial-vehicle 
nozzle will open and close the nozzle more 
than a billion times in the course of its 
service life. It provides a reliable seal at 
pressures as high as 2,200 bar and has to 
withstand many other stresses such as
  the shocks caused by rapid opening and 
closing (on cars this can take place as fre-
quently as 10,000 times a minute if there 
are pre- and post-injection phases)

  the high flow-related stresses during fuel 

  the pressure and temperature of the com-

injection, and

bustion chamber.

The facts and figures below illustrate what 
modern nozzles are capable of.
  The pressure in the injection chamber can 
be as high as 2,200 bar. This is equivalent 
to the pressure produced by the weight of 
a large executive car acting on an area the 
size of a fingernail.

  The injection duration is 1...2 milliseconds 
(ms). In one millisecond, the sound wave 
from a loudspeaker would travel only 
about 33 cm.

  The injected fuel quantities on a car engine 
vary between 1 mm3 (pre-injection) and 
50 mm3 (full-load injected fuel quantity); 
on a commercial vehicle between 3 mm3 
(pre-injection) and 350 mm3 (full load). 
1 mm3 is equivalent to half the size of a 
pinhead. 350 mm3 is about the same as 
12 large raindrops (30 mm3 per raindrop). 
That amount of fuel is forced at a velocity 
of 2,000 km/h through an opening of less 
than 0.25 mm2 in the space of only 2 ms.

  The nozzle-needle guide clearance is 
0.002 mm (2 µm). A human hair is 30 
times as thick (0.06 mm).

Such high-precision technology demands an 
enormous amount of expertise in develop-
ment, materials, production, and measuring 
equipment.

Overview of common-rail systems

Areas of application

Overview of common-rail systems

The demands placed on diesel-engine 
fuel-injection systems are continuously
 increasing. Higher pressures, faster switching
times, and a variable rate-of-discharge curve
modified to the engine operating state have
made the diesel engine economical, clean,
and powerful. As a result, diesel engines 
have even entered the realm of  luxury-
performance sedans.

One of the advanced fuel-injection systems is
the common-rail (CR) fuel-injection system.
The main advantage of the common-rail sys-
tem is its ability to vary injection pressure
and timing over a broad scale. 
This was achieved by separating pressure 
generation (in the high-pressure pump) from
the fuel-injection system (injectors). The rail
here acts as a pressure accumulator.

Areas of application

The common-rail fuel-injection system for
engines with diesel direct injection  (Direct
Injection, DI) is used in the following vehi-
cles:
(cid:2) Passenger cars ranging from high-economy
3-cylinder engines with displacements of
800 cc, power outputs of 30 kW (41 HP),
torques of 100 Nm, and a fuel consump-
tion of 3.5 l/100 km through to 8-cylinder
engines in luxury-performance sedans 
with displacements of approx. 4 l, power
outputs of 180 kW (245 HP), and torques
of 560 Nm.

(cid:2) Light-duty trucks with engines producing

up to 30 kW/cylinder, and

(cid:2) Heavy-duty trucks, railway locomotives, and
ships with engines producing up to approx.
200 kW/cylinder

Overview of common-rail systems

Areas of application, design

115

The common-rail system is a highly flexible
system for adapting fuel injection to the en-
gine. This is achieved by:
(cid:2) High injection pressure up to approx. 
1,600 bar, in future up to 1,800 bar.

(cid:2) Injection pressure adapted to the operating

status (200...1,800 bar).
(cid:2) Variable start of injection.
(cid:2) Possibility of several pre-injection events
and secondary injection events (even
highly retarded secondary injection
events).

In this way, the common-rail system helps 
to raise specific power output, lower fuel 
consumption, reduce noise emission, and
 decrease pollutant emission in diesel engines.
Today common rail has become the most

commonly used fuel-injection system for
modern, high-rev passenger-car direct-
 injection engines.

Design

The common-rail system consists of the
 following main component groups 
(Figs. 1 and 2):
(cid:2) The low-pressure stage, comprising the fuel-

supply system components.

(cid:2) The high-pressure system, comprising com-
ponents such as the high-pressure pump,
fuel rail, injectors, and high-pressure fuel
lines.

(cid:2) The electronic diesel control (EDC), consist-
ing of system modules, such as sensors, the
electronic control unit, and actuators.

The key components of the common-rail 
system are the injectors. They are fitted 
with a rapid-action valve (solenoid valve 
or piezo-triggered actuator) which opens and
closes the nozzle. This permits control of the
injection process for each cylinder.

Overview of common-rail systems

Design, operating concept

All the injectors are fed by a common fuel
rail, this being the origin of the term “com-
mon rail”.

One of the main features of the common-
rail system is that system pressure is variable
dependent on the engine operating point.
Pressure is adjusted by the pressure-control
valve or the metering unit (Fig. 3).

The modular design of the common-rail sys-
tem simplifies modification of the system to
different engines.

Operating concept

In the common-rail fuel-injection system, the
functions of pressure generation and fuel in-
jection are separate. The injection pressure is
generated independent of the  engine speed
and the injected fuel quantity. The electronic
diesel control (EDC) controls each of the
components.

Pressure generation
Pressure generation and fuel injection are
separated by means of an accumulator vol-
ume. Fuel under pressure is supplied to the
accumulator volume of the common rail
ready for injection. 

A continuously operating high-pressure

pump driven by the engine produces the
 desired injection pressure. Pressure in the fuel
rail is maintained irrespective of engine speed
or injected fuel quantity. Owing to the almost
uniform injection pattern, the high-pressure
pump design can be much smaller and its
drive-system torque can be lower than con-
ventional fuel-injection systems. This results
in a much lower load on the pump drive.

The high-pressure pump is a radial-piston
pump. On commercial vehicles, an in-line
fuel-injection pump is sometimes fitted.

Pressure control
The pressure control method applied is
largely dependent on the system. 

Control on the high-pressure side
On passenger-car systems, the required rail
pressure is controlled on the high-pressure
side by a pressure-control valve (Fig. 3a, 4).
Fuel not required for injection flows back 
to the low-pressure circuit via the  pressure-
control valve. This type of control loop allows
rail pressure to react rapidly to changes in 
operating point (e.g. in the event of load
changes).

Overview of common-rail systems

Operating concept

117

The injector opening times and system
 pressure determine the quantity of fuel
 delivered. At a constant pressure, the fuel
quantity delivered is proportional to the
switching time of the solenoid valve. This is,
therefore, independent of engine or pump
speed (time-based fuel injection).

Potential hydraulic power
Separating the functions of pressure genera-
tion and fuel injection opens up further de-
grees of freedom in the combustion process
compared with conventional fuel-injection
systems; the injection pressure is more or less
freely selectable within the program map. 
The maximum injection pressure at present is
1,600 bar; in future this will rise to 1,800 bar. 
The common-rail system allows a further
reduction in exhaust-gas emissions by intro-
ducing pre-injection events or multiple injec-
tion events and also attenuating combustion
noise significantly. Multiple injection events
of up to five per injection cycle can be gener-
ated by triggering the highly rapid-action
switching valve several times. The nozzle-
needle closing action is hydraulically assisted
to ensure that the end of injection is rapid.

Control on the high-pressure side was
adopted on the first common-rail systems.
The pressure-control valve is mounted prefer-
ably on the fuel rail. In some applications,
however, it is mounted directly on the high-
pressure pump.

Fuel-delivery control on the suction side
Another way of controlling rail pressure is 
to control fuel delivery on the suction side
(Fig. 3b). The metering unit (10) flanged on
the high-pressure pump makes sure that the
pump delivers exactly the right quantity of
fuel to the fuel rail in order to maintain the
injection pressure required by the system. 
In a fault situation, the pressure-relief valve
(9) prevents rail pressure from exceeding a
 maximum. 

Fuel-delivery control on the suction side

reduces the quantity of fuel under high
 pressure and lowers the power input of the
pump. This has a positive impact on fuel con-
sumption. At the same time, the temperature
of the fuel flowing back to the fuel tank is 
reduced in contrast to the control method 
on the high-pressure side. 

Two-actuator system
The two-actuator system (Fig. 3c) combines
pressure control on the suction side via the
metering unit and control on the high-pres-
sure side via the pressure-control valve, thus
marrying the advantages of high-pressure-
side control and suction-side fuel-delivery
control (see the section on “Common-rail
system for passenger cars”).

Fuel injection
The injectors spray fuel directly into the 
engine’s combustion chambers. They are 
supplied by short high-pressure fuel lines
connected to the fuel rail. The engine control
unit controls the switching valve integrated 
in the injector to open and close the injector
nozzle. 

118

Overview of common-rail systems

Operating concept

Control and regulation
Operating concept
The engine control unit detects the accelera-
tor-pedal position and the current operating
states of the engine and vehicle by means of
sensors (see the section on “Electronic diesel
control”). The data collected includes:
(cid:2) Crankshaft speed and angle
(cid:2) Fuel-rail pressure
(cid:2) Charge-air pressure
(cid:2) Intake air, coolant temperature, and fuel

temperature
(cid:2) Air-mass intake
(cid:2) Road speed, etc.

The electronic control unit evaluates the
 input signals. In sync with combustion, it cal-
culates the triggering signals for the pressure-
control valve or the metering unit, the injec-
tors, and the other actuators (e.g. the EGR
valve, exhaust-gas turbocharger  actuators,
etc.).

The injector switching times, which need to
be short, are achievable using the optimized
high-pressure switching valves and a special
control system.

The angle/time system compares injection

timing, based on data from the crankshaft
and camshaft sensors, with the engine state
(time control). The electronic diesel control
(EDC) permits a precise metering of the in-
jected fuel quantity. In addition, EDC offers
the potential for additional functions that can
improve engine response and convenience.

Basic functions
The basic functions involve the precise con-
trol of diesel-fuel injection timing and fuel
quantity at the reference pressure. In this way,
they ensure that the diesel engine has low
consumption and smooth running character-
istics.

Correction functions for calculating 
fuel injection
A number of correction functions are avail-
able to compensate for tolerances between 
the fuel-injection system and the engine (see
the section on “Electronic diesel control”):
(cid:2) Injector delivery compensation
(cid:2) Zero delivery calibration
(cid:2) Fuel-balancing control
(cid:2) Average delivery adaption

Additional functions
Additional open- and closed-loop control
functions perform the tasks of reducing ex-
haust-gas emissions and fuel consumption, 
or providing added safety and convenience.
Some examples are:
(cid:2) Control of exhaust-gas recirculation
(cid:2) Boost-pressure control 
(cid:2) Cruise control
(cid:2) Electronic immobilizer, etc. 

Integrating EDC in an overall vehicle system
opens up a number of new opportunities, e.g.
data exchange with transmission control or
air-conditioning system.

A diagnosis interface permits analysis 
of stored system data when the vehicle 
is serviced.

Control unit configuration
As the engine control unit normally has 
a maximum of only eight output stages 
for the injectors, engines with more than
eight cylinders are fitted with two engine con-
trol units. They are coupled within the “mas-
ter/slave” network via an internal, high-speed
CAN interface. As a result, there is also a
higher microcontroller processing capacity
available. Some functions are permanently 
allocated to a specific control unit (e.g. fuel-
balancing control). Others can be dynami-
cally allocated to one or other of the control
units as situations demand (e.g. to detect 
sensor signals).

Diesel boom in Europe

119

(cid:1)

Diesel boom in Europe

Diesel engine applications 
At the start of automobile history, the spark-
 ignition engine (Otto cycle) was the drive unit
for road vehicles. The first time a diesel engine
was mounted on a truck was 1927. Passenger
cars had to wait until 1936.

The diesel engine made strong headway in

the truck sector due to its fuel economy and
long service life. By contrast, the diesel engine
in the car sector was long relegated to a
fringe existence. It was only with the introduc-
tion of supercharged direct-injection diesel
 engines – the principle of direct injection was
already used in the first truck diesel engines –
that the diesel engine changed its image.
Meanwhile, the percentage of diesel-engined
passenger cars among new registrations is
fast approaching 50% in Europe.

Features of the diesel engine 
What is the reason for the boom in diesel
 engines in Europe? 

Fuel economy
Firstly, fuel consumption compared to gasoline
engines is still lower – this is due to the greater
efficiency of the diesel engine. Secondly, 
diesel fuel is subject to lower taxes in most
 European countries. For people who travel a
lot, therefore, diesel is the more economical
 alternative despite the higher purchase price.

Driving pleasure
Almost all diesel engines on the market are
 supercharged. This produces a high cylinder
charge at low revs. The metered fuel quantity
can also be high, and this produces high en-
gine torque. The result is a torque curve that
permits driving at high torque and low revs. 

It is torque, and not engine performance, 
that is the decisive factor for engine power.
Compared to a gasoline engine without
 supercharging, a driver can experience more
“driving pleasure” with a diesel engine of
lower performance. The image of the “stinking
slowcoach” is simply no longer true for diesel-
engined cars of the latest generation.

Environmental compatibility
The clouds of smoke that diesel-engined cars
produced when driven at high loads are a
thing of the past. This was brought about by
improved fuel-injection systems and electronic
diesel control (EDC). These systems can me-
ter fuel quantity with high precision, adjusting
it to the engine operating point and environ-
mental conditions. This technology also meets
prevailing exhaust-gas emission standards.
Oxidation-type catalytic converters, that
 remove carbon monoxide (CO) and hydro -
carbons (HC) from exhaust gas, are standard
equipment on diesel engines. Future, more
stringent exhaust-gas emission standards, and
even U.S. legislation, will be met by other ex-
haust-gas treatment systems, such as particu-
late filters and NOx accumulator-type catalytic
converters.

Overview of common-rail systems

Common-rail system for passenger cars

Common-rail system for
 passenger cars

Fuel supply
In common-rail systems for passenger cars,
electric fuel pumps or gear pumps are used to
deliver fuel to the high-pressure pump. 

Systems with electric fuel pump
The electric fuel pump is either part of the in-
tank unit (in the fuel tank) or is fitted in the
fuel line (in-line). It intakes fuel via a pre-fil-
ter and delivers it to the high-pressure pump
at a pressure of 6 bar (Fig. 3). The maximum
delivery rate is 190 l/h. To ensure fast engine
starting, the pump switches on as soon as the
driver turns the ignition key. This builds up
the necessary pressure in the low-pressure
circuit when the engine starts.

The fuel filter (fine filter) is fitted in the

supply line to the high-pressure pump.

Systems with gear pump
The gear pump is flanged to the high-pres-
sure pump and is driven by its input shaft
(Figs. 1 and 2). In this way, the gear pump
starts delivery only after the engine has
started. Delivery rate is dependent on the 
engine speed and reaches rates up to 400 l/h
at pressures up to 7 bar.

A fuel pre-filter is fitted in the fuel tank.
The fine filter is located in the supply line to
the gear pump.

Combination systems 
There are also applications where the two
pump types are used. The electric fuel pump
improves starting response, in particular for
hot starts, since the delivery rate of the gear
pump is lower when the fuel is hot, and
therefore, thinner, and at low pump speeds.

High-pressure control
On first-generation common-rail systems,
rail pressure is controlled by the pressure-
control valve. The high-pressure pump 
(type CP1) generates the maximum delivery
quantity, irrespective of fuel demand. The
pressure-control valve returns excess fuel to
the fuel tank.

Second-generation common-rail systems
control rail pressure on the low-pressure side
by means of the metering unit (Figs. 1 and 2).
The high-pressure pump (types CP3 and
CP1H) need only deliver the fuel quantity
that the engine actually requires. This lowers
the energy demand of the high-pressure
pump and reduces fuel consumption.

Third-generation common-rail systems

feature piezo-inline injectors (Fig. 3).

If pressure is only adjustable on the low-pres-
sure side, it takes too long to lower the pres-
sure in the fuel rail when rapid negative load
changes occur. Adapting pressure to  dynamic
changes in load conditions is then too slow.
This is particularly the case with piezo-inline
injectors due to their very low internal leak-
age. For this reason, some common-rail sys-
tems are equipped with an additional pres-
sure-control valve (Fig. 3) besides the high-
pressure pump and metering unit. This
two-actuator system combines the advantages
of control on the low-pressure side with the
dynamic response of control on the high-
pressure side. 

Another advantage compared with control
on the low-pressure side only is that the high-
pressure side is also controllable when the en-
gine is cold. The high-pressure pump then
delivers more fuel than is injected and pres-
sure is controlled by the pressure-control
valve. Compression heats the fuel, thus elimi-
nating the need for an additional fuel heater.

Overview of diesel fuel-injection systems

Areas of application
Diesel engines are characterized by high fuel
economy. Since the first volume-production
fuel-injection pump was introduced by Bosch
in 1927, fuel-injection systems have experi-
enced a process of continuous development.

Requirements
Ever stricter statutory regulations on noise and
exhaust-gas emissions and the desire for more
economical fuel consumption continually place
greater demands on the fuel-injection system
of a diesel engine.

Diesel engines are used in a wide variety of
design for many different purposes (Fig. 1 and
Table 1), for example
(cid:1) To drive mobile power generators 
(up to approx. 10 kW/cylinder)
(cid:1) As fast-running engines for cars 

and light-duty trucks 
(up to approx. 50 kW/cylinder)

(cid:1) As engines for construction-industry 

and agricultural machinery 
(up to approx. 50 kW/cylinder)

(cid:1) As engines for heavy trucks, 

omnibuses and tractor vehicles 
(up to approx. 80 kW/cylinder)
(cid:1) To drive fixed installations such 

as emergency power generators 
(up to approx. 160 kW/cylinder)
(cid:1) As engines for railway locomotives 
and ships (up to 1,000 kW/cylinder)

1

Applications for Bosch diesel fuel-injection systems

Basically, the fuel-injection system is required
to inject a precisely metered amount of fuel at
high pressure into the combustion chamber 
in such a way that it mixes effectively with the
air in the cylinder as demanded by the type 
of engine (direct or indirect-injection) and its
present operating status. The power output
and speed of a diesel engine is controlled by
means of the injected fuel quantity as it has no
air intake throttle.

Mechanical control of diesel fuel-injection
 systems is being increasingly replaced by
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) systems. 
All new diesel-injection systems for cars 
and commercial vehicles are electronically
controlled.

Fuel filtering
As opposed to passenger-car systems, the fuel
filter (fine filter) is fitted to the pressure side.
For this reason, an exterior fuel inlet is re-
quired, in particular when the gear pump is

Presupply
Common-rail systems for light-duty trucks
differ very little from passenger-car systems.
Electric fuel pumps or gear pumps are used
for fuel presupply. On common-rail systems
for heavy-duty trucks, only gear pumps are
used to deliver fuel to the high-pressure
pump (see the subsection “Gear-type supply
pumps” in the section “Fuel supply in the
low-pressure stage”). The presupply pump is
normally flanged to the high-pressure pump

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Overview

High-pressure components of common-rail system

The high-pressure stage of the common-rail
system is divided into three sections: pres-
sure generation, pressure storage, and fuel
metering. The high-pressure pump assumes
the function of pressure generation. Pres-
sure storage takes place in the fuel rail to
which the rail-pressure sensor and the pres-
sure-control and pressure-relief valves are
fitted. The function of the injectors is cor-
rect timing and metering the quantity of

fuel injected. High-pressure fuel lines inter-
connect the three sections.

Overview

The main difference in the various genera-
tions of common-rail systems lie in the de-
sign of the high-pressure pump and the in-
jectors, and in the system functions required
(Table 1).

Cleanliness requirements

Cleanliness requirements

Cleanliness quality 
The sharp rise in the performance of new
 assemblies, e.g. the common-rail system for
high-pressure diesel fuel injection, requires ex-
treme precision in machining, and ever tighter
tolerances and fits. Particle residue from the
production process may lead to increased
wear, or even the total failure of the assembly.
This results in high requirements and tight tol-
erances for cleanliness quality, with a continu-
ous reduction in the permitted particle size.
The cleanliness quality of components 
is currently determined in the production
process by light-microscope image-analysis
systems. They supply information on particle-
size distribution. Additional information, such
as the nature of the particles and their chemi-
cal composition, is required to develop innova-
tive cleaning processes. This information is
obtained by electron microscopes.

Particle-analysis system (SEM)
Bosch uses a particle-analysis system based
on a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).
This system performs an automated analysis
of particles adhering to a product. The results
of the analysis show particle-size distribution,
the chemical composition of the particles, and
images of the individual particles. Using this
information, the source of the particles are
identifiable. Action can then be taken to avoid,
reduce, or wash off certain particle types. 
In this way, solutions are not based on the
 increased use of cleaning techniques, but on
avoiding and reducing residual soiling during
the production process. 

The automated particle-analysis system
(SEM) provides the cleanliness process with
an analysis system that produces important
 information on the type of residual soiling. 
The precise identification of particles and their
sources is vital to developing new cleaning
techniques.

and the camshaft position (phase detection). 
An optimum mixture formation is re-
quired to reduce exhaust-gas emissions and
comply with continuous demands to reduce
the noise of diesel engines. This calls for in-
jectors with very small pre-injection quanti-
ties and multiple injection events.

There are presently three different injector
types in serial production:
(cid:1) Solenoid-valve injectors with one-part

(cid:1) Injector with piezo actuator

Injector

On a common-rail diesel injection system,
the injectors are connected to the fuel rail by
short high-pressure fuel lines. The injectors
are sealed to the combustion chamber by a
copper gasket. The injectors are fitted into 
the cylinder head by means of taper locks.
Depending on the injection-nozzle design,
common-rail injectors are intended for
straight or inclined mounting in direct-
 injection diesel engines.

One of the system’s features is that it gener-
ates an injection pressure irrespective of
 engine speed or injected fuel quantity. The
start of injection and injected fuel quantity
are controlled by the electrically triggered 
injector. The injection time is controlled 
by the angle/time system of the Electronic
Diesel Control (EDC). This requires the use

fuel return (1) via the outlet restrictor (12)
which can be opened by a solenoid valve.

Operating concept
The function of the injector can be subdi-
vided into four operating states when the 
engine and the high-pressure pump are
 operating:
(cid:1) Injector closed (with high pressure

 applied)

(cid:1) Injector opens (start of injection)
(cid:1) Injector fully open
(cid:1) Injector closes (end of injection)

The operating states are caused by the balance
of forces acting on the injector components.
When the engine is not running and the fuel
rail is not pressurized, the nozzle spring closes
the injector.

Injector closed (resting position)
In its resting position, the injector is not trig-
gered (Fig. 1a). The solenoid-valve spring
(11) presses the valve ball (5) onto the seat of
the outlet restrictor (12). Inside of the valve-
control chamber, the pressure rises to the
pressure in the fuel rail. The same pressure is
also applied to the chamber volume (9) of the
nozzle. The forces applied by the rail pressure
to the end faces of the control plunger (15),
and the force of the nozzle spring (7) retain
the nozzle needle closed against the opening
force applied to its pressure shoulders (8).

Injector opens (start of injection)
To begin with, the injector is in its resting po-
sition. The solenoid valve is triggered by the
“pickup current”. This makes the solenoid
valve open very rapidly (Fig. 1b). The re-
quired rapid switching times are achieved by
controlling solenoid-valve triggering in the
ECU at high voltages and currents.

The magnetic force of the now triggered
electromagnet exceeds the force of the valve
spring. The armature raises the valve ball
from the valve seat and opens the outlet
 restrictor. After a short time the increased
pickup current is reduced to a lower holding
current in the electromagnet. When the  outlet
restrictor opens, fuel flows from the valve-
control chamber to the cavity above and then
via the fuel-return line to the fuel tank. The
inlet restrictor (14) prevents a complete pres-
sure compensation. As a result, pressure in
the valve-control chamber drops. Pressure 
in the valve-control chamber falls below the
pressure in the nozzle chamber, which is still
the same as the pressure in the fuel rail. The
reduction in pressure in the valve-control
chamber reduces the force acting on the 
control plunger and opens the nozzle needle.
Fuel injection commences.

Injector fully open
The rate of movement of the nozzle needle is
determined by the difference in the flow rates
through the inlet and outlet restrictors. The
control plunger reaches its upper stop and
dwells there on a cushion of fuel (hydraulic
stop). The cushion is created by the flow of
fuel between the inlet and outlet  restrictors.
The injector nozzle is then fully open. Fuel is
injected into the combustion chamber at a
pressure approaching that in the fuel rail.
The balance of forces in the injector is 
similar to that during the opening phase. 
At a given system pressure, the fuel quantity
injected is proportional to the length of time
that the solenoid valve is open. This is entirely
independent of the engine or pump speed
(time-based injection system).

132

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Injector closes (end of injection)
When the solenoid valve is no longer trig-
gered, the valve spring presses the armature
down and the valve ball closes the outlet re-
strictor (Fig. 1c). When the outlet restrictor
closes, pressure in the control chamber rises
again to that in the fuel rail via the inlet re-
strictor. The higher pressure exerts a greater
force on the control plunger. The force on the
valve-control chamber and the nozzle-spring
force then exceed the force acting on the 
nozzle needle, and the nozzle needle closes.
The flow rate of the inlet restrictor determines
the closing speed of the nozzle needle. The
fuel-injection cycle comes to an end when the
nozzle needle is resting against its seat, thus
closing off the injection orifices.

This indirect method is used to trigger the
nozzle needle by means of a hydraulic servo
system because the forces required to open the
nozzle needle rapidly cannot be generated di-
rectly by the solenoid valve. The  “control vol-
ume” required in addition to the injected fuel
quantity reaches the fuel-return line via the 
restrictors in the control chamber. 

In addition to the control volume, there are
also leakage volumes through the nozzle-nee-
dle and valve-plunger guides. The control and
leakage volumes are returned to the fuel tank
via the fuel-return line and a collective line
that comprises an overflow valve, high-pres-
sure pump, and pressure-control valve.

Program-map variants
Program maps with fuel-quantity flat curve
With injectors, a distinction is made in the
program map between ballistic and non -
ballistic modes. The valve plunger/nozzle
needle unit reaches the hydraulic stop if the
triggering period in vehicle operation is of
sufficient length (Fig. 2a). The section until
the nozzle needle reaches its maximum stroke
is termed ballistic mode. The ballistic and
nonballistic sections in the fuel-quantity
map, where the injected fuel quantity is ap-
plied for the triggering period (Fig. 2b), is
separated by a kink in the program map. 
Another feature of the fuel-quantity map is

the flat curve that occurs with small triggering
periods. The flat curve is caused by the sole-
noid armature rebounding on opening. In this
section, the injected fuel quantity is indepen-
dent on the triggering period. This allows
small injected fuel quantities to be represented
as stable. Only after the armature has stopped
rebounding does the  injected fuel quantity
curve continue to rise linearly as the triggering
period becomes longer. 

Injection events with small injected fuel
quantities (short triggering periods) are used
as pre-injection in order to suppress noise.
Secondary injection events help to  enhance
soot oxidation in selected sections of the 
operating curve.

Program maps without fuel-quantity flat curve
The increasing stringency of emission-control
legislation has lead to the use of the two sys-
tem functions: injector delivery compensation
(IMA) and zero delivery calibration (NMK), as
well as to short intervals in injection between
pre-injection, main injection, and secondary
injection events. With injectors that have no
flat-curve section, IMA  allows a precise ad-
justment of the pre-injection fuel quantity
when new. NMK corrects fuel-quantity drifts
over time in the low-pressure section. The key
condition for deploying these two system
functions is a constant, linear rise in quantity,
i.e. there is no flat curve in the fuel-quantity
map (Fig. 2c). If the valve plunger/nozzle nee-
dle unit is operated in nominal mode without
lift-stop at the same time, this represents a
fully ballistic operating mode of the valve
plunger and there is no kink in the fuel-quan-
tity map. 

Injector variants
A distinction is made between two different
solenoid-valve concepts with solenoid-valve
injectors: 
(cid:1) Injectors with one-part armature 

(cid:1) Injectors with two-part armature 

(1-spring system)

(2-spring system)

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

133

The short intervals between injection events
are ensured when the armature can return to
its resting position very rapidly on closing.
This is best achieved by a two-part armature
with an overstroke stop. During the closing
process, the armature plate moves down by
positive locking. The bottoming-out of the
armature plate is limited by an overstroke
stop. As a result, the armature reaches its
resting position faster. Armature rebound 

on closing can end faster by decoupling the
armature masses and adapting the setting
parameters. This helps to achieve shorter
 intervals between two injection events with
the two-part armature concept.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Holding-current phase
In order to reduce power loss in the ECU and
injector, the current is dropped to approx.
13 A in the holding-current phase. 
The energy which becomes available when
pickup current and holding current are
 reduced is routed to the booster-voltage
 capacitor. 

Switchoff
When the current is switched off in order 
to close the solenoid valve, the surplus energy
is also routed to the booster-voltage  capacitor.

Recharging the step-up chopper
Recharging takes place by means of a step-up
chopper integrated in the ECU. The energy
tapped during the opening phase is recharged
at the start of the pickup phase until the orig-
inal voltage required to open the solenoid
valve is reached.

Triggering the solenoid-valve injector
In its resting position, the injector’s high-
pressure solenoid valve is not triggered and is
therefore closed. The injector injects when
the solenoid valve opens. 

Triggering the solenoid valve is divided into

five phases (Figs. 3 and 4).

Opening phase
Initially, in order to ensure tight tolerances
and high levels of reproducibility for the in-
jected fuel quantity, the current for opening
the solenoid valve features a steep, precisely
defined flank and increases rapidly up to
 approx. 20 A. This is achieved by means of a
booster voltage of up to 50 V. It is generated 
in the control unit and stored in a capacitor
(booster-voltage capacitor). When this volt-
age is applied across the solenoid valve, the
current increases several times faster than it
does when only battery voltage is used.

Pickup-current phase
During the pickup-current phase, battery
voltage is applied to the solenoid valve and
assists in opening it quickly. Current control
limits pickup current to approx. 20 A.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Piezo-inline injector
Design and requirements
The design of the piezo-inline injector 
is divided into its main modules in the
schematic (see Fig. 5):
(cid:1) Actuator module (3) 
(cid:1) Hydraulic coupler or translator (4) 
(cid:1) Control or servo valve (5) 
(cid:1) Nozzle module (6)

The design of the injector took account of the
high overall rigidity required within the actu-
ator chain composed of actuator, hydraulic
coupler, and control valve. Another design
feature is the avoidance of mechanical forces

acting on the nozzle needle. Such forces oc-
curred as a result of the push rod used on
previous solenoid-valve injectors. On aggre-
gate, this design effectively reduces the mov-
ing masses and friction, thus enhancing injec-
tor stability and drift compared to conven-
tional systems.

In addition, the fuel-injection system
 allows the implementation of very short in-
tervals (“hydraulic zero”) between injection
events. The number and configuration of
fuel-metering operations can represent up 
to five injection events per injection cycle in
order to adapt the requirements to the  engine
operating points.

A direct response of the needle to actuator

operation is achieved by coupling the servo
valve (5) to the nozzle needle. The delay
 between the electric start of triggering and
hydraulic response of the nozzle needle is
about 150 microseconds. This meets the con-
tradictory requirements of high needle speeds
and extremely small reproducible  injected
fuel quantities.

As a result of this principle, the injector also

includes small direct leakage points from the
high-pressure section to the low-pressure cir-
cuit. The result is an increase in the hydraulic
efficiency of the overall system.

Operating concept
Function of the 3/2-way servo valve in the 
CR injector
The nozzle needle on piezo-inline injector 
is controlled indirectly by a servo valve. 
The required injected fuel quantity is then
controlled by the valve triggering period. 
In its non-triggered state, the actuator is 
in the starting position and the servo valve 
is closed (Fig. 6a), i.e. the high-pressure
 section is separated from the low-pressure
 section.

The nozzle is kept closed by the rail pressure
exerted in the control chamber (3). When the
piezo actuator is triggered, the servo valve
opens and closes the bypass passage (Fig. 6b).
The flow-rate ratio between the outlet restric-
tor (2) and the inlet restrictor (4) lowers pres-
sure in the control chamber and the nozzle
(5) opens. The control volume flows via the
servo valve to the low-pressure circuit of the
overall system.

To start the closing process, the actuator 

is discharged and the servo valve releases 
the bypass passage. The control chamber is
then refilled by reversing the inlet and outlet
restrictors, and pressure in the control cham-
ber is raised. As soon as the required pressure
is attained, the nozzle needle starts to move
and the injection process ends. 

The valve design described above and the
greater dynamic design of the actuator system
result in much shorter injection times com-
pared to injectors of conventional design, i.e.
push rod and 2/2-way valve.  Ultimately, this
has a positive impact on  exhaust-gas emis-
sions and engine performance. Due to re-
quirements regarding the engine in EU 4, the
injector program maps were optimized to 
apply corrective functions (injector delivery
compensation (IMA) and zero delivery cali-

bration (NMK). The pre-injection quantity
can then be selected at will, and IMA can
minimize the quantity spread in the program
map using full ballistic mode (see Fig. 7).

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Injector

Function of the hydraulic coupler
Another key component in the piezo-inline
injector is the hydraulic coupler (Fig. 8, 3)
that implements the following functions:
(cid:1) Translates and amplifies the actuator

stroke.

(cid:1) Compensates for any play between the

 actuator and the servo valve (e.g. caused 
by thermal expansion).

(cid:1) Performs a failsafe function (automatic
safety cutoff of fuel injection if electrical
decontacting fails).

The actuator module and the hydraulic coupler
are immersed in the diesel fuel flow at a pres-
sure of about 10 bar. When the actuator is not
triggered, pressure in the hydraulic coupler is in
equilibrium with its surroundings. Changes in
length caused by temperature are compensated
by small leakage-fuel quantities via the guide
clearances of the two plungers. This maintains
the coupling of forces between  actuator and
switching valve at all times. 

8

Function of the hydraulic coupler

To generate an injection event, a voltage
(110...150 V) is applied to the actuator 
until the equilibrium of forces between the
switch ing valve and the actuator is exceeded.
This increases the pressure in the coupler, and
a small leakage volume flows out of the cou-
pler via the piston guide clearances into the
low-pressure circuit of the injector. The pres-
sure drop caused in the coupler has no im-
pact on injector function for a triggering 
period lasting several milliseconds.

At the end of the injection process, the
quantity missing in the hydraulic coupler
needs refilling. This takes place in the reverse
direction via the guide clearances of the
plungers as a result of the pressure difference
between the hydraulic coupler and the low-
pressure circuit of the injector. The guide
clearances and the low-pressure level are
matched to fill up the hydraulic coupler fully
before the next injection cycle starts.

Triggering sequences of the piezo-inline injector for an injection event

Triggering the common-rail piezo 
in-line injector
The injector is triggered by an engine control
unit whose output stage was specially designed
for these injectors. A reference triggering volt-
age is predetermined as a function of the rail
pressure of the set operating point. The voltage
signal is pulsed (Fig. 9) until there is a mini-
mum deviation between the reference and the
control voltage. The voltage rise is converted
proportionally into a piezoelectric actuator
stroke. The actuator stroke produces a pressure
rise in the coupler by means of hydraulic
translation until the equilibrium of forces is
exceeded at the switching valve, and the valve
opens. As soon as the
switching valve reaches
its end position, pres-
sure in the control
chamber starts to 
drop via the needle,
and injection ends.

The piezoelectric effect

(cid:0)

The piezoelectric effect

In 1880 Pierre Curie and his brother Jacques
discovered a phenomenon that is still very lit-
tle known today, but is present in the everyday
lives of millions of people: the piezoelectric
 effect. For example, it keeps the pointers of 
a crystal clock operating in time.

Certain crystals (e.g. quartz and turmaline) are
piezoelectric: Electric charges are induced on
the crystal surface by exerting a compression
or elongation force along certain crystal axes.
This electrical polarization arises by shifting
positive and negative ions in the crystal rela-
tive to each other by exerting force (see Fig.,
b). The shifted centers of charge gravity within
the crystal compensate automatically, but an
electric field forms between the end faces of
the crystal. Compressing and elongating the
crystal create inverse field directions.

On the other hand, if an electrical voltage 
is applied to the end faces of the crystal, the
effect reverses (inverse piezoelectric effect):
The positive ions in the electric field migrate
toward the negative electrode, and negative
ions toward the positive electrode. The crystal
then contracts or expands depending on the
direction of the electric field strength (see
Fig., c). 

The following applies to piezoelectric field
strength Ep:
Ep = δ ∆x/x
∆x/x: relative compression or elongation
δ:

piezoelectric coefficient, numeric value
109 V/cm through 1011 V/cm

The change in length ∆x results from the
 following when a voltage U is applied: 
U / δ = ∆x (using quartz as an example:
 deformation of about 10–9 cm at U = 10 V)

The piezoelectric effect is not only used in
quartz clocks and piezo-inline injectors, it has
many other industrial applications, either as a
direct or inverse effect: 

Piezoelectric sensors are used for knock
control in gasoline engines. For example, they
detect high-frequency engine vibrations as a
feature of combustion knock. Converting me-
chanical vibration to electric voltage is also
used in the crystal audio pickup of a record
player or crystal microphones. The piezoelec-
tric igniter (e.g. in a firelighter) causes me-
chanical pressure to produce the voltage to
generate a spark.

On the other hand, if an alternating voltage

is applied to a piezoelectrical crystal, it vi-
brates mechanically at the same frequency 
as the alternating voltage. Oscillating crystals
are used as stabilizers in electrical oscillating
circuits or as piezoelectric acoustic sources 
to generate ultrasound. 

When used in clocks, the oscillating quartz

is excited by an alternating voltage whose
 frequency is the same as the quartz’s natural
frequency. This is how an extremely time-con-
stant resonant frequency is generated. In a
calibrated quartz, it deviates by only approx.
1/1,000 second per year.

Where does the word “electronics” come from?

141

(cid:0)

Where does the word “electronics” come from?

This term actually goes back to the ancient
Greeks. For them, the word “electron” meant
amber. Its force of attraction on woollen
threads or similar was known to Thales von
Milet over 2,500 years ago. 

Electrons, and therefore electronics as such,
are extremely fast due to their very small mass
and electric charge. The term “electronics”
comes directly from the word “electron”.

The mass of an electron has as little effect
on a gram of any given substance as a 5 gram
weight has on the total mass of our earth. 

The word “electronics” was born in the
20th century. There is no evidence available
as to when the word was used for the first
time. It could be Sir John Ambrose Fleming,
one of the inventors of the electron tube in
about 1902.

Even the first “Electronic Engineer” already
 existed in the 19th century. Fleming was listed
in the 1888 edition of “Who’s Who”, pub-
lished during the reign of Queen Victoria. The
official title was “Kelly’s Handbook of Titled,
Landed and Official Classes”. The Electronic
Engineer can be found under the title “Royal
Warrant Holders”, that is the list of persons
who had been awarded a Royal Warrant. 

What was this Electronic Engineer’s job?
He was responsible for the correct functioning
and cleanliness of the gas lamps at court. 
And why did he have such a splendid title?
Because he knew that “electrons” in ancient
Greece stood for glitter, shine, and sparkle.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

The pump plunger inside of the high-pres-
sure pump compresses the fuel. At three
 delivery strokes per revolution, the radial-
piston pump produces overlapping delivery
strokes (no interruption in delivery), low
drive peak torques, and an even load on the
pump drive. 

On passenger-car systems, torque reaches

16 Nm, i.e. only 1/9th of the drive torque
 required for a comparable distributor injec-
tion pump. As a result, the common-rail
 system places fewer demands on the pump-
drive system than conventional fuel-injection
systems. The power required to drive the
pump increases in proportion to the pressure
in the fuel rail and the rotational speed of the
pump (delivery quantity). 
On a 2-liter engine, the high-pressure pump
draws a power of 3.8 kW at nominal speed
and a pressure of 1,350 bar in the fuel rail 
(at a mechanical efficiency of approx. 90%).
The higher power requirements of common-
rail systems compared to conventional fuel-
injection systems is caused by leakage and
control volumes in the injector, and – on the
high-pressure pump CP1 – the pressure drop
to the required system pressure across the
pressure-control valve.

The high-pressure radial-piston pumps used
in passenger cars are lubricated by fuel. Com-
mercial-vehicle systems may have fuel- or 
oil-lubricated radial-piston pumps, as well as
oil-lubricated 2-plunger in-line fuel-injection
pumps. Oil-lubricated pumps are more ro-
bust against poor fuel quality.

High-pressure pumps are used in a number
of different designs in passenger cars and
commercial vehicles. There are versions of
pump generations that have different delivery
rates and delivery pressures (Table 1).

High-pressure pumps

Design and requirements
The high-pressure pump is the interface 
between the low-pressure and high-pressure
stages. Its function is to make sure there is al-
ways sufficient fuel under pressure available
in all engine operating conditions. At the
same time it must operate for the entire 
service life of the vehicle. This includes
 providing a fuel reserve that is required for
quick engine starting and rapid pressure rise
in the fuel rail.

The high-pressure pump generates a con-
stant system pressure for the high-pressure 
accumulator (fuel rail) independent of fuel 
injection. For this reason, fuel – compared to
conventional fuel-injection systems – is not
compressed during the injection process.

A 3-plunger radial-piston pump is used as the
high-pressure pump to generate pressure in
passenger-car systems. 2-plunger in-line fuel-
injection pumps are also used on commercial
vehicles. Preferably, the high-pressure pump
is fitted to the diesel engine at the same point
as a conventional distributor injection pump.
The pump is driven by the engine via cou-
pling, gearwheel, chain, or toothed belt.
Pump speed is therefore coupled to engine
speed via a fixed gear ratio.

behind the inlet. If the delivery pressure of
the presupply pump exceeds the opening
pressure (0.5 to 1.5 bar) of the safety valve,
the fuel is pressed through the restriction
bore of the safety valve into the lubrication
and cooling circuit of the high-pressure
pump. The drive shaft with its eccenter moves
the pump plunger up and down to mimic the
eccentric lift. Fuel passed through the high-
pressure pump’s inlet valve (4) into the ele-
ment chamber and the pump plunger moves
downward (inlet stroke). 

When the bottom-dead center of the pump

plunger is exceeded, the inlet valve closes, 
and the fuel in the element chamber can no
longer escape. It can then be pressurized be-
yond the delivery pressure of the presupply
pump. The rising pressure opens the outlet
valve (5) as soon as pressure reaches the level
in the fuel rail. The pressurized fuel then
passes to the high-pressure circuit.

Radial-piston pump (CP1)
Design 
The drive shaft in the housing of CP1 is
mounted in a central bearing (Fig. 1, 1). 
The pump elements (3) are arranged radially
with respect to the central bearing and offset
by 120°. The eccenter (2) fitted to the drive
shaft forces the pump plunger to move up
and down.

Force is transmitted between the eccentric
shaft and the delivery plunger by means of 
a drive roller, a sliding ring mounted on the
shaft eccenter, and a plunger base plate at-
tached to the plunger base plate.

Operating concept
Fuel delivery and compression
The presupply pump – an electric fuel pump
or a mechanically driven gear pump – deliv-
ers fuel via a filter and water separator to the
inlet of the high-pressure pump (6). The inlet
is located inside of the pump on passenger-
car systems with a gear pump flanged to the
high-pressure pump. A safety valve is fitted

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

Delivery rate
As the high-pressure pump is designed for
high delivery quantities, there is a surplus 
of pressurized fuel when the engine is idling
or running in part-load range. On first-
 generation systems with a CP1, excess fuel 
delivered is returned to the fuel tank by the
pressure-control valve on the fuel rail. As 
the compressed fuel expands, the energy
 imparted by compression is lost; overall
 efficiency drops. Compressing and then
 expanding the fuel also heats the fuel.

The pump plunger continues to deliver fuel
until it reaches its top-dead center position
(delivery stroke). The pressure then drops so
that the outlet valve closes. The remaining
fuel is depressurized and the pump plunger
moves downward.

When the pressure in the element chamber

exceeds the pre-delivery pressure, the inlet
valve reopens, and the process starts over.

Transmission ratio
The delivery quantity of a high-pressure
pump is proportional to its rotational speed.
In turn, the pump speed is dependent on 
the engine speed. The transmission ratio
 between the engine and the pump is deter-
mined in the process of adapting the fuel-
 injection system to the engine so as to limit
the volume of excess fuel delivered. At the
same time it makes sure that the engine’s fuel
demand at WOT is covered to the full extent.
Possible gear ratios are 1:2 or 2:3  relative to
the crankshaft.

Metering unit design

Radial-piston pump (CP1H)
Modifications
An improvement in energetic efficiency is
possible by controlling fuel delivery by the
high-pressure pump on the fuel-delivery side
(suction side). Fuel flowing into the pump el-
ement is metered by an infinitely variable so-
lenoid valve (metering unit, ZME). This valve
adapts the fuel quantity delivered to the rail
to system demand. This fuel-delivery control
not only drops the  performance demand of
the high-pressure pump, it also reduces the
maximum fuel temperature. This system de-
signed for the CP1H was taken over by the
CP3.

Compared to the high-pressure pump CP1,
the CP1H is designed for higher pressures up
to 1,600 bar. This was achieved by reinforcing
the drive mechanism, modifying the valve
units, and introducing measures to increase
the strength of the pump housing.

The metering unit is mounted on the high-

pressure pump (Fig. 3, 13).

High-pressure components of common-rail system

High-pressure pumps

Radial-piston pump (CP3)
Modifications
The CP3 is a high-pressure pump with suc-
tion-side fuel-delivery control by means of a
metering unit (ZME). This control was first
used on the CP3 and was assumed later on
the CP1H. 

The principle design of the CP3 (Fig. 5) is
similar to the CP1 and the CP1H. The main
difference in features are:
(cid:0) Monobloc housing: This construction

 reduces the number of leak points in the
high-pressure section, and permits a higher
delivery rate.

(cid:0) Bucket tappets: Transverse forces arising
from the transverse movement of the
 eccenter drive roller are not removed di-
rectly by the pump plungers but by buckets
on the housing wall. The pump then has
greater stability under load and is  capable
of withstanding higher pressures. Poten-
tially, it can withstand pressures up to 
1,800 bar.

Variants
Pumps of the CP3 family are used in both
passenger cars and commercial vehicles. 
A number of different variants are used
 depending on the delivery rate required. 
The size, and thus the delivery rate, increases
from the CP3.2 to the CP3.4. The oil-lubri-
cated CP3.4 is only used on heavy-duty
trucks. On light-duty trucks and vans, pumps
primarily designed for passenger cars may
also be used.

A special feature of systems for medium-
duty and heavy-duty trucks is the fuel filter
located on the pressure side. It is situated be-
tween the gear pump and the high-pressure
pump, and permits a greater filter storage ca-
pacity before requiring a change. The high-
pressure pump requires an external connec-
tion for the fuel inlet in any case, even if the
gear pump is flanged onto the high-pressure
pump.

Lube oil is supplied either directly via the
mounting flange of the CP2 or a side-
mounted inlet.

The drive gear ratio is 1:2. The CP2 is there-
fore mountable together with conventional
in-line fuel-injection pumps. 

Operating concept
Fuel enters the pump element and the com-
pressed fuel is conveyed to the fuel rail via a
combined inlet/outlet valve on the CP2. 

In-line piston pump (CP2)
Design
The oil-lubricated, quantity-controlled high-
pressure pump (CP2) is only used on com-
mercial vehicles. This is a 2-plunger pump
with an in-line design, i.e. the two pump
plungers are arranged adjacently (Fig. 6). 

A gear pump with a high gear ratio is lo-
cated on the camshaft extension. Its function
is to draw fuel from the fuel tank and route it
to the fine filter. From there, the fuel passes
through another line to the metering unit lo-
cated on the upper section of the high-pres-
sure pump. The metering unit controls the
fuel quantity delivered for compression de-
pendent on actual demand in the same way as
other common-rail high-pressure pumps of
the recent generation.

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Fuel rail (high-pressure accumulator)

Fuel rail (high-pressure
 accumulator)

Function
The function of the high-pressure accumula-
tor (fuel rail) is to maintain the fuel at high
pressure. In so doing, the accumulator vol-
ume has to dampen pressure fluctuations
caused by fuel pulses delivered by the pump
and the fuel-injection cycles. This ensures
that, when the injector opens, the injection
pressure remains constant. On the one hand,
the accumulator volume must be large
enough to meet this requirement. On the
other hand, it must be small enough to en-
sure a fast enough pressure rise on engine
start. Simulation calculations are conducted
during the design phase to optimize the per-
formance features.

Besides acting as a fuel accumulator, the
fuel rail also distributes fuel to the injectors.

Design
The tube-shaped fuel rail (Fig. 1, 1) can have
as many designs as there are engine mounting
variants. It has mountings for the rail-pres-
sure sensor (5) and a pressure-relief valve or
pressure-control valve (2).

Operating concept
The pressurized fuel delivered by the high-
pressure pump passes via a high-pressure fuel
line to the fuel-rail inlet (4). From there, it is
distributed to the individual injectors (hence
the term “common rail”).

The fuel pressure is measured by the rail-
pressure sensor and controlled to the required
value by the pressure-control valve. The pres-
sure-relief valve is used as an alternative to
the pressure-control valve – depending on
system requirements – and its function is to
limit fuel pressure in the fuel rail to the maxi-
mum permissible pressure. The highly com-
pressed fuel is routed from the fuel rail to the
injectors via high-pressure delivery lines.

The cavity inside the fuel rail is permanently
filled with pressurized fuel. The compressibil-
ity of the fuel under high pressure is utilized
to achieve an accumulator effect. When fuel 
is released from the fuel rail for injection, the
pressure in the high-pressure accumulator 
remains virtually constant, even when large
quantities of fuel are released.

High-pressure sensors

Application
In automotive applications, high-pressure
sensors are used for measuring the pressures
of fuels and brake fluids. 

Diesel rail-pressure sensor 
In the diesel engine, the rail-pressure sensor
measures the pressure in the fuel rail of the
common-rail accumulator-type injection sys-
tem. Maximum operating (nominal) pressure
pmax is 160 MPa (1,600 bar). Fuel pressure is
controlled by a closed control loop, and re-
mains practically constant independent of
load and engine speed. Any deviations from
the setpoint pressure are compensated for by
a pressure-control valve.

Gasoline rail-pressure sensor
As its name implies, this sensor measures the
pressure in the fuel rail of the DI Motronic
with gasoline direct injection. Pressure is a
function of load and engine speed and is
5...12 MPa (50...120 bar), and is used as an
actual (measured) value in the closed-loop
rail-pressure control. The rpm and load-
 dependent setpoint value is stored in a map
and is adjusted at the rail by a pressure con-
trol valve.

Brake-fluid pressure sensor
Installed in the hydraulic modulator of 
such driving-safety systems as ESP, this 
high- pressure sensor is used to measure the
brake-fluid pressure which is usually 25 MPa
(250 bar). Maximum pressure pmax can climb
to as much as 35 MPa (350 bar).  Pressure
measurement and monitoring is triggered 
by the ECU which also evaluates the return
signals.

Design and operating concept
The heart of the sensor is a steel diaphragm
onto which deformation resistors have been
vapor-deposited in the form of a bridge  
 cir cuit (Fig. 1, 3). The sensor’s pres  sure-
measuring range depends on diaphragm
thickness (thicker diaphragms for higher

pressures and thinner ones for lower pres-
sures). When the pressure is applied via the
pressure connection (4) to one of the dia -
phragm faces, the resistances of the bridge re-
sistors change due to diaphragm deformation
(approx. 20 µm at 1,500 bar). 

The 0...80 mV output voltage generated by
the bridge is conducted to an evaluation cir-
cuit which amplifies it to 0...5 V. This is used
as the input to the ECU which refers to a
stored characteristic curve in calculating the
pressure (Fig. 2).

High-pressure components of common-rail system

Pressure-control valve

Pressure-control valve activated 
When the pressure in the high-pressure cir-
cuit needs to be increased, the force of the
electromagnet is added to that of the spring.
The pressure-control valve is activated and
closes until a state of equilibrium is reached
between the high pressure and the combined
force of the electromagnet and the spring. 
At this point, it remains in partly open posi-
tion and maintains a constant pressure.
 Variations in the delivery quantity of the
high-pressure pump and the withdrawal 
of fuel from the fuel rail by the injectors are
compensated by varying the valve aperture.
The magnetic force of the electromagnet 
is proportional to the control current. The
control current is varied by pulse-width mod-
ulation. A pulse frequency of 1 kHz is suffi-
ciently high to prevent adverse armature
movement or pressure fluctuations in the fuel
rail.

Designs 
The pressure-control valve DRV1 is used in
first-generation common-rail systems. Sec-
ond- and third-generation CR systems oper-
ate using the two-actuator concept. Here, the
rail pressure is adjusted by both a metering
unit as well as a pressure-control valve. In this

1

Pressure-control valve DRV1 (section)

Pressure-control valve

Function
The function of the pressure-control valve 
is to adjust and maintain the pressure in the
fuel rail as a factor of engine load, i.e.:
(cid:0) It opens when the rail pressure is too high.
Part of the fuel then returns from the fuel
rail via a common line to the fuel tank.
(cid:0) It closes when the rail pressure is too low,

thus sealing the high-pressure side from the
low-pressure side.

Design
The pressure-control valve (Fig. 1) has a
mounting flange which attaches it to the
high-pressure pump or the fuel rail. The
 armature (5) forces a valve ball (6) against the
valve seat in order to seal the high-pressure
stage from the low-pressure stage; this is
achieved by the combined action of a valve
spring (2) and an electromagnet (4) which
force the armature downwards.

Fuel flows around the whole of the arma-

ture for lubrication and cooling purposes.

Operating concept
The pressure-control valve has two closed
control loops:
(cid:0) A slower, closed electrical control loop for
setting a variable average pressure level in
the fuel rail.

(cid:0) A faster hydromechanical control loop for
balancing out high-frequency pressure
pulses.

Pressure-control valve not activated 
The high pressure present in the fuel rail or at
the high-pressure pump outlet is applied to
the pressure-control valve via the high-pres-
sure fuel supply. As the deengerized electro-
magnet exerts no force, the high-pressure
force is greater than the spring force. The
pressure-control valve opens to a greater or
lesser extent depending on the delivery quan-
tity. The spring is dimensioned to maintain a
pressure of approx. 100 bar.

Pressure-relief valve

Function
The pressure-relief valve has the same func-
tion as a pressure limiter. The latest version 
of the internal pressure-relief valve now has
an integrated limp-home function. The pres-
sure-relief valve limits pressure in the fuel rail
by releasing a drain hole when pressure ex-
ceeds a certain limit. The limp-home func-
tion ensures that a certain pressure is main-
tained in the fuel rail to permit the  vehicle to
continue running without any  restriction.

Design and operating concept
The pressure-relief valve (Fig. 3) is a mechan-
ical component. It consists of the  following
parts:
(cid:0) A housing with an external thread for

screwing to the fuel rail.

(cid:0) A connection to the fuel-return line 

to the fuel tank (3).
(cid:0) A movable plunger (2).
(cid:0) A plunger return spring (5).

At the end which is screwed to the fuel rail,
there is a hole in the valve housing which 
is sealed by the tapered end of the plunger
resting against the valve seat inside the valve
housing. At normal operating pressure, a
spring presses the plunger against the valve
seat so that the fuel rail remains sealed.  
Only if the pressure rises above the maximum
system pressure is the plunger forced back
against the action of the spring by the pres-
sure in the fuel rail so that the high-pressure
fuel can escape. The fuel is routed through
passages into a central bore of the plunger
and returned to the fuel tank via a common
line. As the valve opens, fuel can escape from
the fuel rail to produce a reduction in fuel-
rail pressure.

Injection nozzles 

Injection nozzles

The injection nozzle injects the fuel into the
combustion chamber of the diesel engine. It is
a determining factor in the efficiency of mix-
ture formation and combustion and, therefore
has a fundamental effect on engine perfor-
mance, exhaust-gas behavior, and noise. In or-
der that injection nozzles can perform their
function as effectively as possible, they have to
be designed to match the fuel-injection system
and engine in which they are used.

The injection nozzle is a central component 
of any fuel-injection system. It requires highly
specialized technical knowledge on the part of
its designers. The nozzle plays a major role in:
(cid:1) Shaping the rate-of-discharge curve (pre-

cise progression of pressure and fuel distri-
bution relative to crankshaft rotation)
(cid:1) Optimum atomization and distribution 
of fuel in the combustion chamber, and
(cid:1) Sealing off the fuel-injection system from

the combustion chamber

Due to its exposed position in the combustion
chamber, the nozzle is subjected to constant
pulsating mechanical and thermal stresses from
the engine and the fuel-injection system. The
fuel flowing through the nozzle must also cool
it. When the engine is overrunning, when no
fuel is being injected, the nozzle temperature in-
creases steeply. Therefore, it must have sufficient
high-temperature resistance to cope with these
conditions.

In fuel-injection systems based on in-line
 injection pumps (Type PE) and distributor
injection pumps (Type VE/VR), and in unit
pump (UP) systems, the nozzle is combined
with the nozzle holder to form the nozzle-
and-holder assembly (Fig. 1) and installed in
the engine. In high-pressure fuel-injection
systems, such as the Common Rail (CR) and
unit injector (UI) systems the nozzle is a
 single  integrated unit so that the nozzle
holder is not required.

Indirect-Injection (IDI) engines use pintle
nozzles, while direct-injection engines have
hole-type nozzles.

The nozzles are opened by the fuel pressure.
The nozzle opening, injection duration, and
rate-of-discharge curve (injection pattern) 
are the essential determinants of injected fuel
quantity. The nozzles must close rapid ly and re-
liably when the fuel pressure drops. The closing
pressure is at least 40 bar above the maximum
combustion pressure in order to prevent un-
wanted post-injection or intrusion of combus-
tion gases into the nozzle. The nozzle must be
designed specifically for the type of engine in
which it is used as determined by:
(cid:1) The injection method (direct or indirect)
(cid:1) The geometry of the combustion chamber
(cid:1) The required injection-jet shape and

(cid:1) The required penetration and atomization

 direction

of the fuel jet

(cid:1) The required injection duration, and
(cid:1) The required injected fuel quantity  relative

to crankshaft rotation

Standardized dimensions and combinations
provide the required degree of adaptability
combined with the minimum of component
diversity. Due to the superior performance
combined with lower fuel consumption that 
it offers, all new engine designs use direct injec-
tion (and therefore hole-type nozzles).

Dimensions of diesel fuel-injection technology

The world of diesel fuel injection is a world of
superlatives.

The valve needle of a commercial-vehicle noz-
zle will open and close the nozzle more than 
a billion times in the course of its service life. 
It provides a reliable seal at pressures as high
as 2,050 bar as well as having to withstand
many other stresses such as:
(cid:1) The shocks caused by rapid opening and

closing (on cars, this can take place as fre-
quently as 10,000 times a minute if there
are pre- and post-injection phases)

(cid:1) The high flow-related stresses during fuel

(cid:1) The pressure and temperature of the com-

 injection, and

bustion chamber

The facts and figures below illustrate what
modern nozzles are capable of:
(cid:1) The pressure in the fuel-injection chamber

can be as high as 2,050 bar. That is equiva-
lent to the pressure produced by the weight
of a large luxury sedan acting on an area
the size of a fingernail.

(cid:1) The injection duration is 1...2 milliseconds
(ms). In one millisecond, the sound wave
from a loudspeaker only travels about
33 cm.

(cid:1) The injection durations on a car engine vary
between 1 mm3 (pre-injection) and 50 mm3
(full-load delivery); on a commercial vehicle,
between 3 mm3 (pre-injection) and 350 mm3
(full-load delivery). 1 mm3 is equivalent to 
half the size of a pinhead. 350 mm3 is about
the same as 12 large raindrops (30 mm3 per
raindrop). That amount of fuel is forced at a
velocity of 2,000 km/h through an opening 
of less than 0.25 mm2 in the space of only
2 ms.

(cid:1) The valve-needle clearance is 0.002 mm 
(2 µm). A human hair is 30 times thicker
(0.06 mm).

Such high-precision technology demands 
an enormous amount of expertise in develop-
ment, materials, production, and measurement
techniques.

Inject ion nozzles

Pintle nozzles

Pintle nozzles

Usage
Pintle nozzles are used on Indirect Injection
(IDI) engines, i.e. engines that have precham-
bers or whirl chambers. In this type of engine,
the mixing of fuel and air is achieved primar-
ily by the whirl effects created inside the cylin-
der. The shape of the injection jet can also
assist the process. Pintle nozzles are not suit-
able for direct-injection engines as the peak
pressures inside the combustion chamber
would open the nozzle. The following types
of pintle nozzle are available:
(cid:0) Standard pintle nozzles
(cid:0) Throttling pintle nozzles and 
(cid:0) Flatted-pintle nozzles

Design and method of operation
The fundamental design of all pintle nozzles is
virtually identical. The differences between
them are to be found in the geometry of the
pintle (Fig. 1, 7). Inside the nozzle body is
the nozzle needle (3) It is pressed down-
wards by the force FF exerted by the spring
and the pressure pin in the nozzle holder so
that it seals off the nozzle from the combus-
tion chamber. As the pressure of the fuel in
the pressure chamber (5) increases, it acts on
the pressure shoulder (6) and forces the nozzle
needle upwards (force FD). The pintle lifts
away from the injector orifice (8) and opens
the way for fuel to pass through into the com-
bustion chamber (the nozzle “opens”; open-
ing pressure 110...170 bar). When the pres-
sure drops, the nozzle closes again. Opening
and closing of the nozzle is thus controlled
by the pressure inside the nozzle.

Design variations
Standard pintle nozzle
The nozzle needle of (Fig. 1, 3) of a standard
pintle nozzle has a pintle (7) that fits into
the injector orifice (8) of the nozzle with a
small degree of play. By varying the dimen-
sions and geometry of the of the pintle, the
characteristics of the injection jet produced
can be modified to suit the requirements of
different engines.

Throttling pintle nozzle
One of the variations of the pintle nozzle is the
throttling pintle nozzle. The profile of the pin-
tle allows a specific rate-of-discharge curve to
be produced. As the nozzle needle opens, at
first only a very narrow annular orifice is pro -
vided which allows only a small amount of fuel
to pass through (throttling effect).

As the pintle draws further back with in-

creasing fuel pressure, the size of the gap
through which fuel can flow increases. The
greater proportion of the injected fuel quan-
tity is only injected as the pintle approaches
the limit of its upward travel. By modifying
the rate-of-discharge curve in this way,“softer”
combustion is produced because the pressure
in the combustion chamber does not rise so
quickly. As a result, combustion noise is re-
duced in the part-load range. This means that
the shape of the pintle in combination with
the throttling gap and the characteristic of the
compression spring in the nozzle holder
produces the desired rate-of-discharge curve.

Flatted-pintle nozzle
The flatted-pintle nozzle (Fig. 3) has a pintle
with a flatted face on its tip which, as the nozzle
opens (at the beginning of needle lift travel)
produces a wider passage within the annular
orifice. This helps to prevent deposits at that
point by increasing the volumetric flow rate.As
a result, flatted-pintle nozzles “coke” to a lesser
degree and more evenly. The annular orifice
between the jet orifice and the pintle is very
narrow (< 10µm). The flatted face is frequently
parallel to the axis of the nozzle needle. By
setting the flatted face at an angle, the volu-
metric flow rate, Q, can be increased in the
flatter section of the rate-of-discharge curve
(Fig. 4). In this way, a smoother transition 
between the initial phase and the fully-open
phase of the rate-of-discharge curve can be
obtained. Specially designed variations in pintle
geometry allow the flow-rate pattern to be
modified to suit particular engine require-
ments. As a result, engine noise in the part-
load range is reduced and engine smoothness
improved.

Injection nozzles

Hole-type nozzles

Hole-type nozzles

Application
Hole-type nozzles are used on engines that
operate according to the Direct-Injection
process (DI). The position in which the
 nozzles are fitted is generally determined 
by the engine design. The injection orifices
are set at a variety of angles according to the
requirements of the combustion chamber
(Fig. 1). Hole-type nozzles are divided into:
(cid:3) Blind-hole nozzles
(cid:3) Sac-less (vco) nozzles

Hole-type nozzles are also divided according
to size into:
(cid:3) Type P which have a needle diameter of
4 mm (blind-hole and sac-less (vco)
 nozzles).

(cid:3) Type S which have a needle diameter of 
5 or 6 mm (blind-hole nozzles for large 
engines).

In Common-Rail (CR) and Unit Injector (UI)
fuel-injection systems, the hole-type nozzle is a
single integrated unit. It combines, therefore,
the functions of the nozzle holder.

The opening pressure of hole-type nozzles

is in the range 150...350 bar.

Design
The injection orifices (Fig. 2, 6) are located
on the sheath of the nozzle cone (7). The
number and diameter are dependent on:
(cid:3) The required injected fuel quantity
(cid:3) The shape of the combustion chamber
(cid:3) The air vortex (whirl) inside of the com-

bustion chamber

The diameter of the injection orifices is
slightly larger at the inner end than at the
outer end. This difference is defined by the
port taper factor. The leading edges of the in-
jection orifices may be rounded by using the
hydro-erosion (HE) process. This involves the
use of an HE fluid that contains abrasive par-
ticles which smooth off the edges at points
where high flow velocities occur (leading
edges of injection orifices). Hydro-erosion
can be used both on blind-hole and sac-less
(vco) nozzles. Its purpose is to:
(cid:3) optimize the flow-resistance coefficient
(cid:3) pre-empt erosion of edges caused by

 particles in the fuel, and/or
(cid:3) tighten flow-rate tolerances

Nozzles have to be carefully designed to
match the engine in which they are used.
Nozzle design plays a decisive role in the
 following:
(cid:3) Precise metering of injected fuel (injection
duration and injected fuel quantity relative
to degrees of crankshaft rotation).

(cid:3) Fuel conditioning (number of jets, spray

shape and atomization of fuel).

(cid:3) Fuel dispersal inside the combustion 

chamber.

(cid:3) Sealing the fuel-injection system against

the combustion chamber.

The pressure chamber (10) is formed by Elec-
trochemical Machining (ECM). An electrode,
through which an electrolyte solution is
passed, is introduced into the pre-bored noz-
zle body. Material is then removed from the
positively charged nozzle body (anodic disso-
lution).

Designs
Fuel in the volume below the nozzle-needle
seat evaporates after combustion. This pro-
duces a large part of the engine's hydrocar-
bon emissions. For this reason, it is important
to keep the dead volume, or “detrimental”
volume, as small as possible.

In addition, the geometry of the needle 
seat and the shape of the nozzle cone have 
a decisive influence on the opening and
 closing characteristics of the nozzle. This, 
in turn, affects the soot and NOx emissions
produced by the engine.

The consideration of these various factors,

in combination with the demands of the 
engine and the fuel-injection system, has 
resulted in a variety of nozzle designs.

There are two basic designs:
(cid:3) Blind-hole nozzles
(cid:3) Sac-less (vco) nozzles

Among the blind-hole nozzles, there are a
number of variants.

Blind-hole nozzle
The injection orifices in the blind-hole nozzle
(Fig. 2, 6) are arranged around a blind hole.

If the nozzle has a rounded tip, the injection

orifices are drilled either mechanically or by
electro-erosion, depending on the  design.
In blind-hole nozzles with a conical tip, 
the injection orifices are generally created by
electro-erosion.

Blind-hole nozzles may have a cylindrical
or conical blind hole of varying dimensions.

Blind-hole nozzles with a cylindrical blind hole
and rounded tip (Fig. 3), which consists of a
cylindrical and a hemispherical  section, offer
a large amount of scope with regard to the
number of holes, length of injection orifices,
and spray-hole cone angle. The nozzle cone is
hemispherical in shape, which – in combina-
tion with the shape of the blind hole – en-
sures that all the spray holes are of equal
length.

Injection nozzles

Hole-type nozzles

The blind-hole nozzle with a cylindrical blind
hole and conical tip (Fig. 4a) is only available
for spray-hole lengths of 0.6 mm. The conical
tip shape increases tip strength as a result of 
a greater wall thickness between the neck 
radius (3) and the nozzle body seat (4).

5 Conical blind hole

Blind-hole nozzles with conical blind holes and
conical tip (Fig. 4b) have a smaller dead vol-
ume than nozzles with a cylindrical blind
hole. The volume of the blind hole is between
that of a sac-less (vco) nozzle and a blind-
hole nozzle with a cylindrical blind hole. 
In order to obtain an even wall thickness
throughout the tip, it is shaped conically to
match the shape of the blind hole.

A further refinement of the blind-hole nozzle
is the micro-blind-hole nozzle (Fig. 4c). Its
blind-hole volume is around 30% smaller
than that of a conventional blind-hole nozzle.
This type of nozzle is particularly suited to
use in common-rail systems, which operate
with a relatively slow needle lift and, conse-
quently, a comparatively long nozzle-seat 
restriction. The micro-blind-hole nozzle 
currently represents the best compromise 
between minimizing dead volume and even
spray dispersal when the nozzle opens for
common-rail systems.

Sac-less (vco) nozzles
In order to minimize dead volume – and
therefore HC emissions – the injection orifice
exits from the nozzle-body seat face. When the
nozzle is closed, the nozzle needle more or less
covers the injection orifice so that there is no
direct connection between the blind hole and
the combustion chamber (Fig. 4d). The blind-
hole volume is considerably smaller than that
of a blind-hole  nozzle. Sac-less (vco) nozzles
have a significantly lower stress capacity than
blind-hole nozzles and can therefore only be
produced with a spray-hole length of 1 mm.
The nozzle tip has a conical shape. The injec-
tion orifices are generally produced by electro-
erosion.

Special spray-hole geometries, secondary 
needle guides, and complex needle-tip
geometries are used to further improve spray
dispersal, and consequently mixture forma-
tion, on both blind-hole and sac-less (vco)
nozzles.

Heat shield
The maximum temperature capacity of hole-
type nozzles is around 300°C (heat  resistance
of material). Thermal-protection sleeves are
available for operation in especially difficult
conditions, and there are even cooled nozzles
for large-scale engines.

Hole-type nozzles have up to six injection

orifices in passenger cars and up to ten in
commercial vehicles. The aim of future devel-
opment will be to further increase the num-
ber of injection orifices and to reduce their
bore size (< 0.12 mm) in order to  obtain even
finer dispersal of fuel.

5

Decisive areas of nozzle geometry

Effect on emissions
Nozzle geometry has a direct effect on the en-
gine’s exhaust-gas emission characteristics.
(cid:3) The spray-hole geometry (Fig. 5, 1) influ-
ences particulate and NOx emissions.
(cid:3) The needle-seat geometry (2) affects engine
noise due to its effect on the pilot volume,
i.e.the volume injected at the beginning of
the injection process. The aim of optimizing
spray-hole and seat geometry is to produce a
durable nozzle capable of mass production 
to very tight dimensional tolerances.

(cid:3) Blind-hole geometry (3) affects HC emis-
sions, as previously mentioned. The de-
signer can select and combine the various
nozzle characteristics to obtain the opti-
mum design for a particular engine and 
vehicle concerned.

For this reason, it is important that the noz-
zles are designed specifically for the vehicle,
engine and fuel-injection system in which
they are to be used. When servicing is re-
quired, it is equally important to use genuine
OEM parts in order to ensure that  engine
performance is not impaired and  exhaust-gas
emissions are not increased.

Spray shapes
Basically, the shape of the injection jet for car
engines is long and narrow because these en-
gines produce a large degree of whirl inside 
of the combustion chamber. There is no whirl
effect in commercial-vehicle engines. There-
fore, the injection jet tends to be wider and
shorter. Even where there is a large amount of
whirl, the individual injection jets must not
intermingle, otherwise fuel would be injected
into areas where combustion has already
taken place and, therefore, where there is a
lack of air. This would result in the produc-
tion of large amounts of soot.

Future development of the nozzle

Future development 
of the nozzle

In view of the rapid development of new,
high-performance engines and fuel-injection
systems with sophisticated functionality
(e.g. multiple injection phases), continuous
development of the nozzle is a necessity. 
In addition, there are number of aspects 
of nozzle design which offer scope for inno-
vation and further improvement of diesel 
engine performance in the future. The most
important aims are:
(cid:3) Minimize untreated emissions to reduce or
totally avoid the outlay for an expensive ex-
haust-gas treatment (e.g. particulate filter).

(cid:3) Minimize fuel consumption.
(cid:3) Optimize engine noise.

There various different areas on which atten-
tion can be focused in the future development
of the nozzle (Fig. 1) and a corresponding va-
riety of development tools (Fig. 2). New mate-
rials are also constantly being developed to 
offer improvements in durability. The use 
of multiple-injection phases also has conse-
quences for the design of the nozzle.

The use of other fuels (e.g. designer fuels)

affects nozzle shape due to differences in 
viscosity or flow response.

Such changes will, in some cases, also
 demand new production processes, such 
as laser drilling for the injection orifices.

High-precision technology

161

zle injection orifices are rounded off by special
abrasive fluids (hydro-erosion machining).

The minute tolerances demand the use of
highly specialized and ultra-accurate measur-
ing equipment such as:
(cid:3) Optical 3D coordinate measuring machine
for measuring the injection orifices, or
(cid:3) Laser interferometers for checking the

smoothness of the nozzle sealing faces.

The manufacture of diesel fuel-injection compo-
nents is thus “high-volume, high-technology”.

(cid:2)

A matter of high-precision

(cid:1)

High-precision technology

The image associated with diesel engines in
many people’s minds is more one of heavy-
duty machinery than high-precision engineer-
ing. But modern diesel fuel-injection systems
are made up of components that are manufac-
tured to the highest degrees of accuracy and
required to withstand enormous stresses.

The nozzle is the interface between the fuel-
 injection system and the engine. It has to open
and close precisely and reliably for the entire
life of the engine. When it is closed, it must
not leak. This would increase fuel consump-
tion, adversely affect exhaust-gas emissions,
and might even cause engine damage.

To ensure that the nozzles seal reliably at
the high pressures generated in modern fuel-
injection systems such as the VR (VP44), CR,
UPS and UIS designs (up to 2,050 bar), they
have to be specially designed and very pre-
cisely manufactured. By way of illustration,
here are some examples:
(cid:3) To ensure that the sealing face of the nozzle
body (1) provides a reliable seal, its has a
dimensional tolerance of 0.001 mm (1 µm).
That means it must be accurate to within
approximately 4,000 metal atom layers!
(cid:3) The nozzle-needle guide clearance (2) is
0.002...0.004 mm (2...4 µm). The dimen-
sional tolerances are similarly less than
0.001 mm (1 µm).

The injection orifices (3) in the nozzles are cre-
ated by an electro-erosion machining process.
This process erodes the metal by vaporization
caused by the high temperature generated 
by the spark discharge between an electrode
and the workpiece. Using high-precision elec-
trodes and accurately configured parameters,
extremely precise injection orifices with diame-
ters of 0.12 mm can be produced. This means
that the smallest injection orifice diameter is
only twice the thickness of a human hair 
(0.06 mm). In order to obtain better injection
characteristics, the leading edges of the noz-

Nozzle holders

A nozzle holder combines with the matching
nozzle to form the nozzle-and-holder assem-
bly. There is a nozzle-and-holder assembly
 fitted in the cylinder head for each engine
cylinder (Fig. 1). These components form an
important part of the fuel-injection system and
help to shape engine performance, exhaust
emissions and noise characteristics. 
In order that they are able to perform their
function properly, they must be designed to
suit the engine in which they are used.

The nozzle (4) in the nozzle holder sprays
fuel into the diesel-engine combustion 
chamber (6). The nozzle holder contains 
the following essential components:
(cid:0) Valve spring(s) (9) 

which act(s) against the nozzle needle 
so as to close the nozzle
(cid:0) Nozzle-retaining nut (8) 

which retains and centers the nozzle

(cid:0) Filter (11)

(cid:0) Connections for the fuel supply and return
lines which are linked via the pressure

The design of the nozzle holder for direct-in-
jection (DI) and indirect-injection (IDI) en-
gines is basically the same. But since modern
diesel engines are almost exclusively direct-in-
jection, the nozzle-and-holder assemblies ill -
ustrated here are mainly for DI engines. The
descriptions, however, can be applied to IDI
nozzles as well, but bearing in mind that the
latter use pintle nozzles rather than the hole-
type nozzles found in DI engines.

Nozzle holders can be combined with a range
of nozzles. In addition, depending on the re-
quired injection pattern, there is a choice of
(cid:0) standard nozzle holder (single-spring  nozzle

(cid:0) two-spring nozzle holder (not for unit pump

holder) or

systems).

A variation of those designs is the stepped
holder which is particularly suited to situa-
tions where space is limited.

Depending on the fuel-injection system in
which they are used, nozzle holders may or 
may not be fitted with needle-motion sensors. 

3

Examples of nozzle-and-holder assemblies

The needle-motion sensor signals the precise
start of injection to the engine control unit.
Nozzle holders may be attached to the
cylinder block by flanges, clamps, sleeve nuts
or external threads. The fuel-line connection
is in the center or at the side.

The fuel that leaks past the nozzle needle
acts as lubrication. In many nozzle-holder 
designs, it is returned to the fuel tank by 
a fuel-return line.

Some nozzle holders function without fuel

leakage – i.e. without a fuel-return line. The
fuel in the spring chamber has a damping 
effect on the needle stroke at high injection
volumes and engine speeds so that a similar
injection pattern to that of a two-spring 
nozzle holder is generated.

In the common-rail and unit-injector high-
pressure fuel-injection systems, the nozzle 
is integral with the injector, so that a nozzle-
and-holder assembly is unnecessary.

For large-scale engines with a per-cylinder
output of more than 75 kW, there are applica-
tion-specific fuel-injector assemblies which
may also be cooled.

Standard nozzle holders

Design and usage
The key features of standard nozzle holders
are as follows:
(cid:0) Cylindrical exterior with diameters of 17,

21, 25 and 26 mm

(cid:0) Non-twist hole-type nozzles for engines

with direct injection and

(cid:0) Standardized individual components

(springs, pressure pins, nozzle retaining
nuts) that permit different combinations

The nozzle-and-holder assembly is made up
of nozzle holder and nozzle (Fig. 1, with hole-
type nozzle). The nozzle holder consists of the
following components:
(cid:0) Holder body (3)
(cid:0) Intermediate disk (5)
(cid:0) Nozzle-retaining nut (4)
(cid:0) Pressure pin (18)
(cid:0) Compression spring (17)
(cid:0) Shim (15) and
(cid:0) Locating pin (20)

The nozzle is attached centrally to the holder
by the nozzle-retaining nut. When the retain-
ing nut and holder body are screwed together,
the intermediate disk is pressed against the
sealing faces of the holder and nozzle body.
The intermediate disk acts as a limiting stop
for the needle lift and also centers the nozzle
relative to the nozzle holder by means of the
locating pins.

The pressure pin centers the compression
spring and is guided by the nozzle-needle
pressure pin (19).

The pressure passage (16) inside the nozzle
holder body connects through the channel in
the intermediate disk to the inlet passage of
the nozzle, thus connecting the nozzle to the
high-pressure line of the fuel-injection pump.
If required, an edge-type filter (12) may be
fitted inside the nozzle holder. This keeps out
any dirt that may be contained in the fuel.

Method of operation
The compression spring inside the nozzle
holder acts on the nozzle needle via the pres-
sure pin. The spring tension is set by means 
of a shim. The force of the spring thus deter-
mines the opening pressure of the nozzle.

The fuel passes through the edge-type filter
(12) to the pressure passage (16) in the holder
body (3), through the intermediate disk (5)
and finally through the nozzle body (6) to the
space (8) surrounding the nozzle needle.
During the injection process, the nozzle needle
(7) is lifted upwards by the pressure of the 
fuel (110...170 bar for pintle nozzles and
150...350 bar for hole-type nozzles). The fuel
passes through the injection orifices (9) into
the combustion chamber. The injection process
comes to an end when the fuel pressure drops
to a point where the compression spring (17)
is able to push the nozzle needle back against
its seat. Start of injection is thus controlled 
by fuel pressure. The injected fuel quantity
depends essentially on how long the nozzle
remains open.

Stepped nozzle holders

Design and usage
On multi-valve commercial-vehicle engines 
in particular, where the nozzle-and-holder 
assembly has to be fitted vertically because of
space constraints, stepped nozzle-and-holder
assemblies are used (Fig. 3). The reason for the
name can be found in the graduated dimen-
sions (1).

The design and method of operation are the
same as for standard nozzle holders. The es-
sential difference lies in the way in which the
fuel line is connected. Whereas on a standard
nozzle holder it is screwed centrally to the top
end of the nozzle holder, on a stepped holder
it is connected to the holder body (11) by
means of a delivery connection (10). This
type of arrangement is normally used to
achieve very short injection fuel lines, and has
a beneficial effect on the injection pressure
because of the smaller dead volume in the
fuel lines.

Two-spring injector assembly

Two-spring nozzle holders

Usage
The two-spring nozzle holder is a refinement
of the standard nozzle holder. It has the same
external dimensions. Its graduated rate-of-
discharge curve (Fig. 2) produces “softer”
combustion and therefore a quieter engine,
particularly at idle speed and part load. It is
used primarily on direct-injection (DI) engines.

Design and method of operation
The two-spring nozzle holder (Fig. 1) has two
compression springs positioned one behind
the other. Initially, only one of the compres-
sion springs (3) is acting on the nozzle needle
(13) and thus determines the opening pres-
sure. The second compression spring (6) rests
against a stop sleeve (10) which limits the
plunger lift to port closing. During the injec-
tion process, the nozzle needle initially moves
towards the plunger lift to port closing, h1
(0.03...0.06 mm for DI engines, 0.1 mm for
IDI engines). This allows only a small amount
of fuel into the combustion chamber.

As the pressure inside the nozzle holder
continues to increase, the stop sleeve over-
comes the force of both compression springs
(3 and 6). The nozzle needle then completes
the main lift (h1 + h2, 0.2...0.4 mm) so that
the main injected fuel quantity is injected.

Nozzle holders with  
needle-motion sensors

Usage
Start of delivery is a key variable for optimiz-
ing diesel-engine performance. Detection of
this variable allows the adjustment of start of
delivery according to engine load and speed
within a closed control loop. In systems with
distributor and in-line fuel-injection pumps,
this is achieved by means of a nozzle with 
a needle-motion sensor (Fig. 2) which trans-
mits a signal when the nozzle needle starts to
move upwards. It is sometimes also called a
needle-motion sensor. 

Design and method of operation
A current of approximately 30 mA is passed
through the detector coil (Fig. 2, 11). This
produces a magnetic field. The extended pres-
sure pin (12) slides inside the guide pin (9).
The penetration depth X determines the mag-
netic flux in the detector coil. By virtue of the
change in magnetic flux in the coil, movement
of the nozzle needle induces a velocity-depen-
dent voltage signal (Fig. 1) in the coil which is
processed by an analyzer circuit in the elec-
tronic control unit. When the signal level 
exceeds a threshold voltage, it is interpreted
by the analyzer circuit to indicate the start of
injection.

High-pressure lines

High-pressure connection fittings

High-pressure lines

Regardless of the basic system concept – in-
line fuel-injection pump, distributor injection
pump or unit pump systems – it is the high-
pressure delivery lines and their connection
fittings that furnish the links between the
fuel-injection pump(s) and the nozzle-and-
holder assemblies at the individual cylin-
ders. In common-rail systems, they serve as
the connection between the high-pressure
pump and the rail as well as between rail
and nozzles. No high-pressure delivery lines
are required in the unit-injector system.

High-pressure connection
 fittings

The high-pressure connection fittings must
supply secure sealing against leakage from
fuel under the maximum primary pressure.
The following types of fittings are used:
(cid:1) Sealing cone and union nut
(cid:1) Heavy-duty insert fittings, and
(cid:1) Perpendicular connection fittings

Sealing cone with union nut
All of the fuel-injection systems described
above use sealing cones with union nuts
(Fig. 1). The advantages of this connection
layout are:
(cid:1) Easy adaptation to individual fuel-injection

systems

(cid:1) Fitting can be disconnected and reconnected

(cid:1) The sealing cone can be shaped from the

numerous times

base material

At the end of the high-pressure line is the
compressed pipe-sealing cone (3). The union
nut (2) presses the cone into the high-pres-
sure connection fitting (4) to form a seal.
Some versions are equipped with a supple-
mentary thrust washer (1). This provides a
more consistent distribution of forces from
the union nut to the sealing cone. The cone’s
open diameter should not be restricted, as
this would obstruct fuel flow. Compressed
sealing cones are generally manufactured in
conformity with DIN 73 365 (Fig. 2).

Heavy-duty insert fittings
Heavy-duty insert fittings (Fig. 3) are used
in unit-pump and common-rail systems as
installed in heavy-duty commercial vehicles.
With the insert fitting, it is not necessary to
route the fuel line around the cylinder head
to bring it to the nozzle holder or nozzle.
This allows shorter fuel lines with associated
benefits when it comes to space savings and
ease of assembly.

The screw connection (8) presses the line in-
sert (3) directly into the nozzle holder (1) or
nozzle. The assembly also includes a mainte-

other end, the line is attached to the high-
pressure delivery line (7) with a sealing cone
and union nut (6).

Perpendicular connection fittings
Perpendicular connection fittings (Fig. 4) are
used in some passenger-car applications.
They are suitable for installations in which
there are severe space constraints. The fitting
contains passages for fuel inlet and return (7,
9). A bolt (1) presses the perpendicular fitting
onto the nozzle holder (5) to form a sealed
connection.

Sample or a high-pressure fitting

High-pressure delivery lines

The high-pressure fuel lines must withstand
the system’s maximum pressure as well as
pressure variations that can attain very high
fluctuations. The lines are seamless precision-
made steel tubing in killed cast steel which
has a particularly consistent microstructure.
Dimensions vary according to pump size
(Table 1, next page).

All high-pressure delivery lines are routed
to avoid sharp bends. The bend radius should
not be less than 50 mm.

High-pressure lines

High-pressure delivery lines

Length, diameter and wall depth of the high-
pressure lines all affect the injection process.
To cite some examples: Line length influences
the rate of discharge dependent on speed,
while internal diameter is related to throttling
loss and compression effects, which will be
reflected in the injected-fuel quantity. These
considerations lead to prescribed line dimen-
sions that must be strictly observed. Tubing
of other dimensions should never be installed
during service and repairs. Defective high-
pressure tubing should always be replaced by
OEM lines. During servicing or maintenance,
it is also important to observe precautions
against fouling entering the system. This ap-
plies in any case to all service work on fuel-
injection systems.

A general priority in the development of
fuel-injection systems is to minimize the length
of high-pressure lines. Shorter lines produce
better injection-system performance.

Injection is accompanied by the formation 
of pressure waves. These are pulses that prop-
agate at the speed of sound before finally 
being reflected on impact at the ends. This
phenomenon increases in intensity as engine
speed rises. Engineers exploit it to raise 
injection pressure. The engineering process
entails defining line lengths that are precisely
matched to the engine and the fuel-injection
system.

All cylinders are fed by high-pressure delivery
lines of a single, uniform length. More or less
angled bends in the lines compensate for the
different distances between the outlets from
the fuel-injection pump or rail, and the indi-
vidual engine cylinders.

The primary factor determining the high-
pressure line’s compression-pulsating fatigue
strength is the surface quality of the inner
walls of the lines, as defined by material and
peak-to-valley height. Especially demanding
performance requirements are satisfied by
prestressed high-pressure delivery lines (for
applications of 1,400 bar and over). Before
installation on the engine, these customized
lines are subjected to extremely high pressures
(up to 3,800 bar). Then pressure is suddenly
relieved. The process compresses the material
on the inner walls of the lines to provide
 increased internal strength.

The high-pressure delivery lines for vehicle
engines are normally mounted with clamp
brackets located at specific intervals. This
means that transfer of external vibration to
the lines is either minimal or nonexistent.
The dimensions of high-pressure lines 
for test benches are subject to more precise
tolerance specifications.

Attempts to deal with cavitation problems by
improving material quality and surface-harden-
ing processes cannot produce anything other
than very modest gains. The ultimate objective
is and remains to prevent the vapor bubbles
from forming, and, should complete prevention
prove impossible, to improve flow behavior to
limit the negative impacts of the bubbles.

Cavitation in the high-pressure system

Cavitation can damage fuel-injection systems
(Fig. 1). The process takes place as follows:

Local pressure variations occur at restrictions

and in bends when a fluid enters an enclosed
area at extremely high speeds (for instance, in a
pump housing or in a high-pressure line). If 
the flow characteristics are less than optimum,
low-pressure sectors can form at these loca-
tions for limited periods of time, in turn pro-
moting the formation of vapor bubbles.

These gas bubbles implode in the subsequent
high-pressure phase. If a wall is located imme -
diately adjacent to the affected sector, the con-
centrated high energy can create a cavity in
the surface over time (erosion effect). This is
called cavitation damage.

As the vapor bubbles are transported by the
fluid’s flow, cavitation damage will not neces-
sarily occur at the location where the bubble
forms. Indeed, cavitation damage is frequently
found in eddy zones.

The causes behind these temporary localized
low-pressure areas are numerous and varied.
Typical factors include:

Overview

Start-assist systems

The colder the diesel engine, the more reluc-
tant it is to start. Leakage and thermal losses
reduce the compression pressure in the cold
cylinders and with it the temperature of the
compressed air. Cold engines have an out-
side-temperature limit, under which starting
without the assistance of auxiliary start-
assist devices is no longer possible. 

Compared with gasoline, diesel fuel is very
easily combustible. That is why warm pre-
combustion-chamber and whirl-chamber
diesel engines and direct-injection (DI) en-
gines will start spontaneously at low outside
temperatures down to ≥ 0°C. Here, the spon-
taneous ignition temperature for diesel fuel of
250°C is achieved with the engine turning at
starting speed. Cold precombustion-chamber
and whirl-chamber diesel engines require
start assistance at ambient temperatures of
< 40°C and < 20°C respectively, while DI en-
gines only need such intervention  below 0°C.

Components of a preheating system

Overview

Systems for passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles
Preheating systems are used for passenger cars
and light commercial vehicles. These systems
increase starting comfort and help the engine
to run smoothly and with  minimal emissions
after starting and in the warm-up period. 

Preheating systems consist of sheathed-
 element glow plugs, a switch a preheating
software in the engine-management system.
Conventional preheating systems use glow
plugs with a nominal voltage of 11 V which
are activated by the vehicle system voltage.
New low-voltage preheating systems require
glow plugs with nominal voltages below 11 V
whose heat output is adapted to the  engine’s
requirements by an electronic glow control
unit. 

In precombustion-chamber and whirl-cham-
ber diesel engines (IDI), the glow plug extends
into the secondary combustion chamber, while
in DI engines, it extends into the main combus-
tion chamber of the engine cylinder.

Overview, preheating systems

173

The air/fuel mixture is directed past the hot
tip of the glow plug and heated. The ignition
temperature is reached in combination with
the heating of the intake air during the com-
pression cycle. 

Preheating systems are usually replaced by
flame starting systems in diesel engines with 
a displacement of more than 1 l/cylinder
(commercial vehicles).

Requirements
The more exacting comfort requirements of
today’s diesel drivers have decisively shaped
the development of modern preheating sys-
tems. Nowadays, drivers will no longer accept
a cold start together with the “diesel minute’s
silence”.

More stringent emission limits and the de-
sire for higher specific engine power have re-
sulted in the development of low-compres-
sion engines. The cold-starting and cold-run-
ning performance of these engines is prob-
lematic, but this can be controlled by higher
preheating temperatures and longer preheat-
ing times.

Due to the dramatic increase in the number
of electrical loads/consumers, low power con-
sumption by electrical components will be-
come increasingly important in the future. 

To summarize, a preheating system meet

(cid:0) Fastest possible preheating rate (1,000°C/s)

phases.

release. 

(cid:0) The glow plugs are subjected to intermedi-
ate heating after engine cooling by over-
running or to support particulate-filter 
regeneration.

Conventional preheating system
Design and construction
Conventional preheating systems consist of
(cid:0) a metal glow plug with a nominal voltage

of 11 V

(cid:0) a relay glow control unit and
(cid:0) a software module for the preheating func-
tion integrated in the engine control unit
(Electronic Diesel Control, EDC)

Method of operation
The preheating software in EDC starts and
ends the preheating process in accordance
with operation of the glow-plug starter
switch and parameters stored in the software.
The glow control unit activates the glow plugs
with vehicle system voltage via a relay during
the preheating, standby, start and post-heat-
ing phases. The nominal voltage of the glow
plugs is 11 V. The heating output is therefore
dependent on the current vehicle system 
voltage and the glow-plug thermistor (PTC).
The glow plug thus has a self-regulating func-
tion. In conjunction with an engine-load-
dependent cutout function in the engine-
management preheating software, it is possi-
ble to safely prevent the glow plug from suf-
fering temperature overload. Adaptation of
the post-heating time to the engine require-
ments extends the glow plug’s service life and
enhances its cold-running properties.

174

Start-assist systems

Preheating systems

The heating filament is welded into the cap 
of the element sheath for grounding. The
control filament is contacted at the terminal
stud, which establishes the connection to the
vehicle electrical system.

Function
When voltage is applied to the glow plug,
most of the electrical energy of the heating
filament is initially converted into heat; 
the temperature at the tip of the glow plug 
increases sharply. The temperature of the
control filament – and with it also the imped-
ance – increase with a time delay. The current 
draw and thus the total heating output of 
the glow plug decrease and the temperature
approaches a steady-state condition. The
heating characteristics shown in Figure 2 
are produced.

Temperatures of glow plugs of conventional
 preheating systems as a function of time

Duraterm sheathed-element glow plug
Design and properties 
The glow element consists of a tubular heat-
ing element which is sealed inside the gas-
tight plug body (Fig. 1, 3). The tubular heat-
ing element consists of a hot-gas and corro-
sion-resistant element sheath (4) which en-
closes a filament surrounded by compressed
magnesium oxide powder (6). That filament
is made up of two resistors connected in
 series – the heating filament (7) located in the
tip of the sheath, and the control filament (5).
Whereas the heating filament has an elec-
trical impedance that is independent of tem-
perature, the control filament has a positive
temperature coefficient (PTC). In the latest
generation of glow plugs (Type GSK2), its
impedance increases even more steeply as the
temperature rises than with the older  designs
(Type S-RSK). The Type GSK2 glow plugs are
thus faster at reaching the temperature re-
quired for igniting the diesel fuel (850°C in
4 s) and also have a lower steady-state tem-
perature. This means that the temperature is
kept below the critical level for the glow plug.
Consequently, it can remain in operation for
up to three minutes after the engine has
started. This post-heating function results in
a more effective engine cold-idle phase with
substantially lower noise and emission out-
put.

Map-controlled activation reliably prevents
thermal overloading of the glow plug in all
engine operating states.

The heating function implemented in EDC
contains an overheating-protection  facility in
the event of repeat heating. This is brought
about by an energy integration model. Dur-
ing heating, the energy introduced into the
glow plug is integrated. After deactivation, 
the amount of energy dissipated from the
glow plug by radiation and heat discharge is
subtracted from this amount of energy. This
enables the current temperature of the glow
plug to be estimated. If the temperature 
drops below a threshold stored in EDC, the
glow plug can be heated up again with push
voltage.

The heating temperature which can be
 adjusted as a function of the coolant temper-
ature prolongs the service life of the glow
plug while maintaining its excellent cold-
starting and cold-running properties. This is
achieved by lowering the glow-plug tempera-
ture when the coolant is “hot” – e.g. in TDI
engines from approx. –10°C – and shortening
the post-heating time. The application of the
preheating system can therefore be matched
to the requirements of the vehicle manufac-
turer.

These preheating systems facilitate a rapid
start when HighSpeed metal glow plugs are
used and an immediate start when Rapiterm
glow plugs are used similar to a gasoline 
engine up to –28°C.

GSK2 HighSpeed and GSK3

Low-voltage preheating system
Design and construction 
Depending on the application, the low-volt-
age preheating system contains 
(cid:0) ceramic Rapiterm sheathed-element glow
plugs or HighSpeed metal sheathed-ele-
ment glow plugs of low-voltage configura-
tion < 11 V,

(cid:0) an electronic glow control unit, and 
(cid:0) a software module for the preheating func-
tion integrated in the engine control unit
(Electronic Diesel Control, EDC).

Operating concept
The glow control unit activates the glow plugs
in such a way that the heating temperature is
adapted to the engine requirements in the
preheating, standby, start, post-heating and
intermediate-heating phases. In order during
preheating to achieve as quickly as possible
the heating temperature required for engine
starting, the glow plugs are briefly operated in
this phase with push voltage, which is above
the glow-plug nominal voltage. The activating
voltage is then reduced to the glow-plug
nominal voltage during start-standby heating. 
During glow-plug start assist, the activa-

tion voltage is increased again in order to
compensate for the cooling of the glow plug
by the cold intake air. This is also possible in
the post- and intermediate-heating phases.
The required voltage is generated from the
vehicle system voltage by Pulse-Width Modu-
lation (PWM). Here, the associated PWM
value is taken from a program map, which is
adapted to the relevant engine within an ap-
plication. The program map is stored in the
preheating module of the EDC software and
contains the following parameters:
(cid:0) Speed
(cid:0) Injected fuel quantity (i.e., load)
(cid:0) Time after starter release (currently three
post-heating phases are defined, within
which the temperature of the glow plug can
be adapted)

HighSpeed metal sheathed-element
glow plug
Figure 4 shows a HighSpeed metal sheathed-
element glow plug with a nominal voltage of
4.4 V (push voltage of 11 V when heating for
1.8 s, then reduction to nominal voltage) with
an M8 body.

The basic design and operation of the
HighSpeed glow plug is the same as that of
the Duraterm. The heating and control fila-
ments are designed here for a lower nominal
voltage and a high preheating rate.

The slender shape is designed to suit the re-
stricted space in four-valve engines. The glow
element (dia. 4/3.3 mm) is tapered at the
front in order to accommodate the heating
filament closer to the element sheath. This 
allows preheating rates of up to 1,000°C/3 s
with the push mode used here. The maxi-
mum heating temperature is in  excess of
1,000°C. The temperature during start-
standby heating and in post-heating mode is
approx. 980°C. These functional properties
are adapted to the requirements of diesel 
engines with a compression ratio of ε ≥ 18.

Rapiterm sheathed-element glow plug
Rapiterm sheathed-element glow plugs
(Fig. 5) have glow elements made from a new,
high-temperature-resistant, ceramic compos-
ite material with adjustable electric conduc-
tivity. On account of their very high  oxidation

stability and thermal-shock resistance, they
allow an immediate start, maximum heating
temperatures of 1,300°C, and post- and inter-
mediate heating lasting minutes at 1,150°C.
Their low power consumption and long ser-
vice life make them superior to other
sheathed-element glow plugs.

Reduced emissions in diesel engines
with a low compression ratio
By lowering the compression ratio in modern
diesel engines from ε = 18 to ε = 16, it is pos-
sible to reduce the NOX and soot emissions
while simultaneously increasing the specific
power. However, the cold-starting and cold-
running performance is problematic in these
engines. In order to obtain minimal exhaust-
gas opacity values and heightened smooth
running during cold starting and cold run-

EDC-controlled relay glow control unit for
11 V glow plugs
The glow control unit activates the 11 V glow
plugs with vehicle system voltage via a relay
in accordance with the EDC specifications.
The heating output of the preheating system
is therefore dependent on the current vehicle
system voltage and the glow-plug thermistor
(PTC characteristic). Preheating systems with
relay glow control units are characterized by
low application expenditure. Malfunctioning
glow plugs or relay faults are detected and 
signaled to EDC by diagnostic flag.

EDC-controlled transistor glow control unit
for low-voltage glow plugs
The new electronic glow control units allow
specific voltage control of the low-voltage
glow plugs. The required effective voltage is
generated from the vehicle system voltage by
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM). Here, the
associated PWM value is taken from an en-
gine-specific program map which is stored in
the preheating module of the EDC software.
In this way, the heating output of the preheat-
ing system can be perfectly adapted to the 
engine requirements. Staggered activation of
the glow plugs reduces the maximum load on
the vehicle electrical system during the cold-
starting and post-heating phases to a mini-
mum.

The glow control unit incorporates self-di-
agnosis and glow-plug monitoring facilities.
Faults occurring in the preheating system are
reported to and stored in the EDC ECU. This
facilitates On-Board Diagnosis in accordance
with OBD II (USA) and EOBD (Europe). The
error codes stored in EDC enable the service
personnel to identify quickly and clearly the
failure cause – a glow plug, the glow control
unit or the main fuse.

ning, temperatures at the glow plug of over
1,150°C are required – 850°C is sufficient for
conventional engines. During the cold-start-
ing phase, these low emission values – blue-
smoke and soot emissions – can only be
maintained by post-heating lasting several
minutes. Compared with standard preheating
systems, the Rapiterm preheating system
from Bosch reduces the exhaust-gas opacity
values by up to 60%.

Glow control unit
The glow control unit controls the glow plugs
via a power relay or power transistors. It re-
ceives its starting signal from the engine man-
agement module or a temperature  sensor.
Autarkic glow control units assume all 
the control and display functions. The pre-
heating process is controlled by temperature
sensors in these systems. If the injected fuel
quantity exceeds a critical level, a load switch
interrupts the post-heating process. This pre-
vents the glow plugs from overheating. These
systems have in the meantime been super-
seded by EDC-controlled glow control units.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

When the air/fuel mixture is burned, the
main byproducts include pollutants such 
as NOx, soot, CO, and HC. The amount of
these pollutants contained in the untreated
exhaust gas (exhaust gas after combustion
before exhaust-gas treatment) mainly de-
pends on engine operating conditions. Be-
sides combustion-chamber shape and air-
flow path (supercharging/turbocharging, ex-
haust-gas recirculation, whirl control), the
fuel-injection system plays a key role 
in minimizing emissions.

The introduction of new emission standards
in Europe (Euro 3 since the year 2000) has
placed much more stringent requirements on
combustion processes in passenger-car diesel
engines. To obtain the best tradeoff between
conflicting factors, such as NOx emissions
and low combustion noise, pre-injection and
main injection must occur 
at precisely the right time and in the exact
quantities. This can only be achieved by elec-
tronic control of fuel-injection systems. Elec-
tronic Diesel Control (EDC) allows enhanced
fuel-delivery control, more precise adjust-
ment of start of injection, optimized combus-

tion processes dependent on the  operating
point, reduced fuel consumption, and lower
pollutant emissions.

In future more severe standards and greater
customer demands related to convenience
and drivability will only be achievable for
diesel engines through the use of modern
fuel-injection systems, such as the Unit
 Injector System/Unit Pump System, or
 common rail.

It will no longer be possible to meet

 continuing reductions in emission limits by
making internal modifications to the engine
alone. There will also be a need for additional
exhaust-gas treatment methods. 
By the time Euro 5 is introduced in Europe, it
will be absolutely necessary to fit a particulate
filter to comply with the very low particulate
limits.

New, even more flexible high-pressure fuel-
injection systems are under development to
comply with the ultra-low U.S. NOx limits of
Tier 2 (valid since 2004) in order to dispense
with complex systems required to extract
NOx from the exhaust gas.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Combustion process

179

Combustion process

The combustion process and its adjustment
play a key role in the diesel engine when it
comes to achievable performance, fuel con-
sumption, and emissions.

Engine performance is limited by the
black-smoke emission value (maximum
 permitted exhaust-gas opacity at full load)
and the maximum permitted exhaust-gas
temperature. The material properties of the
exhaust-gas turbocharger define the limit
value of the exhaust-gas temperature at the
turbine inlet.

Combustion in the diesel engine can be
 divided into three phases:
(cid:1) Ignition lag, i.e. the time between start 

of injection and start of ignition

(cid:1) Premixed combustion
(cid:1) Diffusion flame (mixture-controlled

 combustion)

Ignition lag, and thus a small quantity of in-
jected fuel, is required during the first phase
to limit combustion noise. After combustion
starts, a good mixture formation is needed to
achieve low soot and NOx emissions.

The following factors have a decisive influ-
ence on the combustion phases:
(cid:1) Pressure and temperature states within the

combustion chamber 

(cid:1) Mass, composition, and movement of 

the charge 

(cid:1) Injection pressure process

These parameters are adjustable firstly by en-
gine-specific parameters, and secondly 
by variable operating parameters.

The following fixed, engine-specific para-
meters are important for a given cylinder dis-
placement:
(cid:1) Compression ratio 
(cid:1) Stroke/bore ratio 
(cid:1) Shape of piston recess 
(cid:1) Intake port geometry 
(cid:1) Intake and exhaust valve timing

The fuel-injection system plays a key role in
the combustion process since it defines the
point of 50% mass fraction burnt and mix-
ture formation by determining the injection
point and rate-of-discharge curve. In turn,
the last two parameters are key factors con-
trolling emissions and efficiency.

Besides the fuel-injection system, develop-
ment focus is increasing on the air-flow sys-
tem since compliance with ever more strin-
gent NOx emission limits requires very high
exhaust-gas recirculation rates.

Fig. 2 (on the next page) shows the main
 engine-specific and operation-dependent in-
fluencing variables that affect the combustion
process.

Fuel-injection system
On the air-intake side, mixture formation 
is influenced by movement of the charge in-
side of the cylinder. This, in turn, depends on
intake-duct geometry and combustion-cham-
ber shape. As injection pressures have risen,
the function of mixture formation has gradu-
ally shifted to the fuel-injection system. As a
result, this has led to the development of the
low-whirl combustion process.

On the fuel-injection side, extremely small
nozzle holes with flow-optimized geometries
promote good mixture formation as the in-
jected fuel is then well prepared. At the same
time this shortens ignition lag, and only small
quantities of fuel are injected. During diffu-
sion combustion that follows, optimized at-
omization results in high EGR compatibility,
and this produces less NOx and soot.

Air-flow system
Besides the fuel-injection system, more
 attention is also focusing on the air-flow
 system, since compliance with ever more
stringent NOx emission limits requires very
high EGR compatibility of the combustion
process. This minimizes the formation of
NOx so that the particulate filter (now fitted
in ever greater numbers) can cope with the
quantity of particulate emissions produced. 

180

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Combustion process

It requires a system that is capable of combin-
ing comparatively high charge-air pressures at
high, precise EGR rates identical for all cylin-
ders, and at the lowest possible intake tem-
peratures.

Cylinder charge
Other measures carried out on the engine
have an impact on cylinder charge from pe-
ripheral systems, and ultimately on the con-
centration of pollutants in the exhaust gas.

The most important measure for minimizing
pollutants here is exhaust-gas recirculation.
Exhaust gas recirculated to the intake mani-
fold raises the proportion of inert gas, thus
causing a drop in peak combustion tempera-
ture. It also reduces the production of nitro-
gen oxides (see the section on  “Exhaust-gas
recirculation”).

Exhaust-gas turbocharging
Although turbocharging is primarily in-
tended to increase specific performance, 
it also increases EGR compatibility in the
program map by producing a greater charge
mass in the combustion chamber. This makes
for a more favorable NOx/soot tradeoff. It
also makes Variable-Turbine-Geometry
(VTG) turbochargers indispensable since
they vary charge-air pressure by means of
variable turbine blades. This variability makes
it possible to use a larger turbine that has a
lower exhaust-gas backpressure than 
a wastegate turbocharger. Decreasing the
compression ratio, i.e. making the piston
 recess bigger,  means that the free jet length at
full load is larger, and air efficiency increases.
At the same time the final compression tem-
perature is lower, peak temperatures during
combustion drop, and there 
is less formation of NOx.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Combustion process, other impacts on pollutant emissions

181

Combustion temperature
Together with the excess-air factor, the com-
bustion temperature has a significant influ-
ence on the formation of NOx. High tempera-
tures and excess air (λ > 1) promote the for-
mation of nitrogen oxides. In heterogeneous
diffusion combustion, local, lean zones are in-
evitable, thus increasing the formation of ni-
trogen oxides. The aim of optimizing the
combustion process, therefore, is to lower
peak temperatures in the combustion cham-
ber by raising the inert-gas component
(EGR), and optimizing mixture formation at
the same time in order to lessen the slight in-
crease in soot production. In poor combus-
tion conditions and at low temperatures, the
flame front tends to extinguish prematurely.
This occurs mainly when the engine is cold
and load is low, causing a strong rise in CO
and HC, which are the products of incomplete
combustion. To counteract this, EGR coolers
are bypassed when the engine is  running cold.
These coolers normally have 
a high cooling capacity required to reduce
NOx emissions when the engine is operating
at normal running temperatures.

Nitrogen oxides form at high temperatures
with excess air. Localized peak temperatures
and localized, high excess-air factors must
then be lowered. This is only achievable by re-
tarding the start of injection at high injection
rates during diffusion combustion. Combus-
tion starts shortly before top dead center. This
avoids almost any compression of combus-
tion products that could increase the temper-
ature. The high injection rate  results in rapid
turnover with 50% mass fraction burnt and
high EGR compatibility. High combustion-
chamber temperatures promote the forma-
tion of NOx.

Other impacts on pollutant
emissions

Engine speed
A higher engine speed means greater friction
losses in the engine and a higher power input
by the ancillary assemblies (e.g. water pump).
Engine efficiency, therefore, drops 
as engine speed increases.

If a specific performance is produced at
high engine speed, it requires a greater fuel
quantity than if the same performance is pro-
duced at low engine speed. It also produces
more pollutant emissions.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
As the time available to form NOx in the
combustion chamber is shorter at higher
 engine speeds, NOx emissions decrease as en-
gine speed increases. In addition, the resid-
ual-gas content in the combustion chamber
must be considered since it causes lower peak
temperatures. As the residual-gas content
normally drops with rising engine speed, this
effect runs counter to the interdependence
described above.

Hydrocarbons (HC) 
and carbon monoxide (CO)
As engine speed rises, HC and CO emissions
rise as the time for mixture preparation and
combustion shortens. As piston speed rises,
combustion-chamber pressure drops faster in
the expansion phase. This results in poorer
combustion conditions, especially at low
loads, and combustion efficiency suffers. On
the other hand, charge movement and turbu-
lence increase the rate of combustion as en-
gine speed rises. Combustion time becomes
shorter, and this compensates at least partly
for the poorer marginal conditions.

182

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Other impacts on pollutant emissions

The demands placed on fuel quality have also
risen due to constantly rising engine perfor-
mance. Various additives increase the cetane
number, enhance fuel lubricity and flowabil-
ity, and protect the fuel system from corro-
sion.

Fuel consumption
The quantity of emitted CO2 is proportional
to fuel consumption – therefore, any reduc-
tion in CO2 is only obtainable by lowering
fuel consumption.

Measures for diminishing NOx emissions 
to comply with more stringent limits, for
 example increasing the rate of exhaust-gas re-
circulation, result in a lower rate of combus-
tion. In turn, this retards combustion into the
expansion phase. The point of 50% mass
fraction burnt also shifts towards the expan-
sion phase. The generally poorer combustion
conditions lead to a drop in engine efficiency.
Without measures to lower fuel consump-
tion, e.g. optimizing friction, this will hike
fuel consumption, as was the case when Euro
3 was introduced.

Soot
Normally, soot becomes less as engine speed
increases, since charge movement is more in-
tense, thus resulting in better mixture
 formation.

Torque
As torque increases, so does the temperature
in the combustion chamber, and this improves
the combustion conditions. The untreated
NOx emissions, therefore, increase, whereas
the products of incomplete combustion, such
as CO and HC emissions, initially decrease. As
full load approaches, and thus low excess-air
factors (λ < 1.4), soot and CO emissions in-
crease due to oxygen deficiency.

Soot
Soot occurs due to localized oxygen deficiency
due to thermal cracking of the hydrocarbon
molecules at local temperatures above approx.
1,500 K. Consequently, enhanced air efficiency
leads to the formation of less soot, or it allows
the injection of larger quantities of fuel, and
thus increased performance for the same soot
factors.

Fuel
Another decisive factor for enhanced exhaust-
gas values are quality improvements in the
fuel. For example, sulfur-dioxide emissions
have dropped to negligible values in road
traffic since the introduction of low-sulfur or
sulfur-free fuel.

With respect to conventional combustion,

diesel fuel should have the highest possible
cetane number, i.e. optimized ignition qual-
ity. This shortens ignition lag, and has a fa-
vorable impact on combustion noise. The fuel
should also possess good lubricity, and 
a low water and impurity content to ensure
proper functioning of the fuel-injection
 system throughout its service life.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Development of homogeneous combustion processes

183

Development 
of  homogeneous 
combustion processes
New homogeneous combustion processes are
presently under development with a view to
complying with future NOx limits (in Europe,
Euro 4/Euro 5, in the U.S., Tier 2, Bin 5). They
have enormous potential for minimizing NOx
emissions compared to standard combustion
processes.

The aim is to inject the largest possible fuel
quantity, or the total quantity, during the ig-
nition lag to reduce or totally avoid the diffu-
sive phase. Striving for homogenization in the
cylinder charge (air, fuel, exhaust gas from ex-
haust-gas recirculation) minimizes localized
differences in the excess-air factor. This will
almost stop the formation of NOx and soot.

In a first stage (partly Homogeneous Com-
pressed Combustion Ignition (pHCCI)), par-
tial homogenization is implementable on
conventional diesel engines within a limited
engine-speed and load range. This is mainly
achieved by adapting the fuel-injection strat-
egy with high exhaust-gas recirculation rates
to control ignition lag and the rate of com-
bustion. This will be followed by further de-
velopment phases that aim to achieve totally
premixed combustion (Homogeneous Com-
pressed Combustion Ignition (HCCI)) in ex-
tended program-map areas. This requires an

optimization of systems and components,
such as the shape of the combustion chamber
and injection nozzles.

The disadvantage of these processes is
much higher HC and CO emissions com-
pared to standard combustion processes since
the air/fuel mixture punches through to the
combustion-chamber wall as a result of pre-
mixing. This produces wall-quenching
effects 1) similar to gasoline engines. The high
exhaust-gas recirculation rates also lead to a
reduction in bulk quenching, and thus to a
rise in the products of incomplete combus-
tion.

Homogenization becomes gradually more

problematic as increases occur in load, in-
jected fuel quantity, combustion-chamber
temperatures, and pressures. Under these
conditions, a change to standard combustion
is avoidable, with the result that it must al-
ways be possible to control both operating
modes. Homogeneous combustion requires
more development work and control con-
cepts to cope with operating-mode switch -
over, sensitivity to the slightest fluctuations in
the exhaust-gas recirculation rate with  regard
to combustion noise and stability, and in-
creased HC and CO emissions.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

Diesel fuel injection

The combustion processes in the diesel en-
gine, also linked to engine performance, fuel
consumption, exhaust-gas composition, and
combustion noise, depend to a great extent
on how the air/fuel mixture is prepared. The
fuel-injection parameters that are decisive on
the quality of the mixture formation are pri-
marily:
(cid:1) start of injection
(cid:1) rate-of-discharge curve and injection

 duration

(cid:1) injection pressure
(cid:1) number of injection events

On the diesel engine, exhaust-gas and noise
emissions are largely reduced by measures in-
side of the engine, i.e. combustion-process
control.

Until the 1980s injected fuel quantity and
start of injection were controlled on vehicle
engines by mechanical means only. However,
compliance with prevailing emission limits re-
quires the high-precision adjustment of injec-
tion parameters, e.g. pre-injection, main injec-
tion, injected fuel quantity, injection pressure,
and start of injection, adapted 
to the engine operating state. This is only
achievable using an electronic control unit
that calculates injection parameters as a  factor
of temperature, engine speed, load,  altitude
(elevation), etc. Electronic Diesel Control
(EDC) has generally become widespread on
diesel engines.

As exhaust-gas emission standards become
more severe in future, further measures for
minimizing pollutants will have to be intro-
duced. Emissions, as well as combustion
noise, can continue to be reduced by means
of very high injection pressures, as achieved
by the Unit Injector System, and by a rate-of-
discharge curve that is adjustable indepen-
dent of pressure buildup, as implemented by
the common-rail system.

Mixture distribution
Excess-air factor λ
The excess-air factor λ (lambda) was intro-
duced to indicate the degree by which the
 actual air/fuel mixture actually deviates from
the stoichiometric 1) mass ratio. It indicates
the ratio of intake-air mass to air mass
 required for stoichiometric combustion:

λ =

Air mass
Fuel mass · Stoichiometric ratio

λ = 1: The intake-air mass is equal to the air
mass theoretically required to burn all of the
fuel injected. 

λ < 1: The intake-air mass is less than the
amount required and, therefore, the mixture
is rich. 

λ > 1: The intake-air mass is greater than the
amount required and, therefore, the mixture
is lean.

1) The stoichiometric ratio indicates the air mass in kg
 required to completely burn 1 kg of fuel mL/mK). 
For diesel fuel, this is approx. 14.5.

Lambda levels in diesel engines
Rich areas of mixture are responsible for
sooty combustion. In order to prevent the
formation of too many rich areas of mixture,
diesel engines – in contrast to gasoline en-
gines – must run with an overall excess 
of air.

The lambda levels for turbocharged diesel
engines at full load range from λ = 1.15 to λ =
2.0. When idling, and under no-load condi-
tions, these figures rise to λ >10.

These excess-air factors represent the ratio of
total masses of fuel and air in the cylinder.
However, the lambda factor, which is subject
to strong spatial fluctuation, is primarily re-
sponsible for auto-ignition and 
the production of pollutants.

Diesel engines operate with heterogeneous
mixture formation and auto-ignition. It is not
possible to achieve complete homogeneous
mixing of the injected fuel with the air charge
prior to or during combustion. Within the
heterogeneous mixture in a diesel engine, the
localized excess-air factors can cover the en-
tire range from λ = 0 (pure fuel) in the spray
core close to the injector, through λ = ∞ (pure
air) at the spray periphery. Around the outer
zone of a single liquid droplet (vapor enve-
lope), there are  localized lambda levels of 0.3
to 1.5 (Figs. 2 and 3). From this, it can be de-
duced that  optimized atomization (large

numbers of very small droplets), high levels
of excess air, and “metered” motion of the air
charge produce large numbers of localized
zones with lean, combustible lambda levels.
This results in less soot occurring during
combustion. EGR compatibility then rises,
and NOx emissions are reduced.

Optimized fuel atomization is achieved by
high injection pressures that range up to max.
2,200 bar for UIS. Common-Rail Systems
(CRS) operate at an injection pressure of
max. 1,800 bar. This leads to a high relative
velocity between the fuel spray and the air in
the cylinder, resulting in a scattering 
of the fuel spray.

With a view to reducing engine weight 
and cost, the aim is to obtain as much power
as possible from a given engine capacity. 
To achieve this, the engine must run on the
lowest possible excess air at high loads. On the
other hand, a deficiency in excess air increases
the amount of soot emissions. Therefore, soot
has to be limited by precisely metering the in-
jected fuel quantity to match the available air
mass as a factor of engine speed.

Low atmospheric pressure (e.g. at high

 elevations) also requires adjustment of the in-
jected fuel quantity to the smaller amount of
available air.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

Start of injection and delivery
Start of injection
The point at which injection of fuel into the
combustion chamber starts has a decisive
 effect on the point at which combustion of
the air/fuel mixture starts and, therefore, on
emission levels, fuel consumption, and com-
bustion noise. For this reason, start of injec-
tion plays a major role in optimizing engine
performance characteristics.

Start of injection specifies the position stated
in degrees of crankshaft rotation relative to
crankshaft Top Dead Center (TDC) at which
the injection nozzle opens, and fuel 
is injected into the engine combustion cham-
ber.

The position of the piston relative to top
dead center at that moment influences the
flow of air inside of the combustion chamber,
as well as air density and temperature. Ac-
cordingly, the degree of mixing of air and fuel
is also dependent on start of injection. Thus,
start of injection affects emissions such as

soot, nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hy-
drocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide
(CO).

The start-of-injection setpoints vary accord-
ing to engine load, speed, and temperature.
Optimized values are determined for each en-
gine, taking into consideration the impacts
on fuel consumption, pollutant emission, and
noise. These values are then stored in a start-
of-injection program map (Fig. 4). Load-de-
pendent start-of-injection variability is con-
trolled across the program map.

Compared with cam-controlled systems,
common-rail systems offer more freedom in se-
lecting the quantity and timing of injection
events and injection pressure. As a consequence,
fuel pressure is built up by a separate high-pres-
sure pump, optimized to every operating point
by the engine management system, and fuel in-
jection is controlled by a solenoid valve or
piezoelectric element.

Diesel fuel injection

187

Standard values for start of injection
On a diesel-engine data map, the optimum
points of combustion start for low fuel con-
sumption are in the range of 0...8° crankshaft
angle before TDC. As a result, and based on
statutory exhaust-gas emission limits, the
start of injection points are as  follows:

Retarded start of injection
A retarded start of injection at low-load con-
ditions can result in incomplete combustion
and, therefore, in the emission of unburned
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide
(CO) since the temperature in the combustion
chamber is already dropping (Fig. 5).

Direct-injection car engines:
(cid:1) No load: 2° crankshaft angle before TDC to

4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:1) Part load: 6° crankshaft angle before TDC

to 4° crankshaft angle after TDC

(cid:1) Full load: 6 to 15° crankshaft angle before

TDC

TDC

Direct-injection commercial-vehicle engines 
(without exhaust-gas recirculation):
(cid:1) No load: 4 to 12° crankshaft angle before

(cid:1) Full load: 3 to 6° crankshaft angle before
TDC to 2° crankshaft angle after TDC

When the engine is cold, the start of injection
for car and commercial-vehicle engines is 3 to
10° earlier. Combustion time at full load is 40
to 60° crankshaft angle.

Advanced start of injection
The highest compression temperature (final
compression temperature) occurs shortly
 before piston Top Dead Center (TDC). If com-
bustion starts a long way before TDC, combus-
tion pressure rises steeply, and acts 
as a retarding force against the piston stroke.
Heat lost in the process diminishes engine
 efficiency and, therefore, increases fuel con-
sumption. The steep rise in compression pres-
sure also makes combustion much noisier.
An advanced start of injection increases
temperature in the combustion chamber. 
As a result, NOx emission levels rise, but 
HC emissions are lower (Fig. 5).

Minimizing blue and white smoke levels
 requires advanced start of injection and/or
pre-injection when the engine is cold.

The partially conflicting tradeoffs of specific
fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions
on the one hand, and soot (black smoke) and
NOx emissions on the other,  demand com-
promises and very tight tolerances when
modifying the start of injection to suit a par-
ticular engine.

Start of delivery
In addition to start of injection, start of
 delivery is another aspect that is often consid-
ered. It relates to the point at which the fuel-
injection pump starts to deliver fuel to the in-
jector.

On older fuel-injection systems, start of de-

livery plays an important role since the in-
line or distributor injection pump must be al-
located to the engine. The relative timing be-
tween pump and engine is fixed at start of de-
livery, since this is easier to define than the
actual start of injection. This is made possible
because there is a definite relationship be-
tween start of delivery and start of injection
(injection lag 1)).

Injection lag results from the time it takes

the pressure wave to travel from the high-
pressure pump through to the injection noz-
zle. Therefore, it depends on the length of the
line. At different engine speeds, there is a dif-
ferent injection lag measured as a crankshaft
angle (degrees of crankshaft rotation). At
higher engine speeds, the engine has a greater
ignition lag 2) related to the crankshaft posi-
tion (in degrees of crankshaft angle). Both of
these effects must be compensated for –
which is why a fuel-injection system must be
able to adjust the start of delivery/start of in-
jection in response to engine speed, load, and
temperature.

Injected-fuel quantity
The required fuel mass, me, for an engine
cylinder per power stroke is calculated using
the following equation:

me =

P · be · 33.33
n · z

[mg/stroke]

where:
P engine power in kilowatts
be engine specific fuel

consumption in g/kWh

n engine speed in rpm 
z number of engine cylinders

Injection duration
One of the main parameters of the rate-of-
discharge curve is injection duration. During
this period, the injection nozzle is open, and
fuel flows into the combustion chamber. This
parameter is specified in degrees of crank-
shaft or camshaft angle, or in milli seconds.
Different diesel combustion processes require
different injection durations, as  illustrated by
the following examples  (approximate figures
at rated output):
(cid:1) Passenger-car direct-injection (DI) engine 

approx. 32...38° crankshaft angle

(cid:1) Indirect-injection car engines: 35...40° 

The corresponding fuel volume (injected fuel
quantity), QH, in mm3/stroke or mm3/injec-
tion cycle is then:

crankshaft angle

(cid:1) Direct-injection commercial-vehicle
engines: 25...36° crankshaft angle 

A crankshaft angle of 30° during injection
duration is equivalent to a camshaft angle 
of 15°. This results in an injection pump
speed 1) of 2,000 rpm, equivalent to an injec-
tion duration of 1.25 ms.

In order to minimize fuel consumption and
emissions, the injection duration must be 
defined as a factor of the operating point and
start of injection (Figs. 6 through 9).

Fuel density, (cid:0), in g/cm3 is temperature-
 dependent.

Engine power output at an assumed con-
stant level of efficiency (η~1/be) is directly
proportional to the injected fuel quantity.

The fuel mass injected by the fuel-injection
system depends on the following variables:
(cid:1) The fuel-metering cross-section of the

 injection nozzle

(cid:1) The injection duration
(cid:1) The variation over time of the difference
between the injection pressure and the
pressure in the combustion chamber

(cid:1) The density of the fuel

Diesel fuel is compressible, i.e it is com-
pressed at high pressures. This increases 
the injected fuel quantity. The deviation be-
tween the setpoint quantity in the program
map and the actual quantity impacts on per-
formance and pollutant emissions. In high-
precision fuel-injection systems controlled by
electronic diesel control, the required  injected
fuel quantity can be metered with a high 
degree of accuracy.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

Rate-of-discharge curve
The rate-of-discharge curve describes the
fuel-mass flow plotted against time when in-
jected into the combustion chamber  during
the injection duration.

Rate-of-discharge curve on cam-controlled
fuel-injection systems
On cam-controlled fuel-injection systems,
pressure is built up continuously throughout
the injection process by the fuel-injection
pump. Thus, the speed of the pump has a di-
rect impact on fuel delivery rate and, conse-
quently, on injection pressure.

Port-controlled distributor and in-line
fuel-injection pumps do not permit any  
pre-injection. With two-spring nozzle-and-
holder assemblies, however, the injection rate
can be reduced at the start of injection to 
improve combustion noise.

Pre-injection is also possible with sole-
noid-valve controlled distributor injection
pumps. Unit Injector Systems (UIS) for
 passenger cars are equipped with hydro -
mechanical pre-injection, but its control 
is only limited in time.

Pressure generation and delivery of the
 injected fuel quantity are interlinked by 
the cam and the injection pump in cam-
controlled systems. This has the following 
impacts on injection characteristics:

(cid:1) Injection pressure rises as engine speed and
injected fuel quantity increase, and until
maximum pressure is reached (Fig. 10).
(cid:1) Injection pressure rises at the start of injec-
tion, but drops back to nozzle-closing pres-
sure before the end of injection (starting at
end of delivery).

The consequences of this are as follows:
(cid:1) Small injected fuel quantities are injected 

at lower pressure.

(cid:1) The rate-of-discharge curve is approxi-

mately triangular in shape.

This triangular curve promotes combustion
in part-load and at low engine speeds since 
it achieves a shallower rise, and thus quieter
combustion; however, this curve is less bene-
ficial at full-load as a square curve achieves
better air efficiency.

On indirect-injection engines (engines
with prechamber or whirl chambers), throt-
tling-pintle nozzles are used to produce a sin-
gle jet of fuel and define the rate-of-discharge
curve. This type of injection nozzle controls
the outlet cross-section as a function of nee-
dle lift. It produces a gradual  increase in pres-
sure and, consequently, “quiet combustion”.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

191

Since the electronic control unit triggers the
injectors, start of injection, injection dura-
tion, and injection pressure are freely defin-
able for the various engine operating points
in an engine application. They are controlled
by Electronic Diesel Control (EDC). EDC
balances out injected-fuel-quantity spread 
in individual injectors by means of injector
delivery compensation (IMA).

Modern piezoelectric common-rail fuel-in-
jection systems permit several pre-injection
and secondary injection events. In fact, up 
to five injection events are possible during 
a power cycle.

Rate-of-discharge curve in the
common-rail system
A high-pressure pump generates the fuel-rail
pressure independently of the injection cycle.
Injection pressure during the injection
process is virtually constant (Fig. 11). At a
given system pressure, the injected fuel quan-
tity is proportional to the length of time the
injector is open, and it is independent of en-
gine or pump speed (time-based injection).

This results in an almost square rate-of-dis-
charge curve which intensifies with short in-
jection durations and the almost constant,
high spray velocities at full-load, thus permit-
ting higher specific power outputs.

However, this is not beneficial to combustion
noise since a large quantity of fuel is  injected
during ignition lag because of the high injec-
tion rate at the start of injection. This leads to
a high pressure rise during  premixed com-
bustion. As it is possible to  exclude up to two
pre-injection events, the combustion cham-
ber can be precon ditioned. This shortens ig-
nition lag and achieves the lowest possible
noise emissions.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

Injection functions
Depending on the application for which the
engine is intended, the following injection
functions are required (Fig. 12):
(cid:1) Pre-injection (1) reduces combustion noise

and NOx emissions, in particular 
on DI engines.

(cid:1) Positive-pressure gradient during the main
injection event (3) reduces NOx emissions
on engines without exhaust-gas recircula-
tion.

(cid:1) Two-stage pressure gradient (4) during 
the main injection event reduces NOx
and soot emissions on engines without 
exhaust-gas recirculation.

(cid:1) Constant high pressure during the main in-
jection event (3, 7) reduces soot emissions
when operating the engine with exhaust-
gas recirculation.

(cid:1) Advanced secondary injection (8) reduces

soot emissions.

(cid:1) Retarded secondary injection (9).

Pre-injection
The pressure and temperature levels in the
cylinder at the point of main injection rise 
 if a small fuel quantity (approx. 1 mg) is
burned during the compression phase. This
shortens the ignition lag of the main injection
event and has a positive impact on combus-
tion noise, since the proportion of fuel in the

13

Effect of pre-injection on combustion-pressure 
pattern

premixed combustion process decreases. At
the same time the quantity of diffuse fuel
combusted increases. This increases soot and
NOx emissions, also due to the higher temper-
ature prevailing in the cylinder.

On the other hand, the higher combustion-
chamber temperatures are favorable mainly at
cold start and in the low load range in order
to stabilize combustion and reduce HC and
CO emissions.

A good compromise between combustion

noise and NOx emissions is obtainable by
adapting the time interval between pre-injec-
tion and main injection dependent on the 
operating point, and metering the pre-in-
jected fuel quantity.

Retarded secondary injection
With retarded secondary injection, fuel is 
not combusted, but is evaporated by residual
heat in the exhaust gas. The secondary-injec-
tion phase follows the main-injection phase
during the expansion or exhaust stroke at a
point up to 200° crankshaft angle after TDC.
It injects a precisely metered quantity of fuel
into the exhaust gas. The resulting mixture of
fuel and exhaust gas is expelled through the
exhaust ports into the exhaust-gas system
during the exhaust stroke.

Retarded secondary injection is mainly
used to supply hydrocarbons which also cause
an increase in exhaust-gas temperature by ox-
idation in an oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter. This measure is used to regenerate
downstream exhaust-gas treatment systems,
such as particulate filters or NOx accumula-
tor-type catalytic converters.

Since retarded secondary injection may
cause thinning of the engine oil by the diesel
fuel, it needs clarification with the engine
manufacturer. 

Advanced secondary injection
On the common-rail system, secondary injec-
tion can occur directly after main injection
while combustion is still taking place. In this
way, soot particles are reburned, and soot
emissions can be reduced by 20 to 70%.

Timing characteristics of fuel-injection
 systems
Figure 14 presents an example of a radial-pis-
ton distributor pump (VP44). The cam on
the cam ring starts delivery, and fuel then ex-
its from the nozzle. It shows that pressure and
injection patterns vary greatly between the
pump and the nozzle, and are determined by
the characteristics of the components that
control injection (cam, pump, high-pressure
valve, fuel line, and nozzle). For this reason,
the fuel-injection system must be precisely
matched to the engine.

The characteristics are similar for all fuel-
injection systems in which pressure is gener-
ated by a pump plunger (in-line injection
pumps, unit injectors, and unit pumps).

Detrimental volume in conventional  injection
systems
The term “detrimental volume” refers to the
volume of fuel on the high-pressure side of
the fuel-injection system. This is made up of
the high-pressure side of the fuel-injection
pump, the high-pressure fuel lines, and the
volume of the nozzle-and-holder assembly.
Every time fuel is injected, the detrimental
volume is pressurized and depressurized. As a
result, compression losses occur, thus retard-
ing injection lag. The fuel volume inside of
the pipes is compressed by the dynamic
processes generated by the pressure wave.

The greater the detrimental volume, the
poorer the hydraulic efficiency of the fuel-in-
jection system. A major consideration when
developing a fuel-injection system is, there-
fore, to minimize detrimental volume as
much as possible. The unit injector system
has the smallest detrimental volume.

In order to guarantee uniform control of
the engine, the detrimental volume must be
equal for all cylinders.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

Injection pressure
The process of fuel injection uses pressure 
in the fuel system to induce the flow of fuel
through the injector jets. A high fuel-system
pressure results in a high rate of fuel outflow
at the injection nozzle. Fuel atomization is
caused by the collision of the turbulent jet 
of fuel with the air inside of the combustion
chamber. Therefore, the higher the relative
velocity between fuel and air, and the higher
the density of the air, the more finely the fuel
is atomized. The injection pressure at the
nozzle may be higher than in the fuel-
 injection pump because of the length of 
the high-pressure fuel line, whose length 
is matched to the reflected pressure wave.

Direct-injection (DI) engines
On diesel engines with direct injection, the
velocity of the air inside of the combustion
chamber is relatively slow since it only moves
as a result of its mass moment of inertia
(i.e. the air “attempts” to maintain the velocity
at which it enters the cylinder; this causes
whirl). The piston stroke intensifies whirl in
the cylinder since the restricted flow forces
the air into the piston recess, and thus into a
smaller diameter. In general, however, air mo-
tion is less and in indirect-injection engines.

15

Influence of injection pressure and start of injection on
fuel consumption, soot and nitrogen-oxide emissions

The fuel must be injected at high pressure
due to low air flow. Modern direct-injection
systems now generate full-load peak pressures
of 1,000...2,050 bar for car engines, and
1,000...2,200 bar for commercial vehicles.
However, peak pressure is available only 
at higher engine speeds – except on the 
common-rail system.

A decisive factor to obtain an ideal torque
curve with low-smoke operation (i.e. with low
particulate emission) is a relatively high injec-
tion pressure adapted to the combustion
process at low full-load engine speeds. Since
the air density in the cylinder is relatively low
at low engine speeds, injection pressure must
be limited to avoid depositing fuel on the
cylinder wall. Above about 2,000 rpm, the
maximum charge-air pressure becomes avail-
able, and injection pressure can rise to maxi-
mum.

To obtain ideal engine efficiency, fuel must be
injected within a specific, engine-speed-de-
pendent angle window on either side of TDC.
At high engine speeds (rated output), there-
fore, high injection pressures are required to
shorten the injection duration.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
On diesel engines with divided combustion
chambers, rising combustion pressure expels
the charge out of the prechamber or whirl
chamber into the main combustion chamber.
This process runs at high air velocities in the
whirl chamber, in the connecting  passage 
between the whirl chamber, and the main
combustion chamber.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Diesel fuel injection

195

Nozzle and nozzle-and-holder 
assembly designs
Secondary injection
Unintended secondary injection has a partic-
ularly undesirable effect on exhaust-gas qual-
ity. Secondary injection occurs when the in-
jection nozzle shortly re-opens after closing
and allows poorly conditioned fuel to be 
injected into the cylinder at a late stage 
in the combustion process. This fuel is not
completely burned, or may not be burned 
at all, with the result that it is released into
the exhaust gas as unburned hydrocarbons.
This undesirable effect can be prevented by
rapidly closing nozzle-and-holder assemblies,
at sufficiently high closing pressure and low
static pressure in the supply line.

Dead volume
Dead volume in the injection nozzle on 
the cylinder side of the needle-seal seats has a
similar effect to secondary injection. The fuel
accumulated in such a volume runs into the
combustion chamber on completion of 
combustion, and partly escapes into the ex-
haust pipe. This fuel component also in-
creases the level of unburned hydrocarbons
in the exhaust gas (Fig. 16). Sac-less nozzles,
in which the injection orifices are drilled into

the needle-seal seats, have the smallest dead
volume.

Injection direction 
Direct-injection (DI) engines
Diesel engines with direct injection generally
have hole-type nozzles with between 4 and 10
injection orifices (most commonly 6 to 8 in-
jection orifices) arranged as centrally as pos-
sible. The injection direction is very precisely
matched to the combustion chamber. Diver-
gences of the order of only 2 degrees from 
the optimum injection direction lead to a 
detectable increase in soot emission and fuel
consumption.

Engines with indirect injection (IDI)
Indirect-injection engines use pintle nozzles
with only a single injection jet. The nozzle 
injects the fuel into the precombustion or
whirl chamber in such a way that the glow
plug is protruding in the injection jet by 
just a fraction. The injection direction is
matched precisely to the combustion cham-
ber. Any deviations in injection direction
 result in poorer utilization of combustion 
air and, therefore, to an increase in soot and
hydrocarbon emissions.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Exhaust-gas recirculation

Exhaust-gas recirculation

Concept
Exhaust-Gas Recirculation (EGR) is a highly
effective internal engine measure to lower
NOx emissions on diesel engines. A distinc-
tion is made between:
(cid:1) Internal EGR, which is determined by valve

timing and residual gas. 

(cid:1) External EGR, which is routed to the com-
bustion chamber through additional lines
and a control valve. 

The NOx-reducing effect is mainly due to the
following causes:
(cid:1) Reduction in exhaust-gas mass flow.
(cid:1) Drop in the rate of combustion, and thus
local peak temperatures due to an increase
in the inert-gas component in the combus-
tion chamber.

(cid:1) Reduction in partial oxygen pressure or 

local excess-air factor.

Since high local temperatures (> 2,000 K) and
a sufficiently high partial oxygen pressure are
required to form NOx, the measures listed
above result in a drastic reduction in the for-
mation of NOx as the EGR rate rises. Reduc-
ing the reactive components in the combus-
tion chamber also leads to a rise in black
smoke, which limits the quantity of
 recirculated exhaust gas. 

The quantity of recirculated exhaust gas
also affects the period of ignition lag. If EGR
rates are sufficiently long in the lower part-
load range, ignition lag is so great that the
diffusive combustion component, that is so
typical of diesel engines, is strongly dimin-
ished, and combustion only starts after a large
percentage of the air and fuel has been mixed.
This partial homogenization is used in new or
future (p)HCCI combustion processes to
achieve extremely low-NOx and low-particu-
late combustion in the low part-load ranges. 

High-pressure EGR
Operating concept
EGR systems that are presently in production
are high-pressure EGRs (Fig. 1). This means
that exhaust gas is tapped upstream of the ex-
haust-gas turbocharger turbine and is routed
through a mixer to the engine  upstream of
the intake plenum. The EGR volume depends
on the pressure difference between the ex-
haust-gas backpressure upstream of the tur-
bine, intake-manifold pressure, and the posi-
tion of the pneumatically or electrically oper-
ated EGR valve. 

On car engines, the driving pressure drop
in the emission-related program-map areas is
sufficient for the most part. Only in the low-
est load points is it frequently necessary to 
restrict gas flow on the intake-manifold side
to achieve sufficiently high EGR rates. 

On truck engines, suitable measures, e.g.
VTG superchargers, venturi mixers, or flutter
valves, are always required to implement
EGR. This is because of the extended emis-
sion-related load range up to full-load, and
enhanced turbocharger efficiencies. 

EGR control
Standard EGR-rate control on passenger cars
is presently performed by measuring the air
mass and can be made more precise by com-
bining this with a lambda closed-loop con-
trol. On trucks, control is by means of a dif-
ferential-pressure signal sent to a measuring
venturi.

Low-pressure EGR
Operating concept
In future, low-pressure EGR may also come
into use besides high-pressure EGR (Fig. 2).
Recirculated exhaust gas is routed down-
stream of the turbine, tapped from the ex-
haust-gas treatment system, and injected on
the air side upstream of the compressor. 

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Exhaust-gas recirculation

197

The advantages of this are: 
(cid:1) Optimized EGR uniform distribution

 between individual cylinders.

(cid:1) More intensive cooling of the homoge-

neous mixture of exhaust gas and fresh air
after passing through the compressor and
the intercooler. 

(cid:1) Increase and complete decoupling of possi-
ble charge-air pressure from EGR rate since
the full exhaust-gas mass flow is routed
through the turbine. 

On the other hand, low-pressure EGR is less
favorable than high-pressure EGR because of
the larger volume contaminated with  exhaust
gas in dynamic operation. 

Exhaust-gas cooling
In order to enhance the effects of EGR, 
the recirculated exhaust-gas quantity is
cooled in a heat exchanger cooled by engine
coolant. This raises gas density in the intake
manifold and causes a lower final compres-
sion temperature. In general, the effects of
higher localized excess-air factors cancel each
other out as a result of increased charge den-
sity and reduced peak temperatures due to
the lower final compression temperature. At
the same time, however, EGR compatibility
rises to produce possibly higher exhaust-gas
recirculation rates at much lower NOx emis-
sions.

Minimizing emissions inside of the engine

Exhaust-gas recirculation

Outlook
EGR with variable valve timing
An internal EGR achieved using variable
valve timing would be suitable to obtain the
best possible dynamic operating behavior.
Conceivable scenarios could be, for
example, increasing the amount of residual
exhaust gas in the cylinder by advancing the
“Close exhaust port” signal, or opening the
exhaust valves during the intake phase, or
opening the intake valves during the exhaust
stroke. This would allow an adjustment of the
exhaust-gas recirculation rate from one work-
ing cycle to the other by controlling the valve
gear. The tradeoff, however, would be a high
temperature of the recirculated exhaust gas,
which would considerably limit the possible
EGR rates. 

NOx emission minimizing concepts
Complying with future emission limits on
both cars and trucks places high demands 
on the exhaust-gas concept of diesel engines.
The key measure to lower untreated NOx emis-
sions continues to be exhaust-gas recircula-
tion. As a result, EGR rates will continue to rise
in conjunction with an increase in EGR com-
patibility of the combustion pro cess. EGR 
control must be fast and precise for every
cylinder in order to achieve very low emissions
and best possible drivability. It appears that a
combination of internal EGR controlled by
variable valve timing and low-pressure EGR is
an ideal solution. 

Since diesel-engine exhaust gas already has a
low temperature at very low load points any-
way, cooling the recirculated exhaust gas at
the high EGR rates required to reduce NOx
emissions leads to unstable combustion. This
then results in a significant rise in HC and
CO emissions. A switchable EGR cooler is
very effective to increase combustion-cham-
ber temperature, stabilize combustion, reduce
untreated HC and CO emissions, and raise
exhaust-gas temperature. In particular, this
occurs in the cold start phase of the car emis-
sion test, during which the oxidation-type
catalytic converter has not reached its lightoff
temperature. It also helps the oxi dation-type
catalytic converter to reach its operating tem-
perature much faster.

Positive crankcase ventilation

199

One way to minimize oil consumption caused
by engine oil escaping through crankcase
ventilation is to return the oil via an oil sepa-
rator and only ventilate the gas. 

Ventilation
In a closed-circuit ventilation system, the un-
treated gas flow from the crankcase is routed
through a ventilation system comprising ad-
ditional components (e.g. oil separator, pres-
sure-control devices, non-return valves) to
the combustion-air intake, and from there it
is returned to the combustion chamber. In
open-loop ventilation systems, the treated gas
is blown off directly to the atmosphere. How-
ever, legislation now restricts the use of open
systems to only a few exceptional cases.

Positive crankcase  ventilation

Blowby gas
Crankcase ventilation gas (blowby gas) is 
produced as a result of combustion pro cesses
in an internal-combustion engine. Gas flows
out of the combustion chamber and into the
crankcase through design-related gaps be-
tween the cylinder walls and pistons, pistons
and piston rings, through the ring gaps of the
piston rings, and through valve seals.
Crankcase blowby gases, related to engine ex-
haust gas, may contain a multiple of hydro-
carbon concentrations. In addition to prod-
ucts arising from complete and incomplete
combustion, water (vapor), soot, and carbon
residue, this gas contains engine oil in the
form of minute droplets.

Particularly in connection with turbo charged
diesel engines and spark-ignition engines with
direct fuel injection, engine oil and soot con-
tained in the blowby gas can cause deposits
that form on turbochargers, in the intercooler,
on valves, and in the downstream soot or par-
ticulate filter (ash deposits from inorganic ad-
ditives in the  engine oil). Consequently, this
may impair operation.

Exhaust-gas treatment

Exhaust-gas treatment

In the past, diesel-engine emissions were
minimized mainly by measures implemented
inside of the engine. However, the untreated
emissions produced by many diesel-engined
cars will exceed future emission limits in Eu-
rope, the U.S.A., and Japan. The high mini-
mization rates required will presumably only
be achievable by an efficient combination of
measures inside and downstream of the en-
gine. For this reason, intense development
work is also ongoing on exhaust-gas treat-
ment systems for diesel engines in analogy 
to tried and tested processes for gasoline 
engines.

In the 1980s the three-way catalytic converter
was introduced on gasoline engines to reduce
nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC),
and carbon monoxide (CO) to form nitro-
gen. Three-way catalytic converters operate at
a λ value of 1.

In diesel engines operating with excess air,
the three-way catalytic converter can be used
not only for NOx reduction. This is because,
in the lean diesel exhaust gas, HC and CO
emissions in the catalytic converter prefer 

not to react with NOx but with exhaust-gas
oxygen.

It is relatively simple to remove HC and CO
emissions from diesel exhaust gas by means
of an oxidation catalyst. However, it is more
complicated to remove nitrogen oxides when
oxygen is present in the exhaust gas. Basically,
it is possible to  remove nitrogen in a NOx
storage catalyst, or an SCR catalytic converter
(Selective  Catalytic Reduction). 

Mixture formation inside of the diesel engine
produces much larger quantities of soot emis-
sions than in the gasoline engine. The present
trend on passenger cars is to remove soot by
means of a particulate filter downstream of
the engine, and concentrate on  internal en-
gine measures for NOx reduction and noise
suppression. On trucks, NOx emissions are
normally reduced by an SCR system down-
stream of the engine.

NOx storage catalyst

The NOx Storage Catalyst (NSC) reduces
 nitrogen oxides in two stages:
(cid:0) Loading phase: Continuous NOx storage in
storage components of the catalyst in the
lean exhaust gas.

(cid:0) Regeneration: Periodic NOx removal and

conversion in the rich exhaust gas.

As only NO2 can be stored directly, but not
NO, the NO components in the exhaust gas
are oxidized on the surface of a platinum
coating in an upstream or integrated oxida-
tion catalyst to form NO2. This reaction takes
place in several stages since the concentration
of free NO2 in the exhaust gas is reduced 
during storage, and additional NO is then 
oxidized to form NO2.

Depending on the operating point, the load-
ing phase lasts from 30 to 300 s. Accumulator
regeneration takes from 2 to 10 s.

NOx storage
The NOx storage catalyst is coated with
chemical compounds that have a strong ten-
dency to bind strongly with NO2. However,
this is a chemically reversible bond. 
Examples here are the oxides and carbonates
of  alkalines and alkaline metals. Due to the
temperature response, barium nitrate is the
main chemical used.

In the NOx storage catalyst, NO2 reacts with
the compounds on the catalyst surface
(e.g. barium carbonate, BaCO3, as storage
material), and oxygen (O2) from the lean
diesel gas to form nitrates:

BaCO3 + 2 NO2 +1/2 O2 (cid:0) BA(NO3)2 + CO2. 

(cid:1)

The NOx storage catalyst stores nitrogen
 oxides in this way. Storage is only optimized
in a material-dependent temperature interval
of the exhaust gas ranging from 250 to 450°C.
Below this temperature, NO oxidizes very
slowly to form NO2; above this temperature,
the NO2 is non-stable. Accumulator-type cat-
alytic converters also have a certain storage
capability (surface storage) at low tempera-

tures. This is sufficient to store nitrogen ox-
ides produced at low temperatures during the
start process.

As the amount of stored nitrogen oxides 
(saturation) increases, the ability to continue
to bind additional nitrogen oxides decreases.
The volume of nitrogen oxides passing
through the catalytic converter then increases
with time. There are two ways of  detecting
when the catalytic converter is charged to
such a degree that the storage phase needs to
be terminated.
(cid:0) A model-based process calculates the vol-
ume of stored nitrogen oxides, taking ac-
count of the converter state, and derives the
remaining storage capacity.

(cid:0) A NOx sensor downstream of the NOx stor-
age catalyst measures the concentration 
of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas, thus
determining the present storage level.

NOx removal and conversion
At the end of the storage phase, the catalytic
converter must be regenerated, i.e. the stored
nitrogen oxides must be removed from the
storage components and converted into ni-
trogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The
processes for NOx removal and conversion
take place separately. For this purpose, the air
deficiency in the exhaust gas (rich, λ < 1)
must be adjusted. The reducing agents em-
ployed are the substances present in the ex-
haust gas, i.e. CO, H2, and various hydrocar-
bons. Removal – described in the following
using CO as reducing agent – occurs by CO
reducing the nitrate (e.g. barium nitrate,
Ba(NO3)2) to form N2, and then forming a
carbonate together with barium:

Ba(NO3)2+3 CO (cid:0) BaCO3+2 NO + 2 CO2

This results in CO2 and NO. A rhodium coat-
ing then reduces the nitrogen oxides into N2
and CO2 using CO in the familiar way known
from the three-way catalytic converter:

2 NO + 2 CO (cid:0) N2 + 2 CO2

There are two methods of detecting when the
removal phase is complete:
(cid:0) The model-based process calculates the

quantity of nitrogen oxides remaining in
the NOx storage catalyst.

(cid:0) A lambda oxygen sensor downstream of

the catalytic converter measures the oxygen
excess in the exhaust gas, and indicates a
change in voltage from “lean” to “rich”
when removal has ended.

On diesel engines, rich operating conditions
(λ < 1) can be adjusted by retarding the injec-
tion point and throttling the intake air. Dur-
ing this phase, the engine operates at poorer
efficiency. In order to minimize any addi-
tional fuel consumption, the regeneration
phase should be as short as possible com-
pared to the storage phase. It must be guaran-
teed that the vehicle remains fully drivable
during the switchover from lean to rich
mode, and that torque, response, and noise
remain constant.

Desulfating
One problem faced by NOx storage catalysts is
their sensitivity to sulfur. Sulfur compounds
contained in fuel and lube oil oxidize to form
sulfur dioxide (SO2). The coatings used in the
catalytic converter for forming nitrates
(BaCO3), however, have a very great affinity
to sulfate, i.e. SO2 is removed from the ex-
haust gas more effectively than NOx, and is
bound in the storage material by forming sul-
fate. Sulfate bonding is not separate when the
storage is regenerated normally. The quantity
of the stored sulfate, therefore, rises continu-
ously over service time. This reduces the
number of storage places for the NOx, and
NOx conversion  decreases. To ensure suffi-
cient NOx storage capacity, the catalytic con-
verter must be desulfated (sulfur regenera-

Exhaust-gas treatment

NOx storage catalyst

203

tion) at regular intervals. If fuel contains 
10 mg/kg of sulfur (“sulfur-free fuel”), regen-
eration must take place at intervals of about
5,000 km. 

During the desulfating process, the catalytic
converter is heated to a temperature of over
650°C for a period of over 5 minutes, and it is
purged with rich exhaust gas (λ < 1). To in-
crease the temperature, the same measures
are used to regenerate the Diesel Particulate
Filter (DPF). As opposed to DPF regenera-
tion, however, O2 is completely removed from
the exhaust gas by controlling the combus-
tion process. Under these conditions, barium
sulfate is converted back to barium carbon-
ate. 

The choice of a suitable desulfating process
control (e.g. oscillating λ about 1) must make
sure that the SO2 removed is not reduced to
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by a continuous defi-
ciency of exhaust-gas oxygen, O2. H2S is al-
ready highly toxic in very small concentra-
tions and is perceptible by its intensive odor. 
The controlled conditions for desulfating
must also avoid excessive aging of the catalyst.
Although high temperatures (>750°C) accel-
erate the desulfating process, they also speed
up catalyst aging. For this reason, optimized
catalyst desulfating must take place within a
limited temperature and excess- air-factor
window, and may only have a  negligible im-
pact on drivability.

A high sulfur content in fuel will speed up
catalyst aging, since desulfating takes place
more frequently, and will also increase fuel
consumption. Ultimately, the use of storage
catalysts is dependent on general availability
of sulfur-free fuel at the filling station.

Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides

Selective catalytic reduction
of nitrogen oxides

Overview
As opposed to the NSC process (NOx Storage
Catalyst), Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR
process) operates continuously, and does not
intervene in engine operation. The process is
now being launched on production truck
models. It offers the possibility of minimizing
NOx emissions and reducing fuel consump-
tion at the same time. On the other hand,
NOx removal and conversion causes a higher
fuel consumption in the NSC process. 

In large furnaces, selective catalytic reduction
has become a tried and tested method of
waste-gas denitrification. It is based on re-
ducing certain nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the
presence of oxygen using selected reducing
agents. Here, “selective” means that the reduc-
ing agent prefers to oxidize selectively with
the oxygen contained in the nitrogen oxides
instead of with the molecular oxygen present
in much greater quantities in the exhaust gas.
Ammonia (NH3) has proven to be a highly
selective reducing agent in this case.
In a car environment, the quantities of NH3

required would raise safety issues due to the
toxicity of the chemical. However, NH3 can be
produced from nontoxic carrier substances,
such as urea or ammonium carbamate. Urea
has proved to be a good catalyst carrier. Urea,
(NH2)2CO, is produced on an industrial scale
as fertilizer and feedstuff. It is biologically
compatible with groundwater, and chemically
stable for the environment. Urea is highly 
soluble in water, and can therefore be added
to the exhaust gas as an easy-to-meter urea/
water solution. 

At a mass concentration of 32.5% urea in
water, the freezing point has a localized mini-
mum at -11°C: A eutectic solution forms, but
does not separate when frozen. 

The DENOXTRONIC 1 system was devel-
oped to meter the reducing agent in the ex-
haust gas precisely. This system is resistant to
freezing. The main components can be heated
to ensure the metering function starts shortly
after a cold start.

The urea/water solution will be obtainable
under the brand name of AdBlue – firstly at
depots, and then at all highway filling sta-
tions. The first official AdBlue pump opened
in Stuttgart (Germany) at the end of 2003. 
AdBlue complies with the draft standard
DIN 70 070 which defines the solution prop-
erties. 

Chemical reactions
Urea first forms ammonia before the actual
SCR reaction starts. This takes place in two
reaction steps, which are together termed 
a hydrolysis reaction. Firstly, NH3 and iso-
cyanic acid are formed in a thermolysis
 reaction:

(NH2)2CO (cid:0) NH3 + HNCO (thermolysis)

Then isocyanic acid is converted with water
in a hydrolysis reaction to form ammonia and
carbon dioxide.

HNCO + H2O (cid:0) NH3 + CO2 (hydrolysis)

To prevent the precipitation of solids, the sec-
ond reaction must take place rapidly by se-
lecting suitable catalysts and temperatures
that are sufficiently high (starting at 250°C).
Modern SCR reactors also assume the func-
tion of a hydrolyzing catalyst, thus dispensing
with an upstream hydrolyzing catalyst as 
previously necessary. Ammonia produced by
thermohydrolysis reacts in the SCR catalytic
converter according to the  following equa-
tions:

(cid:0) 4 NO + 4 NH3 + O2 (cid:0)
(cid:0) NO + NO2 + 2 NH3 (cid:0)
(cid:0) 6 NO2 + 8 NH3 (cid:0)

4 N2 + 6H2O (Eq. 1)

2 N2 + 3 H2O (Eq. 2)

7 N2 + 12 H2O

(Eq. 3)

At low temperatures (< 300°C), conversion
mainly takes place using reaction 2. For this
reason, it is necessary to set a NO2 : NO ratio
of about 1 : 1 to achieve good conversion at
low temperatures. Under these circumstances,
reaction 2 can take place at temperatures
starting at 170 to 200°C.

Oxidizing NO to form NOx occurs in 
an upstream oxidation catalyst, and this is
necessary to achieve optimized efficiency.

Exhaust-gas treatment

Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides

for this is approximately equivalent to 5% of
the quantity of diesel fuel used. 

The reducing-agent requirement depends
on the specific NOx emission (gNOx/kgdiesel).
The SCR process can compensated for higher
NOx emissions in the untreated  exhaust gas
occurring in the efficiency- optimized com-
bustion process by adding AdBlue. 

By arranging the hydrolysis reaction up-
stream, modern SCR catalytic converters
achieve a NOx conversion rate of > 50% only
at temperatures above approx. 250°C. Opti-
mized conversion rates are attained within 
a temperature window of 250 to 450°C. Pre-
sent catalytic-converter research is concen-
trating on extending the work temperature
window, and, in particular, on optimizing 
activity at low temperatures.

If more reducing agent is dispensed than is
converted in reduction with NOx, it may re-
sult in NH3 leakage. NH3 is a gas and has a
very low odor threshold (15 ppm). This may
cause a nuisance to the environment, but it 
is avoidable. NH3 is removable by placing an
additional oxidation catalyst downstream of
the SCR catalytic converter. This blocking
catalytic converter oxidizes any ammonia that
may occur to form N2 and H2O. In  addition, 
a careful application of metered AdBlue is 
essential. 

One key parameter for the application is the
feed ratio α, which is defined as the molar 
ratio of metered NH3 as a factor of NOx
present in the exhaust gas. Under ideal oper-
ating conditions (no NH3 leakage, no sec-
ondary reactions, no NH3 oxidation), α is di-
rectly proportional to the NOx reduction rate:
At α = 1, NOx reduction of 100% is achiev-
able in theory. In practice, however, a NOx
reduction of 90% in fixed and mobile 
operation is achievable at an NH3 leakage of
< 20 ppm. The quantity of AdBlue required

DENOXTRONIC 1
System overview
The modular DENOXTRONIC 1 system 
meters the reducing agent and comprises the
following modules:
(cid:0) Delivery module, to deliver the urea/water
solution at the required pressure to the
dosing module.

(cid:0) Dosing module, to meter the precise quan-
tity of urea/water solution and add com-
pressed air.

(cid:0) Dosing tube, to atomize and distribute the
urea/water solution in the exhaust pipe.
(cid:0) Control unit, to exchange information with
the engine ECU via CAN. This unit is fitted
in the delivery module.

Compressed air is provided from an onboard
supply to enhance atomization of the reduc-
ing-agent solution in the exhaust-gas system.

Delivery module
In the delivery module, reducing agent flows
through a prefilter to a diaphragm pump
which has an integrated pressure attenuator
and overflow valve. The solution then runs
through the main filter to the dosing module
at a max. pressure of 3.5 bar. Pressure and
temperature are monitored constantly. As re-
quired, a bleeder valve opens. It is electrically
switched and connected to the supply reser-
voir. After conditioning in this way, the re-
ducing agent flows finally to the dosing 
module.

Compressed air from the onboard air tank
enters the delivery module via a separate line.
An air-control valve and air-pressure sensor
ensure a constant admission pressure up-
stream of the central choke valve. Central
choke-valve operation is supercritical. Pres-
sure control ensures a constant air-mass flow
from the delivery module to the dosing mod-
ule. This is a key factor for precision dosing. 
A second air-pressure sensor located down-
stream of the central choke valve provides 
additional safety.

The delivery module is mounted as usual on
the vehicle chassis.

Dosing module
The urea/water solution is metered precisely
in the dosing module by a clocked solenoid
valve. The clock rate is normally 4 Hz. Precise
metering is achieved in a different control
range if system dynamics are still sufficient.
The metered urea/water solution then flows
into the venturi. Compressed air also enters
the venturi through a non-return valve and
forms a carrier air flow that transports the
urea/water solution in the form of an aerosol
and a film to the dosing tube. 

The dosing module is mounted as close to
the dosing point as possible to achieve high
system dynamics.

Dosing tube
The dosing tube represents the interface be-
tween the dosing module and the exhaust-gas
system. It provides optimized mixture forma-
tion and homogeneous mixture distribution
in the exhaust pipe. There are normally eight
holes with a diameter of 0.5 mm arranged
symmetrically around the dosing-tube cir-
cumference. The carrier-air flow passes
through these holes at high velocity, atomiz-
ing the entrained urea/water solution into
small drops that quickly evaporate. 
This accelerates the drops to high velocities to
reach all parts of the exhaust pipe.

Control unit, DCU 15
The control unit is located in the delivery
module. It reads out signals from internal and
external sensors, triggers internal and external
actuators, and performs control and monitor-
ing functions. Components are monitored,
and all inputs are checked for plausibility. 
The main function is to calculate the required
dosing quantity based on the preset dosing
strategy. The control unit also monitors the
temperatures of system components and 
secures operation at low temperatures by 
actively triggering a heating system.

208

Exhaust-gas treatment

Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides

Besides internal sensors, other parameters 
detected are the fluid level in the tank, tank
temperature, and the exhaust-gas tempera-
ture in the catalytic converter. Later construc-
tion phases planned include other  exhaust-
gas components and exhaust-gas monitoring. 

Communication with the engine control unit
runs over a CAN bus. Diagnostics take place
over an ISO-K or CAN interface.

DENOXTRONIC dosing strategy
A model-based calculation for the optimum
dosing quantity is required to optimize NOx
reduction while minimizing NH3 leakage –
i.e. permeation of NH3 through the catalyst
system. The quantity measured – e.g. on the
engine test bench – is corrected as a factor 
of the catalytic-converter temperature and
the quantity of NH3 stored in the catalytic
converter.

Standard model
The dosing quantity for the reducing agent is
stored as a function of injected fuel quantity
and engine speed In program map A, mea-
sured either on the test bench, or calculated
by a
i assumptions. The system feeds in
correction parameters, such as engine tem-
perature (to consider the effects of operating
temperature on NOx production), and the
number of system operating hours (to con-
sider aging).

The difference between fixed catalytic-
 converter temperature (stored in program
map B) and the exhaust-gas temperature
measured downstream of the catalytic
 converter is used to determine a correction
 factor for reducing-agent dosing in a third
program map C when switching between two
fixed operating points. This correction factor
minimizes NH3 leakage.

Expansion with storage block
On catalytic converters with high NH3
 storage capacity, in particular, it is recom-
mended to model the transient processes and
the quantity of NH3 actually stored. Since
NH3 storability in SCR catalytic converters
drops as temperature rises, there may other-
wise be some undesirable occurrence of NH3
leakage in transient mode and, in particular,
as exhaust-gas temperature rises. 

To avoid this effect, the catalytic-converter
temperature and the quantity of NOx pro-
duced are estimated by program maps and
time-lag devices. Catalytic-converter effi-
ciency is saved to a program map as a func-
tion of temperature and the quantity of NH3
stored. The product of the catalyst coefficient
and the NOx present in the catalyst is equiva-
lent to the converted quantity of reducing
agent. The difference between added and con-
verted reducing agent results in a (positive or
negative) factor added to the quantity of am-
monia stored in the catalyst. This is calculated
continuously. If the figure for the quantity 
of NH3 stored exceeds a fixed temperature-
dependent threshold, the dosing quantity is
reduced to avoid NH3 leakage. If the quantity
of NH3 stored drops below the threshold, the
dosing quantity is increased to optimize NOx
conversion.

Soot particles emitted from a diesel engine
can be efficiently removed from the exhaust
gas by Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF). Partic-
ulate filters used so far in passenger cars con-
sist of porous ceramics. Particulate filters
made of sintered metal are now under devel-
opment. 

Ceramic particulate filter
Ceramic particulate filters consist of a honey-
comb structure made of silicon carbide 
or Cordierite, which has a large number of
parallel, mostly square channels. The thick-
ness of the channel walls is typically 300 to
400 µm. Channel size is specified by their cell
density (Channels per Square Inch (cpsi);
typical value: 100...300 cpsi).

Adjacent channels are closed off at each
end by ceramic plugs to force the exhaust gas
to penetrate through the porous ceramic
walls. As soot particles pass through the walls,
they are transported into the pore walls by
diffusion (inside of the ceramic walls) where
they adhere (deep-bed filtration). As the filter
becomes increasingly saturated with soot, a
layer of soot forms on the surface of the
channel walls (on the side opposite to the in-
let channels). This provides highly efficient
surface filtration for the following operating
phase. However,  excessive saturation must be
prevented (see the section entitled “Regenera-
tion”).

As opposed to deep-bed filters, wall-flow fil-
ters store the particles on the surface of the
ceramic walls (surface filtration). 

Besides filters with a symmetrical arrange-
ment of square inlet and outlet channels,
 ceramic “octosquare substrates” are now on
offer (Fig. 2). They have larger octagonal inlet
channels and smaller square outlet channels.
The large inlet channels considerably increase
the storability of the particulate  filter for ash,
non-combustible residue from burned engine
oil, and additive ash (see the section entitled
“Additive system”).  Octosquare filters will
shortly be launched onto the market. 

Particulate filters made of 
sintered metal
In the sintered metal filter, the filter surfaces
comprise a metallic carrier structure com-
posed of mesh filled with sintered metal pow-
der. The filter’s design has a specific geome-
try: The filter surfaces form concentric,
wedge-shaped filter pockets through which
the exhaust gas flows. Since the slats are
closed at the rear, the exhaust gas must pass
through the walls of the filter pockets. The
soot particles are deposited on the pore walls
in a similar way to the ceramic substrate.

Both particulate filters made of sintered metal
and ceramic filters achieve a retention effi-
ciency of more than 95% for particles across
the entire spectrum range in question (10 nm
to 1 µm). 

Regeneration
Irrespective of the particulate-filter material –
ceramics or sintered metal – the material
must be freed from time to time from the de-
posited particles, i.e. it must be regenerated.
The growing amount of soot deposited in 
the filter gradually increases the exhaust-gas
backpressure. This impairs engine efficiency
and acceleration power. 

Regeneration must be carried out approxi-
mately every 500 kilometers; this figure is
subject to strong fluctuation dependent on
the untreated soot emission and filter size
(approx. 300 to 800 kilometers). Regeneration
takes about 10 to 15 minutes. The additive
system takes slightly less time. It is also de-
pendent on engine operating conditions.

The filter is regenerated by burning off the
soot that has collected in the filter. The parti-
cle carbon component can be oxidized
(burned) using the oxygen constantly present
in the exhaust gas above a temperature of ap-
prox. 600°C to form nontoxic CO2. Such high
temperatures occur only when the engine is
operating at rated output. It is highly rare in
normal vehicle operation. For this reason,
measures must be taken to lower the soot
burnoff temperature and/or raise the ex-
haust-gas temperature. 

Soot oxidizes at temperatures as low as

300...450°C using NO2 as oxidizer. This
method is used industrially in the continu-
ously regenerating trap (CRT®) system.

Compared with the ceramic filter, the sintered
metal filter has the advantage that its thermal
conductivity is better. After the soot is ignited
in part of the filter, the reaction heat occur-
ring there is transported more easily to adja-
cent areas. The soot layer is burned off evenly.
This avoids any non- regenerated soot areas
which may occur in ceramic filters under
worst-case scenarios.

212

Exhaust-gas treatment

Diesel particulate filter

Additive system
The soot oxidation temperature of 600°C can
be lowered to approx. 450...500°C by  using an
additive – usually cerium or iron compounds
– in diesel fuel. But even this temperature is
not always reached in the exhaust-gas system
when the vehicle is operating. The result is
that the soot is not burned off continuously.
Active regeneration is triggered, therefore,
above a specific level of soot saturation in the
particulate filter (see the section entitled “Sat-
uration detection”). To achieve this, the com-
bustion control in the engine is modified so
that the exhaust-gas temperature rises to the
soot burnoff temperature. This is possible by
retarding the injection point (see the section
entitled “Measures inside of the engine to
raise the exhaust-gas temperature”).

The additive in the fuel is retained in the  filter
as a residue (ash) after regeneration. This ash,
as well as ash from engine-oil or fuel residue,
gradually clogs the filter, thus raising the ex-
haust-gas backpressure. The pressure loss
across the sintered metal filter is lower than
for the ceramic filter with the same ash satu-
ration.

To reduce the pressure rise, the ash storability
of sintered metal filters and ceramic oc-
tosquare filters must be increased by making
the cross-sections of the inlet channels as
large as possible. This provides the filters with
sufficient capacity to accommodate all the ash
residue occurring on burnoff during the nor-
mal service life of the vehicle. 

With conventional ceramic filters, it is as-
sumed that the filter is removed approxi-
mately every 120,000 km when additive-
based regeneration is used, and cleaned
 mechanically. 

Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter (CDPF)
Soot-particle burnoff can also be improved
by coating the filter with noble metals
(mainly platinum). However, the effect is less
than when using an additive. 

The CDPF requires further measures for
regeneration to raise the exhaust-gas temper-
ature, similar to the measures taken with the
additive system. Compared with the additive
system, however, the catalyzed coating has the
advantage that no additive ash occurs in the
filter.

The catalyzed coating has several functions:
(cid:0) It oxidizes CO and HC
(cid:0) It oxidizes NO to form NO2
(cid:0) It oxidizes CO to form CO2

Oxidizing CO and HC
It also oxidizes CO and HC, as in the oxida-
tion-type catalytic converter. At high CO and
HC emissions, the energy released can be sig-
nificant (see the section entitled “Oxidation
catalyst”). The resulting temperature hike acts
directly on the point where high tempera-
tures are required to ignite the soot. This
avoids heat losses that may occur with an up-
stream catalytic burner. 

Oxidizing NO to form NO2
NO is oxidized on the catalyzed coating to
form NO2. NO2 is a more active oxidizer than
O2 and, therefore, oxidizes soot at lower tem-
peratures (CRT® effect). In this  reaction, NO2
is again reduced to NO. Since exhaust-gas
flow velocity through the filter wall is slow,
any NO occurring can diffuse contrary to the
flow direction and oxidize soot in further oxi-
dation reducing cycles. 

Oxidizing CO to form CO2
Another phenomenon is oxidizing CO pro-
duced during soot oxidation at low regenera-
tion temperatures to form CO2. Soot burnoff
is enhanced by localized heat generation. 

CRT® system
Truck engines run close to maximum torque
more frequently than car engines, i.e. causing
comparatively high NOx emissions. On
trucks, therefore, it is possible to perform
continuous regeneration of the particulate 
filter based on the CRT® principle (Continu-
ously Regenerating Trap). 

According to this principle, soot combusts
with NO2 at temperatures as low as 300 to
450°C. The process is reliable at these temper-
atures if the mass ratio of NO2/soot is greater
than 8 : 1. To apply the process, an oxidation
catalyst is arranged upstream of the particu-
late filter to oxidize NO into NO2. In most
cases, this provides ideal conditions for regen-
eration using the CRT® system on trucks at
normal operation. The method is also termed
 “passive regeneration”, since soot is burned
continuously without the need for active
measures. 

The efficiency of this process was demon-
strated in truck fleet trials. However, other re-
generation processes are provided for trucks. 

On cars, which normally run in the low-load
range, complete regeneration of the particu-
late filter is not possible using the CRT®
 effect. 

System configuration
Irrespective of the applied particulate filter
process, the regeneration process requires a
system for control and monitoring. The sys-
tem senses the state of the filter (state func-
tions), i.e. it detects saturation level, defines
regeneration strategy, and monitors the  filter.
In addition, it controls regeneration by inter-
vening in the fuel-injection and air-intake
systems. When operating an additive system,
there are also functions for tank-level detec-
tion and additive dosing. 

The basic configuration is almost identical

for all systems.

214

Exhaust-gas treatment

Diesel particulate filter

Besides the particulate filter (DPF), the DPF
system comprises other components and 
sensors:
(cid:0) Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC)

The main function of the DOC is to mini-
mize HC and CO emissions. In DPF
 applications, it also acts as a “catalytic
burner”: By oxidizing specific hydrocar-
bons entrained (retarded secondary injec-
tion) in the DOC, the required regenera-
tion temperature is reached in the exhaust
gas. The DOC is also required for oxidizing
NO into NO2 in the CRT® system.

(cid:0) Differential-pressure sensor

The differential-pressure sensor measures
the pressure drop across the particulate 
filter; this figure is then used to calculate
filter saturation. The differential pressure 
is also used to calculate the exhaust-gas
backpressure in the engine so that it can be
limited to the maximum permitted level.
Optionally, an absolute-pressure sensor can
be fitted upstream of the DPF instead of a
differential-pressure sensor.

(cid:0) Temperature sensor upstream of the DPF
In regeneration mode, the temperature 
upstream of the DPF is the key parameter
to determine soot burnoff in the filter.
(cid:0) Temperature sensor upstream of the DOC

The temperature upstream of
the DOC helps to determine
HC convertibility (lightoff) in
the DOC.

(cid:0) Lambda oxygen sensor

The lambda oxygen sensor is
not directly a DPF system com-
ponent, but it enhances system
response even for the DPF, since
a specific emission behavior is
achieved by precise exhaust-gas
recirculation. 

Control-unit functions
Saturation detection
Two processes are used in parallel for satura-
tion detection. Flow resistance in the particu-
late filter is calculated from the pressure drop
across the filter and volumetric flow. This is a
measure of filter permeability, and thus soot
mass. 

In addition, a model is used to calculate the
soot mass stored in the DPF. The (untreated)
soot-mass flow of the engine is integrated in
this model. Corrections for system dynamics,
such as the residual oxygen part in the ex-
haust gas, etc. are taken into consideration, as
well as continuous particulate  oxidation by
NO2. During thermal regeneration, soot
burnoff is calculated in the control unit as a
factor of DPF temperature and oxygen mass
flow.

Soot mass is calculated by a coordinator
using the soot masses determined in both
processes, and this becomes the key factor 
in the regeneration strategy.

by a signal-curve evaluation circuit. The tem-
perature sensors upstream of the DOC and
the DPF are checked at cold start for plausi-
bility with other EDC temperature sensors.

Regeneration measures in the fuel-injection
and air-intake systems
When a regeneration request is received, 
the fuel-injection and air-intake systems are
switched over to other setpoint parameters
via ramp signals. The driver does not perceive
any change in torque or noise. The interven-
tions to achieve the required regeneration
temperature in the exhaust gas depend on 
the operating point (see the section entitled
“Measures inside of the engine to raise the 
exhaust-gas temperature”). 

Exhaust-gas temperature controller
The exhaust-gas temperature is controlled
during unfavorable ambient conditions and
throughout the entire filter service life to
 ensure reliable regeneration. The controller
design is cascaded to mirror the split in re-
generation measures (see the section entitled
“Measures inside of the engine to raise the 
exhaust-gas temperature”).

Regeneration strategy
As the quantity of soot mass rises in the filter,
regeneration must be triggered in good time.
As filter saturation increases, the quantity of
heat released during soot burnoff increases,
as well as peak temperatures in the filter. To
prevent these temperatures from destroying
the filter, regeneration must be triggered be-
fore a critical saturation state is reached. 
Depending on the filter material, 5 to 10 g of
soot per liter of filter volume is cited as the
critical saturation mass.

A good strategy is to bring forward regenera-
tion when conditions are favorable (e.g. when
driving on the highway), or delay regenera-
tion when the conditions are poor. 

The regeneration strategy defines when
and what regeneration measures are per-
formed, dependent on the soot mass in the
filter, and the engine and vehicle operating
states. These parameters are transmitted as
status values to all other engine-control func-
tions.

Monitoring
The differential-pressure sensor helps 
to monitor whether the filter is possibly
blocked, broken, or removed. The DPF-
 system sensors are also monitored. Besides
standard monitoring, the plausibility of val-
ues of the downstream differential-pressure
sensor is also monitored. In dynamic opera-
tion, the supply line between the exhaust-gas
system and the pressure sensor is monitored

Exhaust-gas treatment

Diesel particulate filter

Measures inside of the engine to raise
the exhaust-gas temperature
The temperature level of 550 to 650°C re-
quired for regeneration during standard
diesel-engine operation is only reached at
high engine speeds and at full load. 

The main measures taken inside of the engine
(engine burner) to increase exhaust-gas tem-
perature are advanced, “burnoff ” or “addi-
tive” secondary injection, retarded main in-
jection, and intake-air throttling. Depending
on the engine operating point, one or several
of these measures are triggered during regen-
eration. In some operating points, these mea-
sures are supplemented by retarding sec-
ondary injection. This leads to a further in-
crease in exhaust-gas temperature due to 
oxidation of fuel in the DOC no longer con-
verted in the combustion  chamber (cat
burner).

Figures 7 and 8 shows typical exhaust-gas
temperatures and engine measures required
for regeneration as a factor of engine speed
and load. Using the described combination 
of measures, only one temperature of 600°C
is set downstream of the DOC at a residual
oxygen content of > 5%. The residual oxygen
content is important since soot burnoff is too
slow at lower O2 concentrations. 

Across the entire program map, exhaust-gas
recirculation is shut down during regenera-
tion to avoid high components of unburned
hydrocarbons in the combustion air. At the
same time this provides a stable single-con-
troller concept for air-mass control.

The program map is roughly divided into six
areas which feature different measures for
raising temperature.

Area 1:
No engine measures are required since the 
exhaust-gas temperature in the basic applica-
tion is over 600°C. 

Area 2:
Firstly, the start of injection for main injec-
tion is retarded; secondly, a secondary injec-
tion event is added. Here, secondary injection
is still part of the combustion process and
contributes to the torque produced.

Area 3:
Due to the low supercharge and the large
quantity of fuel, the excess-air factor in this
area is λ < 1.4. An added, i.e. advanced, sec-
ondary injection event would lead to local-
ized, extremely low excess-air factors, and
thus to a drastic increase in black-smoke
emissions; for this reason, a delayed, i.e.
 retarded secondary injection event is 
applied instead.

Area 4:
The required temperature rise is achieved by
a combination of lowering charge-air pres-
sure, triggering secondary injection, and by
retarding main injection. The parts of the 
individual measures must be optimized with
respect to emissions, fuel consumption, and
noise. In most cases, not all of these measures
are required at the same time.

Area 5:
This area requires a large temperature hike
compared with normal operation. For this
reason, the air mass must be reduced by the
throttle valve in addition to the measures de-
scribed above. Further measures for stabiliz-
ing the combustion process are needed, e.g.
increasing the quantity of fuel for pre-injec-
tion, and adapting the time interval  between
pre-injection and main injection.

Area 6:
Only in this small area is it not possible to
achieve stable regeneration at temperatures
> 600°C downstream of the catalytic con-
verter.

Exhaust-gas treatment

Diesel oxidation catalyst

Diesel oxidation catalyst

Operation
The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) fulfils 
a variety of functions for exhaust-gas treat-
ment:
(cid:0) Reduction in CO and HC emissions. 
(cid:0) Reduction in particle mass.
(cid:0) Oxidation of NO to form NO2.
(cid:0) Use as catalytic burner. 

Reduction in CO and HC emissions 
Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons
(HC) are oxidized to form carbon dioxide
(CO2) and water vapor (H2O) in the DOC.
Oxidation in the DOC is almost complete,
starting from a specific limit temperature, i.e.
the lightoff temperature. Depending on ex-
haust-gas composition, flow velocity, and cat-
alyst composition, the lightoff temperature
takes place at about 170 to 200°C.  Starting
with this temperature, conversion rises up to
over 90% within a temperature interval of
20...30°C.

Reduction in particle mass
The particles emitted by the diesel engine
consist partly of hydrocarbons which desorb
from the particle core as temperature rises.
Particle Mass (PM) can be reduced by 15 to
30% by oxidizing these hydrocarbons in the
DOC.

Oxidation of NO to form NO2
A prime function of the DOC is to oxidize
NO to form NO2. A high NO2 component in
the NOx is vital for a number of downstream
components (particulate filter, NSC, SCR).

In the untreated engine exhaust gas, the NO2
component in the NOx is only about 1 : 10 at
most operating points. NO2 is in tempera-
ture-dependent equilibrium with NO in the
presence of oxygen (O2). This equilibrium 
is on the part of NO2 at low temperatures
(< 250°C). Above about 450°C, however, NO
becomes the thermodynamically preferred
component. The function of the DOC is to
raise the NO2 : NO ratio at low temperatures
by inducing thermodynamic equilibrium.
Depending on the catalyst coating and com-
position of the exhaust gas, this is achieved
above a temperature of 180 to 230°C, when
the concentration of NO2 rises sharply within
this temperature range. In compliance with
thermodynamic equilibrium, the NO2 con-
centration continues to drop as the tempera-
ture rises.

Catalytic burner
The oxidation catalyst can also be used as a
catalytic heater (catalytic burner, cat burner).
Reaction heat released when CO and HC are
oxidized is used to raise the  exhaust-gas tem-
perature downstream of the DOC. CO and
HC emissions are raised specifically for this
purposes by means of an engine secondary
injection, or a fuel injector downstream of
the engine. 

Catalytic burners are used to raise the
 exhaust-gas temperature during particulate-
filter regeneration, for example. 

As an approximation for the heat released
during oxidation, the temperature of the
 exhaust gas rises by about 90°C for every 1%
volume of CO. Since the temperature rise 
is very rapid, a steep temperature gradient be-
comes set in the catalytic converter. In the
worst-case scenario, CO and HC are con-
verted and heat is released only in the front
area of the catalytic converter. The resulting
stress in the ceramic carrier and catalytic con-
verter is limited to the permitted temperature
hike of about 200 to 250°C. 

Exhaust-gas treatment

Diesel oxidation catalyst

Design
Structural design
Oxidation catalysts consist of a carrier struc-
ture made of ceramics or metal, an oxide
mixture (washcoat) composed of aluminum
oxide (Al2O3), cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2), 
zirconium oxide (ZrO2), and active catalytic
noble metals, such as platinum (Pt), palla-
dium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh). 

The prime function of the washcoat is to pro-
vide a large surface area for the noble metal,
and to slow down catalyst sintering that oc-
curs at high temperatures, leading to an irre-
versible drop in catalyst activity. The highly
porous structure of the washcoat must be 
stable enough to resist against  sintering
processes.

The quantity of noble metals used for the
coating, often referred to as the loading, is
specified in g/ft3. The loading is approxi-
mately 50 to 90 g/ft3 (1.8...3.2 g/l). Since 
only surface atoms are chemically active,
 development aims at producing and stabiliz-
ing noble-metal particles that are as small as
possible (of the order of magnitude of a few
nm) in order to minimize the use of noble
metals.

Differences in the structural design of the 
catalytic converter and choice of catalyst
composition change major properties, such as
lightoff temperature, conversion, temperature
stability, tolerance to poisoning, as well as
manufacturing costs. 

Internal structure
The main parameters of a catalytic converter
are channel density (specified in cpsi (chan-
nels per square inch)), wall thickness of the
individual channels, and the external dimen-
sions of the catalytic converter (cross-sec-
tional area and length). Channel density and
wall thickness determine heatup response, 
exhaust-gas backpressure, and mechanical
 stability of the catalytic converter. 

Design
The catalyst volume Vcat is defined as a factor
of exhaust-gas volumetric flow, which is itself
proportional to the swept volume Vstroke of
the engine. Typical design figures for an oxi-
dation catalyst are Vcat/Vstroke = 0.6...0.8. 

The ratio of exhaust-gas volumetric flow to
catalyst volume is termed flow velocity (unit:
h–1). Typical figures for an oxidation catalyst
are 150,000...250,000 h–1.

Operating conditions
Besides use of the correct catalyst, the main
factors governing the efficiency of exhaust-
gas treatment are the correct operating condi-
tions. They are adjustable by the engine man-
agement system within a wide range.

If the operating temperatures are excessively
high, sintering processes will occur, i.e. several
small noble-metal particles will clump to-
gether to form a larger particle with a corre-
spondingly smaller surface area, and thus 
reduced activity. The function of exhaust-gas
temperature management is, therefore, to 
enhance the service life of the catalytic con-
verter by avoiding excessive temperatures.

Elect ronic Diesel Control (EDC)

System overview

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Electronic control of a diesel engine allows
fuel-injection parameters to be varied pre-
cisely for different conditions. This is the
only means by which a modern diesel engine
is able to satisfy the many demands placed
upon it. The EDC (Electronic Diesel Con-
trol) system is subdivided into three areas,
“Sensors and desired-value generators”,
“Control unit”, and “Actuators”.

System overview

Requirements
Present-day development in the field of
diesel technology is focused on lowering 
fuel consumption and exhaust-gas emissions
(NOx, CO, HC, particulate), while increasing
engine performance and torque. In recent
years this has led to an increase in the popu-
larity of the direct-injection (DI) diesel en-
gine, which uses much higher fuel-injection
pressures than indirect-injection (IDI) en-
gines with whirl or prechamber systems.
Due to the more efficient mixture formation
and the absence of flow-related losses be-
tween the whirl chamber/prechamber and
the main combustion chamber, the fuel
 consumption of direct-injection engines 
is 10...20% lower than that achieved by
 indirect-injection designs.

In addition, diesel engine development has
been influenced by the high levels of com-
fort and convenience demanded in modern
cars. Noise levels, too, are subject to more
and more stringent requirements.

As a result, the performance demanded 
of fuel-injection and engine-management
systems has also increased, specifically with
regard to:
(cid:0) High fuel-injection pressures
(cid:0) Rate-of-discharge curve control
(cid:0) Pre-injection and, where applicable, 

secondary injection

(cid:0) Variation of injected fuel quantity, charge-
air pressure, and start of injection to suit
operating conditions

(cid:0) Temperature-dependent excess-fuel quan-

tity for starting

(cid:0) Control of idle speed independent of

(cid:0) Controlled exhaust-gas recirculation

 engine load

(cid:0) Tight tolerances for injection duration
and  injected fuel quantity, and mainte-

mance)

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

System overview

221

Conventional mechanical governing of engine
speed uses a number of adjusting mechanisms
to adapt to different engine operating condi-
tions and ensures a high mixture formation
quality. Nevertheless, it is restricted to a sim-
ple engine-based control loop and there are a
number of important influencing variables
that it cannot take account of or cannot re-
spond quickly enough to.

As demands have increased, what was orig-
inally a straightforward system using electric
actuator shafts has developed into the pre-
sent-day EDC, a complex electronic control
system capable of processing large amounts
of data in real time. It can form part of an
overall electronic vehicle control system
(“drive-by-wire”). And a result of the increas-
ing integration of electronic components, the
control-system circuitry can be accommo-
dated in a very small space.

Operating concept
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) is capable 
of meeting the requirements listed above as a
result of microcontroller performance that
has risen considerably in the last few years. 

In contrast with diesel-engine vehicles with

conventional mechanically controlled fuel-
injection pumps, the driver of a vehicle
equipped with EDC has no direct control
over the injected fuel quantity via the acceler-
ator pedal and cable. The injected fuel quan-
tity is actually determined by a number of
different influencing variables. They include:
(cid:0) The vehicle response desired by the driver

(accelerator-pedal position)
(cid:0) The engine operating status
(cid:0) The engine temperature
(cid:0) Interventions by other systems (e.g. TCS)
(cid:0) The effect on exhaust-gas emission levels,

etc.

The control unit calculates the injected fuel
quantity on the basis of all these influencing
variables. Start of delivery can also be varied.
This demands a comprehensive monitoring
concept that detects inconsistencies and initi-
ates appropriate actions in accordance with
the effects (e.g. torque limitation or limp-

home mode in the idle-speed range). EDC,
therefore incorporates a number of control
loops.

Electronic diesel control allows data exchange
with other electronic systems, such as the
Traction Control System (TCS), Electronic
Transmission Control (ETC), or Electronic
Stability Program (ESP). As a result, the en-
gine management system can be integrated in
the vehicle’s overall control system network,
thereby enabling functions such as reduction
of engine torque when the automatic trans-
mission changes gear, regulation of engine
torque to compensate for wheel spin, dis-
abling of fuel injection by the engine immo-
bilizer, etc. 

The EDC system is fully integrated in the
vehicle’s diagnostic system. It meets all OBD 
(On-Board Diagnosis) and EOBD (European
OBD) requirements.

System modules
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) is divided
into three system modules (Fig. 1):

1. Sensors and setpoint generators detect
 operating conditions (e.g. engine speed) 
and setpoint values (e.g. switch position).
They convert physical variables into electrical
 signals.

2. The electronic control unit processes data
from the sensors and setpoint generators
based on specific open- and closed-loop con-
trol algorithms. It controls the actuators by
means of electrical output signals. In addi-
tion, the control unit acts as an interface to
other systems and to the vehicle diagnostic
system.

3. Actuators convert electrical output signals
from the control unit into mechanical para-
meters (e.g. the solenoid valve for the fuel-
injection system).

Where does t he word “electronics” come from?

(cid:0)

Where does the word “electronics” come from?

This term actually goes back to the ancient
Greeks. For them, the word “electron” meant
amber. Its force of attraction on woollen
threads or similar was known to Thales von
Milet over 2,500 years ago. 

Electrons, and therefore electronics as such,
are extremely fast due to their very small mass
and electric charge. The term “electronics”
comes directly from the word “electron”.

The mass of an electron has as little effect
on a gram of any given substance as a 5 gram
weight has on the total mass of our earth. 

The word “electronics” was born in the
20th century. There is no evidence available
as to when the word was used for the first
time. It could be Sir John Ambrose Fleming,
one of the inventors of the electron tube in
about 1902.

Even the first “Electronic Engineer” already
 existed in the 19th century. Fleming was listed
in the 1888 edition of “Who’s Who”, pub-
lished during the reign of Queen Victoria. The
official title was “Kelly’s Handbook of Titled,
Landed and Official Classes”. The Electronic
Engineer can be found under the title “Royal
Warrant Holders”, that is the list of persons
who had been awarded a Royal Warrant. 

What was this Electronic Engineer’s job?
He was responsible for the correct functioning
and cleanliness of the gas lamps at court. 
And why did he have such a splendid title?
Because he knew that “electrons” in ancient
Greece stood for glitter, shine, and sparkle.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Data processing

The required degree of accuracy together
with the diesel engine’s outstanding dynamic
response requires high-level computing
power. The output signals trigger output
stages that supply sufficient power for the ac-
tuators (e.g. high-pressure solenoid valves for
the fuel-injection system, exhaust-gas recircu-
lation positioners, and boost-pressure actua-
tors). Apart from this, a number of other aux-
iliary-function components (e.g. glow relay
and air-conditioning system) are triggered.

Faulty signal characteristics are detected by
output-stage diagnostic functions for the
 solenoid valves. Furthermore, signals are
 exchanged with other systems in the vehicle
via the interfaces. The engine ECU monitors
the complete fuel-injection system as part of
a safety strategy.

Data processing

The main function of the Electronic Diesel
Control (EDC) is to control the injected fuel
quantity and the injection timing. The com-
mon-rail fuel-injection system also controls
injection pressure. Furthermore, on all sys-
tems, the engine ECU controls a number 
of actuators. For all components to operate
efficiently, the EDC functions must be pre-
cisely matched to every vehicle and every
 engine. This is the only way to optimize com-
ponent interaction (Fig. 2).

The control unit evaluates the signals sent by
the sensors and limits them to the permitted
voltage level. Some input signals are also
checked for plausibility. Using these input
data together with stored program maps, the
microprocessor calculates injection timing
and its duration. This information is then
converted to a signal characteristic which 
is aligned to the engine’s piston strokes. 
This calculation program is termed the “ECU
software”.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Fuel-injection control

Fuel-injection control

An overview of the various control functions
which are possible with the EDC control
units is given in Table 1. Fig. 1 opposite shows
the sequence of fuel-injection calculations
with all functions, a number of which are
special options. These can be activated in the
ECU by the workshop when retrofit equip-
ment is installed.

In order that the engine can run with optimal
combustion under all operating conditions,
the ECU calculates exactly the right injected
fuel quantity for all conditions. Here, a num-
ber of parameters must be taken into ac-
count. On a number of solenoid-valve-con-
trolled distributor pumps, the sol-enoid
valves for injected fuel quantity and start of
injection are triggered by a separate pump
ECU (PSG).

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Start quantity
For starting, the injected fuel quantity is cal-
culated as a function of coolant temperature
and cranking speed. Start-quantity signals are
generated from the moment the starting
switch is turned (Fig. 1, switch in “Start” posi-
tion) until a given minimum engine speed is
reached. 

The driver cannot influence the start quan-

tity.

Drive mode
When the vehicle is being driven normally,
the injected fuel quantity is a function of the
accelerator-pedal setting (accelerator-pedal
sensor) and of the engine speed (Fig. 1,
switch in “Drive” position). Calculation
 depends upon maps which also take other in-
fluences into account (e. g. fuel and intake-air
temperature). This permits best-possible
alignment of the engine’s output to the dri-
ver’s wishes.

Idle-speed control
The function of idle speed control (LLR) is to
regulate a specific setpoint speed at idle when
the accelerator pedal is not operated. This can
vary depending on the engine’s particular op-
erating mode. For instance, with the engine
cold, the idle speed is usually set higher than
when it is hot. There are further instances
when the idle speed is held somewhat
higher. For instance, when the  vehicle’s electri-
cal-system voltage is too low, when the air-
conditioning system is switched on, or when
the vehicle is freewheeling. When the vehicle is
driven in stop-and-go traffic, together with
stops at traffic lights, the engine runs a lot of
the time at idle. Considerations concerning
emissions and fuel consumption dictate,
therefore, that idle speed should be kept as
low as possible. This, of course, is a disadvan-
tage with respect to smooth-running and
pulling away.

When adjusting the stipulated idle speed, the
idle-speed control must cope with heavily
fluctuating requirements. The input power
needed by the engine-driven auxiliary equip-
ment varies considerably. 

At low electrical-system voltages, for in-

stance, the alternator consumes far more
power than it does when the voltages are
higher. In addition, the power demands from
the A/C compressor, the steering pump, and
the high-pressure generation for the diesel in-
jection system must all be taken into account.
Added to these external load moments is the
engine’s internal friction torque which is
highly dependent on engine temperature, and
must also be compensated for by the idle-
speed control.

In order to regulate the desired idle speed, the
controller continues to adapt the injected fuel
quantity until the actual engine speed corre-
sponds to the desired idle speed. 

Maximum-rpm control
The maximum-rpm control ensures that 
the engine does not run at excessive speeds.
To avoid damage to the engine, the engine
manufacturer stipulates a permissible maxi-
mum speed which may only be exceeded for a
very brief period.

Above the rated-power operating point, 
the maximum-speed governor reduces the in-
jected fuel quantity continuously, until just
above the maximum-speed point when fuel-
injection stops completely. In order 
to prevent engine surge, a ramp function 
is used to ensure that the drop-off in fuel
 injection is not too abrupt. This is all the
more difficult to implement, the closer the
nominal performance point and maximum
engine speed are to each other. 

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

235

Intermediate-speed control
Intermediate-speed control (ZDR) is used on
commercial vehicles and light-duty trucks
with power take-offs, e.g. crane), or for special
vehicles (e.g. ambulances with a power gener-
ator). With the control in operation, the en-
gine is regulated to a load-independent inter-
mediate speed. 

With the vehicle stationary, the intermedi-
ate-speed control is activated via the cruise-
control operator unit. A fixed rotational
speed can be called up from the data store at
the push of a button. In addition, this opera-
tor unit can be used for preselecting specific
engine speeds. The intermediate-speed con-
trol is also applied on passenger cars with au-
tomated transmissions (e.g. Tiptronic) to
control the engine speed during gearshifts.

Vehicle-speed controller 
(cruise control)
Cruise control allows the vehicle to be driven
at a constant speed. It controls the vehicle
speed to the speed selected by the driver with-
out him/her needing to press the accelerator
pedal. The driver can set the required speed
either by operating a lever or by pressing but-
tons on the steering wheel. The injected fuel
quantity is either increased or  decreased until
the desired (set) speed is reached. 

On some cruise-control applications, the ve-
hicle can be accelerated beyond the current
set speed by pressing the accelerator pedal. As
soon as the accelerator pedal is  released,
cruise control regulates the speed back down
to the previously set speed.

If the driver depresses the clutch or brake
pedal while cruise control is activated, control
is terminated. On some applications, the con-
trol can be switched off by the accelerator
pedal.

If cruise control has been switched off, the
driver only needs to shift the lever to the
 restore position to reselect the last speed
 setting. 

The operator controls can also be used for a
step-by-step change of the selected speed.

Vehicle-speed limiter
Variable limitation
Vehicle-speed limitation (FGB, also called the
limiter) limits the maximum speed to 
a set value, even if the driver continues to de-
press the accelerator pedal. On very quiet ve-
hicles, where the engine can hardly be heard,
this is a particular help for the driver who can
no longer exceed speed limits inadvertently.

The vehicle-speed limiter keeps the injected
fuel quantity down to a limit corresponding
to the selected maximum speed. It can be de-
activated by pressing the lever or depressing
the kickdown switch. In order to reselect the
last speed setting, the driver only needs to
press the lever to the restore position. 
The operator controls can also be used for 
a step-by-step change of the selected speed.

Fixed limitation
In a number of countries, fixed maximum
speeds are mandatory for certain classes of
vehicles (for instance, for heavy trucks). Vehi-
cle manufacturers also limit the maximum
speeds of their heavy vehicles by installing 
a fixed speed limit which cannot be deacti-
vated.

In the case of special vehicles, the driver 
can also select from a range of fixed, pro-
grammed speed limits (for instance, when
workers are standing on the platform of a
garbage truck).

236

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Active-surge damping
Sudden engine-torque changes excite the ve-
hicle’s drivetrain, which, as a result, goes into
bucking oscillation. These oscillations are
perceived by the vehicle’s occupants as un-
pleasant periodic changes in acceleration
(Fig. 2, a). The function of the active-surge
damper (ARD) is to reduce these changes in
acceleration (b). 
Two different methods are used:
(cid:0) In case of sudden changes in the torque re-
quired by the driver (through the accelera-
tor pedal), a precisely matched filter func-
tion reduces drivetrain excitation (1).
(cid:0) The speed signals are used to detect drive-
train oscillations which are then damped
by an active control. In order to counteract
the drivetrain oscillations (2), the  active
control reduces the injected fuel quantity
when rotational speed increases, and in-
creases it when speed drops. 

Smooth-running control (SRC)/
Control of injected-fuel-quantity
 compensation (MAR)
Presuming a constant injection duration, 
not all of the engine’s cylinders generate the
same torque. This can be due to differences in
cylinder-head sealing, as well as differences 
in cylinder friction, and hydraulic- injection
components. These differences in torque out-
put lead to rough engine running and an in-
crease in exhaust-gas emissions. 

Smooth-running control (LRR) or fuel-
 balancing control (MAR) have the function
of detecting these differences based on the 
resulting fluctuations in engine speed, and 
to compensate by adjusting the injected fuel
quantity in the cylinder affected. Here, the 
rotational speed at a given cylinder after in-
jection is compared to a mean speed. If the
particular cylinder’s speed is too low, the in-
jected fuel quantity is increased; if it is too
high, the fuel quantity is reduced (Fig. 3).

Fuel-injection control

237

Altitude compensation
Atmospheric pressure drops as altitude in-
creases so that the cylinder is charged with less
combustion air. This means that the injected
fuel quantity must be reduced accordingly,
otherwise excessive soot will be emitted. 
In order that the injected fuel quantity can 
be reduced at high altitudes, the atmospheric
pressure is measured by the ambient-pressure
sensor in the ECU. This reduces the injected
fuel quantity at higher elevations. Atmospheric
pressure also has an effect on boost-pressure
control and torque limitation.

Cylinder shutoff
If less torque is required at high engine
speeds, very little fuel needs to be injected. As
an alternative, cylinder shutoff can be  applied
to reduce torque. Here, half of the injectors
are switched off (commercial-vehicle UIS,
UPS, and CRS). The remaining injectors then
inject correspondingly more fuel which can
be metered with even higher precision.

When the injectors are switched on and off,

special software algorithms ensure smooth
transitions without noticeable torque
changes.

Smooth-running control is a convenience fea-
ture. Its primary object is to ensure that the
engine runs smoothly at near-idle. The in-
jected-fuel-quantity compensation function
is aimed at not only improving comfort at
idle, but also at reducing exhaust-gas emis-
sions in the medium-speed ranges by ensur-
ing identical injected fuel quantities for all
cylinders. 

On commercial vehicles, smooth-running
control is also known as the AZG (adaptive
cylinder equalization).

Injected-fuel-quantity limit
There are a number of reasons why the fuel
quantity actually required by the driver, or
that which is physically possible, should not
always be injected. The injection of such fuel
quantities could have the following effects:
(cid:0) Excessive exhaust-gas emissions
(cid:0) Excessive soot
(cid:0) Mechanical overloading due to high torque

or excessive engine speed 

(cid:0) Thermal overloading due to excessive tem-
peratures of the exhaust gas, coolant, oil, or
turbocharger

(cid:0) Thermal overloading of the solenoid valves

if they are triggered too long

To avoid these negative effects, a number 
of input variables (for instance, intake-air
quantity, engine speed, and coolant tempera-
ture) are used to generate this limitation fig-
ure. The result is that the maximum injected
fuel quantity is limited and with it the maxi-
mum torque.

Engine-brake function
When a truck’s engine brake is applied, the
injected fuel quantity is either reduced to
zero, or the idle fuel quantity is injected. For
this purpose, the ECU detects the position of
the engine-brake switch.

238

Electronic diesel control

Fuel-injection control

Injector delivery compensation
New functions are added to common-rail
(CR) and UIS/UPS systems to enhance the
high precision of the fuel-injection system
further, and ensure them for the service life 
of the vehicle.

With injector delivery compensation

(IMA), a mass of measuring data is detected
for each injector during the injector manu-
facturing process. The data is then affixed 
to the injector in the form of a data-matrix
code. With piezo-inline injectors, data on lift
response is included. This data is transferred
to the ECU during vehicle production. While
the engine is running, these values are used to
compensate for deviations in metering and
switching response.

Zero delivery calibration
The reliable mastery of small pre-injection
events for the service life of the vehicle is
 vitally important to achieve the required level
of comfort (through reduced noise) and ex-
haust-gas emission targets. There must be
some form of compensation for fuel-quantity
drifts in the injectors. For this  reason, a small
quantity of fuel is injected in one cylinder in
overrun conditions in  second- and third-gen-
eration CR systems. The wheel-speed sensor
detects the resulting torque increase as a mi-
nor dynamic change in engine speed. This in-
crease in torque, which remains imperceptible
to the driver, is clearly linked to the injected
fuel quantity. The process is then repeated for
all cylinders and at various operating points.
A teach-in algorithm detects minor changes
in pre- injection quantity and corrects the in-
jector triggering period accordingly for all
pre- injection events.

Average delivery adaption
The deviation of the actually injected fuel
quantity from the setpoint value is required
to adapt exhaust-gas recirculation and
charge-air pressure correctly. The average de-
livery adaption (MMA), therefore determines
the average value of the injected fuel quantity
for all cylinders from the signals received
from the lambda oxygen sensor and the air-
mass sensor. Correction values are then calcu-
lated from the setpoint and actual values (see
“Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-
car diesel engines”). 

The MMA teach-in function ensures a con-

stant level of favorable exhaust-gas emission
values in the lower part-load range for the
service life of the vehicle.

Pressure-wave correction
Injection events trigger pressure waves in the
line between the nozzle and the fuel rail in all
CR systems. These pressure pulses affect sys-
tematically the injected fuel quantity of later
injection events (pre-injection/main injec-
tion/secondary injection) within a combus-
tion cycle. The deviations of later  injection
events are dependent on the fuel quantity
previously injected, the time interval between
injection events, rail pressure, and fuel tem-
perature. The control unit can calculate a cor-
rection factor by including these parameters
in suitable compensation algorithms.

However, extremely high application re-
sources are required for this correction func-
tion. The benefit is the possibility of flexibly
adjusting the interval between pre-injection
and main injection, for example, in order to
optimize combustion.

Injector delivery compensation

Functional description 
Injector delivery compensation (IMA) is a soft-
ware function to make fuel quantity metering
more precise and increase injector efficiency
on the engine. The feature has the function of
correcting injected fuel quantity to the setpoint
value over the entire program map individually
for every injector in a CR system. This re-
duces system tolerances and exhaust-gas
emission spread. The compensation values
 required for IMA represent the difference from
the setpoint value of each factory test point,
and are inscribed on each injector in encoded
form. 

The entire engine environment is corrected

by means of a correction program map that
uses compensation values to calculate a cor-
rection quantity. At the end of the line of the
car assembly plant, the EDC compensation
values belonging to the injectors fitted and
their cylinder assignment are programmed in
the electronic control unit using EOL program-
ming. The compensation values are also re-
programmed when an injector is replaced at
the customer service workshop.

Necessity for this function
The technical resources required for a further
restriction of the manufacturing tolerances for
injectors rise exponentially and appear to be
 financially unprofitable. IMA is a viable solution
to increase efficiency, enhance the metering
precision of fuel quantity injected in the en-
gine, and reduce exhaust-gas emissions.

Measured values in testing
The end-of-line test measures every injector at
several points that are representative for the
spread of the particular injector type. Devia-
tions from setpoint values at these points
(compensation values) are calculated and
then inscribed on the injector head.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Fuel-injection control

Closed-loop control using the
needle-motion sensor
The inductive needle-motion sensor is fitted
in an injection nozzle (reference nozzle, usu-
ally cylinder 1). When the needle opens (and
closes) the sensor transmits a pulse (Fig. 4).
The needle-opening signal is used by the ECU
as confirmation of the start of injection. This
means that inside a closed control loop the
start of injection can be precisely aligned to
the desired value for the particular operating
point.

The needle-motion sensor’s untreated signal
is amplified and interference-suppressed
 before being converted to precision square-
wave pulses which can be used to mark the
start of injection for a reference cylinder.

The ECU controls the actuator mechanism

for the start of injection (for in-line pumps
the solenoid actuator, and for distributor
pumps the timing-device solenoid valve) 
so that the actual start of injection  always
corresponds to the desired/setpoint start of
injection.

Start-of-injection control
The start of injection has a critical effect 
on power output, fuel consumption, noise,
and emissions. The desired value for start 
of injection depends on engine speed and 
injected fuel quantity, and it is stored in the
ECU in special maps. Adaptation is possible
as a function of coolant temperature and 
ambient pressure.

Tolerances in manufacture and in the
pump mounting on the engine, together 
with changes in the solenoid valve during 
its lifetime, can lead to slight differences in
the solenoid-valve switching times which 
in turn lead to different starts of injection.
The response behaviour of the nozzle-and-
holder assembly also changes over the course
of time. Fuel density and temperature also
have an effect upon start of injection. This
must be compensated for by some form of
control strategy in order to stay within the
prescribed emissions limits. 
The following closed-loop controls are
 employed (Table 2):

The start-of-injection signal can only be eval-
uated when fuel is being injected and when
the engine speed is stable. During starting
and overrun (no fuel injection), the needle-
motion sensor cannot provide a signal which
is good enough for evaluation. This means
that the start-of-injection control loop can-
not be closed because there is no signal avail-
able confirming the start-of-injection.

In-line fuel-injection pumps
On in-line pumps, a special digital current
controller improves the control’s accuracy
and dynamic response by aligning the current
to the start-of-injection controller’s  setpoint
value practically without any delay at all.

In order to ensure start-of-injection accu-
racy in open-loop-controlled operation too,
the start-of-delivery solenoid in the control-
sleeve actuator mechanism is calibrated to
compensate for the effects of tolerances. The
current controller compensates for the effects
of the temperature-dependent solen-oid-
winding resistance. All these measures ensure
that the setpoint value for current as derived
from the start map leads to the correct stroke
of the start-of-delivery solenoid and to the
correct start of injection. 

Start-of-delivery control using the
 incremental angle/time signal (IWZ)
On the solenoid-valve-controlled distributor
pumps (VP30, VP44), the start of injection is
also very accurate even without the help of a
needle-motion sensor. This high level of ac-
curacy was achieved by applying positioning
control to the timing device inside the dis-
tributor pump. This form of closed-loop con-
trol serves to control the start of delivery and
is referred to as start-of-delivery control. Start
of delivery and start of injection have a cer-
tain relationship to each other and this is
stored in the so-called wave-propagation-time
map in the engine ECU.

The signal from the crankshaft-speed sensor
and the signal from the incremental angle/
time system (IWZ signal) inside the pump,
are used as the input variables for the timing-
device positioning control.

The IWZ signal is generated inside the pump
by the rotational-speed or angle-of-rotation
sensor (1) on the trigger wheel (2) attached to
the driveshaft. The sensor shifts along with
the timing device (4) which, when it changes
position, also changes the position of the
tooth gap (3) relative to the TDC pulse of the
crankshaft-speed sensor. The angle between
the tooth gap, or the synchronization pulse
generated by the tooth gap, and the TDC
pulse is continually registered by the pump
ECU and compared with the stored reference
value. The difference between the two angles
represents the timing device’s actual position,
and this is continually compared with its set-
point/desired position. If the timing-device
position deviates, the triggering signal for the
timing-device solenoid valve is changed until
actual and setpoint position coincide with
each other.

Since all cylinders are taken into account, the
advantage of this form of start-of-delivery
control lies in the system’s rapid response. It
has a further advantage in that it also func-
tions during overrun when no fuel injection

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Fuel-injection control

takes place which means that the timing de-
vice can be preset for when the next injection
event occurs.

In case even more severe demands are made

on the accuracy of the start of injection, the
start-of-delivery control can have an optional
start-of-injection control with needle-motion
sensor superimposed upon it.

BIP control
BIP control is used with the solenoid-valve-
controlled Unit Injector System (UIS) and
Unit Pump System (UPS). The start of deliv-
ery – or BIP (Begin of Injection Period) – is
defined as the instant in time in which the 
solenoid closes. As from this point, pressure
buildup starts in the pump high-pressure
chamber. The nozzle opens as soon as the
nozzle-opening pressure is exceeded, and in-
jection can commence (start of injection).
Fuel metering takes place between start of de-
livery and end of solenoid-valve triggering.
This period is termed the delivery  period.

Since there is a direct connection between
the start of delivery and the start of injection,
all that is needed for the precise control of 
the start of injection is information on the 
instant of the start of delivery.

So as to avoid having to apply additional
sensor technology (for instance, a needle-mo-
tion sensor), electronic evaluation of the sole-
noid-valve current is used in detecting the
start of delivery. Around the expected  instant
of closing of the solenoid valve, constant-
voltage triggering is used (BIP window, Fig. 6,
1). The inductive effects when the solenoid
valve closes result in the curve having a spe-
cific characteristic which is registered and
evaluated by the ECU. For each injection
event, the deviation of the solenoid-valve
closing point from the theoretical setpoint is
registered and stored, and applied for the fol-
lowing injection sequence as a compensation
value.

If the BIP signal should fail, the ECU changes
over to open-loop control.

Shutoff
The auto-ignition principle of operation
means that in order to stop the diesel engine
it is only necessary to cut off its supply of
fuel. 

With EDC (Electronic Diesel Control), the

engine is switched off due to the ECU out-
putting the signal “Fuel quantity zero” (that
is, the solenoid valves are no longer triggered,
or the control rack is moved back to the zero-
delivery setting).

There are also a number of redundant (sup-
plementary) shutoff paths (for instance, the
electrical shutoff valve (ELAB) on the port-
and-helix controlled distributor pumps).

The UIS and UPS are intrinsically safe, and
the worst thing that can happen is that one
single unwanted injection takes place. Here,
therefore, supplementary shutoff paths are
not needed.

Further special adaptations

243

Further special adaptations

In addition to those described here, EDC 
permits a wide range of other functions. 
For instance, these include:

Drive recorder
On commercial vehicles, the Drive Recorder is
used to record the engine’s operating condi-
tions (for instance, how long was the vehicle
driven, under what temperatures and loads,
and at what engine speeds). This data is used
in drawing up an overview of operational
conditions from which, for instance, individ-
ual service intervals can be calculated.

Special application engineering for
competition trucks
On race trucks, the 160 km/h maximum
speed may be exceeded by no more than
2 km/h. On the other hand, this speed must
be reached as soon as possible. This necessi-
tates special adaptation of the ramp function
for the vehicle-speed limiter.

(cid:0)

Racing trucks

The diesel engines and fuel-injection systems
for trucks tuned for racing – also known as
racing trucks – are adapted to the specials
 requirements of racing sport. For instance, 
the engine of a production truck with a power
output of about 300 kW (410 bhp) is increased
by a factor of 3.7 to about 110 kW
(1,500 bhp)! This means higher engine
revs, greater cylinder charges (air mass),
and therefore larger injected-fuel quantities
within shorter periods of time.

During the races, the engines are

 driven within the range of (cid:0) = 1.
It means even greater injected-
fuel quantities, and this re-
quires larger plunger-and-
 barrel assemblies and special
nozzles. Even the injection
cams – if fitted – must have 
a more pointed shape.

Adaptations for off-highway vehicles
Such vehicles include diesel locomotives, rail
cars, construction machinery, agricultural
machinery, boats and ships. In such applica-
tions, the diesel engine(s) is/are far more
 often run in the full-load range than is the
case with road vehicles (90% full-load opera-
tion compared with 30%). The power output
of such engines must therefore be reduced in
order to ensure an adequate service life.

The mileage figures which are often used as
the basis for the service interval on road vehi-
cles are not available for such equipment as
agricultural or construction machinery, and
in any case if they were available they would
have no useful significance. Instead, the Drive
Recorder data is used here.

Just as in a production vehicle, the electronic
systems have the task of providing highly pre-
cise control. Exact maintenance of the maximum
speed requires special features when it comes
to speed-regulation breakaway. In all other as-
pects, the Electronic Diesel Control (EDC) is
identical
to pro-
duction
models.

Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-car diesel engines

Lambda closed-loop control
for passenger-car diesel
 engines
Application
The lawmakers are continually increasing the
severity of legislation governing exhaust-gas
emission limits for cars powered by diesel en-
gines. Apart from the measures taken to opti-
mize the engine’s internal combustion, the
open and closed-loop control of functions re-
lated to exhaust-gas emissions are continuing
to gain in importance. Introduction of
lambda closed-loop control offers major po-
tential for reducing emission-value spread in
diesel engines.

A broadband lambda oxygen sensor in the ex-
haust pipe (Fig. 1, 7) measures the residual
oxygen content in the exhaust gas. 
This is an indicator of the A/F ratio (excess-
air-factor lambda λ). The lambda oxygen-
sensor signal is adapted while the engine is
running. This ensures a high level of signal
accuracy throughout the sensor’s service life.
The lambda oxygen-sensor signal is used as
the basis for a number of lambda functions,
which will be described in more detail in the
following.

Lambda closed-loop control circuits are used
to regenerate NOX accumulator-type catalytic
converters.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-car diesel engines

245

Lambda closed-loop control is designed for
all passenger-car fuel-injection systems with
engine control units dating dating from the
EDC16 generation.

Basic functions
Pressure compensation
The unprocessed lambda oxygen-sensor
 signal is dependent on the oxygen concentra-
tion in the exhaust gas and the exhaust-gas
pressure at the sensor installation point. The
influence of pressure on the sensor  signal
must, therefore, be compensated.

The pressure-compensation function incorpo-
rates two program maps, one for exhaust-gas
pressure, and one for pressure dependence 
of the lambda oxygen-sensor output signal.
These two maps are used to correct the sensor
output signal with reference to the particular
operating point.

Adaption
In overrun mode (trailing throttle), lambda
oxygen-sensor adaption takes into account
the deviation of the measured oxygen con-
centration from the fresh-air oxygen concen-
tration (approx. 21%). As a result, the system
“learns” a correction value which is used at
every engine operating point to correct the
measured oxygen concentration. This leads to
a precise, drift-compensated lambda output
signal for the service life of the lambda oxy-
gen sensor.

Lambda-based EGR control
Compared with air-mass-based exhaust-gas
recirculation, detecting oxygen concentration
in the exhaust gas allows tighter emission 
tolerance bands for an automotive manufac-
turer’s entire vehicle fleet. For  future limits,
an emission advantage of  approx. 10...20%
can be gained in this way for the exhaust-gas
test.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-car diesel engines

Average delivery adaption
Average delivery adaption supplies a precise
injection quantity signal to form the setpoint
for the exhaust-gas-related closed  control
loop. Correction of exhaust-gas  recirculation
plays a major role in emissions here. Average
delivery adaption operates in the lower part-
load range and determines the average devia-
tion in the injected fuel quantity of all cylin-
ders.

Fig. 2 (previous page) shows the basic struc-
ture of average delivery adaption and its in-
fluence on the exhaust-gas-related closed
control loops.

The lambda oxygen-sensor signal and the air-
mass signal are used to calculate the  actually
injected fuel mass, which is then compared to
the desired injected fuel mass. Differences are
stored in an adaption map in defined “learn-
ing points”. This procedure ensures that,
when the operating point  requires an injected
fuel quantity correction, it can be imple-

mented without delay even during dynamic
changes of state.

These correction quantities are stored in 
the EEPROM of the ECU and are available
immediately the engine is started.

Basically speaking, there are two average-
 delivery adaption operating modes. They dif-
fer in the way they apply detected deviations
in injected fuel quantity:

Operating mode: Indirect Control
In Indirect Control mode (Fig. 2), a precise in-
jection quantity setpoint is used as the input
variable in various exhaust-gas-related refer-
ence program maps. The injected fuel quan-
tity is not corrected during the fuel-metering
process.

Lambda closed-loop control for passenger-car diesel engines

247

Operating mode: Direct Control
In Direct Control mode, the quantity devia-
tion is used in the metering process to correct
the injected fuel quantity so that the  actual
fuel quantity injected coincides more pre-
cisely with the reference injected fuel quan-
tity. In this case, this is (more or less) a closed
quantity control loop.

Full-load smoke limitation
Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the control
structure for full-load smoke limitation using
a lambda oxygen sensor. The objective here is
to determine the maximum fuel quantity
which may be injected without  exceeding a
given smoke-emission value.

The signals from the air-mass meter and 
the engine-speed sensor are applied together
with a smoke-limitation map to determine the
desired air/fuel ratio value λdesired. This, in
turn, is applied together with the air mass to
calculate the precontrol value for the maxi-
mum permissible injected fuel quantity.

This form of control is already in serial pro-
duction, and has a lambda closed-loop control
imposed on it. The lambda controller calcu-
lates a correction fuel quantity from the dif-
ference between the desired air/fuel ratio λde-
sired and the actual air/fuel ratio value λactual.
The maximum full-load injected fuel quantity
is the total of the pilot-control quantity and
the correction quantity.

This control architecture permits a high level
of dynamic response due to pilot  control, and
improved precision due to the  superimposed
lambda control loop.

Detection of undesirable combustion
The lambda oxygen sensor signal helps to de-
tect the occurrence of undesirable combus-
tion in overrun mode. It is detected if the
lambda oxygen-sensor signal drops below a
calculated threshold. In this case, the engine
can be switched off by closing a control flap
and the EGR valve. The detection of undesir-
able combustion represents an additional 
engine safeguard function.

Summary
A lambda-based exhaust-gas recirculation
system can substantially reduce emission-
value spread over a manufacturer’s vehicle
fleet due to production tolerances or aging
drift. This is achieved by using average deliv-
ery adaption.

Average delivery adaption supplies a precise
injection quantity signal to form the setpoint
for the exhaust-gas-related closed control
loop. The precision of these control loops is
increased as a result. Correction of exhaust-
gas recirculation plays the major role on emis-
sions here.

In addition, the application of lambda closed-
loop control permits the precise  metering of
the full-load smoke quantity and detection of
undesirable combustion in overrun (trailing
throttle) mode.

Furthermore, the lambda oxygen sensor’s
high-precision signal can be used in a lambda
closed control loop to regenerate NOX cat-
alytic converters.

Closed-loop and open-loop control

(cid:0)

Closed-loop and open-loop control

Application
The closed-loop and open-loop control appli-
cations are of vital importance for various 
on-board systems. 

The term (open-loop) control is used in
many cases, not only for the process of con-
trolling, but also for the entire system in which
control takes place (for this reason, the gen-
eral term “control unit” is used, although it
may perform a closed-loop control function).
Accordingly, arithmetic processes run in con-
trol units to calculate both closed-loop and
open-loop functions. 

Closed-loop control
Closed-loop control is a process in which a
parameter (controlled variable x) is detected
continuously, compared to another parameter
(reference variable w1), and adapted to the
 reference variable in an adjustment process
depending on the result of the comparison.
The resulting action takes place in a closed
circuit (closed control loop).

Closed-loop control has the function of
 adjusting the value of controlled variables to a
value specified by a reference variable, despite
any disturbance influences that may occur. 
The closed control loop (Fig. 1a) is a

closed-loop control circuit with a discrete ac-
tion. Controlled variable x acts within a loop
configuration in a form of negative feedback.
Contrary to open-loop control, closed-loop
control considers the impact of all disturbance

values (z1, z2) occurring within the control
loop. Examples of closed-loop systems in a
vehicle:
(cid:1) Lambda closed-loop control
(cid:1) Idle-speed control
(cid:1) ABS/TSC/ESP control
(cid:1) Air conditioning (interior temperature)

Open-loop control
Open-loop control is the process within a sys-
tem in which one or several parameters act as
input variables affecting other parameters due
to intrinsic laws governing the system. A fea-
ture of open-loop control is the open action
sequence across an individual transfer ele-
ment or the open control loop.

An open control loop (Fig. 1b) is an

arrangement of elements that interact on each
other in a loop structure. It may interact in any
possible way with other systems as an entity
within a higher-level system. The open control
loop can only counter the impact of a distur-
bance value measured by the control unit
(e.g. z1); other disturbance values (e.g. z2) 
may act unimpaired. Examples of open-loop
systems in a vehicle:

sure-wave correction for calculating injected

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Torque-controlled EDC systems

249

Torque-controlled 
EDC systems

The engine-management system is continu-
ally being integrated more closely into the
overall vehicle system. Through the CAN bus,
vehicle dynamics systems such as TCS, and
comfort and convenience systems such as
cruise control, have a direct influence on the
Electronic Diesel Control (EDC). Apart from
this, much of the information registered
and/or calculated in or by the engine man-
agement system must be passed on to other
ECUs through the CAN bus.

In order to be able to incorporate the EDC
even more efficiently in a functional alliance
with other ECUs, and implement other
changes rapidly and effectively, it was neces-
sary to make far-reaching changes to the
newest-generation controls. These changes 
resulted in the torque-controlled EDC which
was introduced with the EDC16. The main
feature is the changeover of the module
 interfaces to the parameters, as commonly 
encountered in practice in the vehicle.

Engine parameters
Essentially, an IC engine’s output can be de-
fined using the three parameters: power P,
engine speed n, and torque M. 

For 2 diesel engines. Fig. 1 compares typical

curves of torque and power as a function of
engine speed. Basically speaking, the follow-
ing equation applies:

P = 2 · π · n · M

In other words, it suffices to use the torque as
the reference (command) variable. Engine
power then results from the above equation.
Since power output cannot be measured di-
rectly, torque has turned out to be a suitable
reference (command) variable for engine
management.

Torque control
When accelerating, the driver uses the accel-
erator pedal (sensor) to directly demand a

given torque from the engine. At the same
time, but independent of the driver’s require-
ments, via the interfaces other vehicle systems
submit torque demands resulting from the
power requirements of the particular compo-
nent (e.g. air conditioner, alternator). Using
these torque-requirement inputs, the engine
management calculates the output torque to
be generated by the engine and controls the
fuel-injection and air-system actuators ac-
cordingly. This method has the following 
advantages:
(cid:0) No single system (for instance, boost pres-
sure, fuel injection, pre-glow) has a direct
effect on engine management. This enables
the engine management to also take into
account higher-level optimization criteria
(such as exhaust-gas emissions and fuel
consumption) when processing external 
requirements, and thus control the  engine
in the most efficient manner,

(cid:0) Many of the functions which do not di-
rectly concern the engine management 
can be designed to function identically 
for diesel and gasoline engines.

(cid:0) Extensions to the system can be imple-

mented quickly.

Elect ronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Torque-controlled EDC systems

Internal torque demands
At this stage, the idle-speed control and the
active surge damper intervene.

For instance, if demanded by the situation,

in order to prevent mechanical damage, or
excessive smoke due to the injection of too
much fuel, the torque limitation  reduces the
internal torque requirement. 
In contrast to the previous engine-manage-
ment systems, limitations are no longer only
applied to the injected fuel-quantity, but in-
stead, depending upon the required effects,
also to the particular physical quantity in-
volved.

The engine’s losses are also taken into

 account (e.g. friction, drive for the high-pres-
sure pump). The torque represents the en-
gine’s measurable effects to the outside. The
engine management, though, can only gener-
ate these effects in conjunction with the cor-
rect fuel injection together with the correct
injection point, and the necessary marginal
conditions as apply to the air-intake system
(e.g. boost pressure and EGR rate). The re-
quired injected fuel quantity is determined
using the current combustion efficiency. The
calculated fuel quantity is limited by a protec-
tive function (for instance, protection against
overheating), and if necessary can be varied
by Smooth-Running Control (SRC). During
engine start, the injected fuel quantity is not
determined by external inputs such as those 
from the driver, but rather by the separate
“start-quantity control” function.

Actuator triggering
Finally, the desired values for the injected fuel
quantity are used to generate the triggering
data for the injection pump and/or the injec-
tors, and for defining the optimum operating
point for the intake-air system.

Engine-management sequence
Fig. 2 shows (schematically) the processing of
the setpoint inputs in the engine ECU. In or-
der to be able to fulfill their assignments effi-
ciently, the engine management’s control
functions all require a wide range of sensor
signals and information from other ECUs in
the vehicle.

Propulsion torque
The driver’s input (that is, the signal from 
the accelerator-pedal sensor) is interpreted 
by the engine management as the request 
for a propulsive torque. The inputs from the
cruise control and the vehicle speed limiter
are processed in exactly the same manner. 
Following this selection of the desired
propulsive torque, should the situation arise,
the vehicle-dynamics system (TCS, ESP) in-
creases the desired torque value when there is
the danger of wheel lockup and decreases it
when the wheels show a tendency to spin.

Further external torque demands
The drivetrain’s torque adaptation must be
taken into account (drivetrain transmission
ratio). This is defined for the most part by the
ratio of the particular gear, or by the torque-
converter efficiency in the case of automatic
transmissions. On vehicles with an automatic-
gearbox, the transmission control stipulates
the torque requirement during the actual gear
shift. Apart from reducing the load on the
transmission, reduced torque at this point re-
sults in a comfortable, smooth gear shift. In
addition, the torque required by other engine-
powered units (for instance, air-conditioner
compressor, alternator, servo pump) is deter-
mined. This torque requirement is calculated
either by the units themselves or by the engine
management.

Calculation is based on unit power and ro-

tational speed, and the engine management
adds up the various torque requirements. The
vehicle’s drivability remains  unchanged de-
spite varying requirements from the auxiliary
units and changes in the engine’s operating
state.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Control and triggering of the remaining actuators

Control and triggering of the
remaining actuators

In addition to the fuel-injection components
themselves, EDC is responsible for the control
and triggering of a large number of other ac-
tuators. These are used for cylinder-charge
control, or for the control of engine cooling,
or are used in diesel-engine start-assist sys-
tems. Here too, as is the case with the closed-
loop control of injection, the inputs from
other systems (such as TCS) are taken into 
account.

A variety of different actuators are used,
depending upon the vehicle type, its area of
application and the type of fuel injection.
This chapter deals with a number of exam-
ples, and further actuators are covered in 
the Chapter “Actuators”.

A variety of different methods are used for
triggering:
(cid:0) The actuators are triggered directly from 

an output (driver) stage in the engine ECU
using appropriate signals (e.g. the EGR
valve).

(cid:0) If high currents are involved (for instance
for fan control), the ECU triggers a relay.

(cid:0) The engine ECU transfers signals to an

 independent ECU, which is then used to
trigger or control the remaining actuators
(for instance, for glow control).

The advantage of incorporating all engine-
control functions in the EDC ECU lies in the
fact that not only the injected fuel quantity
and instant of injection can be taken into
 account in the engine control concept, but
also other engine functions such as EGR and
boost-pressure control. This leads to a con-
siderable improvement in engine manage-
ment. Apart from this, the engine ECU has 
a vast amount of information at its disposal
as needed for other functions (for instance,
engine and intake-air temperature as used for
glow control on the diesel engine).

Auxiliary coolant heating
High-performance diesel engines are very ef-
ficient, and under certain circumstances do
not generate enough waste heat to adequately
heat the vehicle’s interior. One solution for
overcoming this problem is to install auxiliary
coolant heating using glow plugs. Depending
upon the power available from the alternator,
this system is triggered in a number of steps.
It is controlled by the  engine ECU as used for
EDC.

Intake-duct switch-off
In the lower engine-rpm ranges and at idle, 
a flap (Fig. 1, 6) operated by an electropneu-
matic transducer closes one of the intake
ducts (5). Fresh air in then only inducted
through the turbulence duct (2). This leads 
to improved air turbulence in the lower rpm
ranges which in turn results in more efficient
combustion. In the higher rpm ranges, the
engine’s volumetric efficiency is improved
thanks to the open intake duct (5) and the
power output increases as a result.

Control and triggering of the remaining actuators, substitute functions

253

Substitute functions

If individual input signals should fail, the
ECU is without the important information it
needs for calculations. In such cases, substi-
tute functions are used. Two examples are
given below:

Example 1: The fuel temperature is needed
for calculation of the injected fuel quantity. If
the fuel-temperature sensor fails, the ECU
uses a substitute value for its calculations.
This must be selected so that excessive soot
formation is avoided, although this can lead
to a reduction of engine power in certain op-
erating ranges.

Example 2: Should the camshaft sensor fail,
the ECU applies the crankshaft-sensor signal
as a subsitute. Depending on the vehicle man-
ufacturer, there are a variety of different con-
cepts for using the crankshaft signal to deter-
mine when cylinder 1 is in the compression
cycle. The use of substitute functions leads to
engine restart taking slightly longer.

Substitute functions differ according to
 vehicle manufacturer, so that many vehicle-
specific functions are possible.

The diagnosis function stores data on all mal-
functions that occur. This data can then be
accessed in the workshop (refer also to the
Chapter “Electronic Diagnosis (OBD)”).

Boost-pressure control
Boost-pressure control applied to the ex-
haust-gas turbocharger improves the engine’s
torque curve in full-load operation, and its
exhaust and refill cycle in the part-load range.
The optimum (desired) boost pressure is a
function of engine speed, injected fuel quan-
tity, coolant and fuel temperature, and the
surrounding air pressure. This optimum (de-
sired) boost pressure is compared with the
actual value registered by the boost-pressure
sensor and, in the case of deviation, the ECU
either operates the bypass valve’s electropneu-
matic transducer or the guide blades of the
VTG (Variable Turbine Geometry) exhaust-
gas turbocharger (refer also to the Chapter
“Actuators”).

Fan triggering
When a given engine temperature is ex-
ceeded, the engine ECU triggers the engine
cooling fan, which continues to rotate for a
brief period after the engine is switched off.
This run-on period is a function of the
coolant temperature and the load imposed on
the engine during the preceding driving cycle.

Exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR)
In order to decrease the NOX emissions, ex-
haust gas is directed into the engine’s intake
duct through a channel, the cross section of
which can be varied by an EGR valve. The
EGR valve is triggered by an electropneu-
matic transducer or by an electric actuator.

Due to the high temperature of the exhaust
gas and its high proportion of contamination,
it is difficult to precisely measure the exhaust-
gas flow which is recirculated back into the en-
gine. Control, therefore, takes place indirectly
through an air-mass meter located in the flow
of fresh intake air. The meter’s output signal is
then compared in the ECU with the engine’s
theoretical air requirement which has been 
calculated from a variety of data (e.g. engine
rpm). The lower the measured mass of the in-
coming fresh air compared to the theoretical
air requirement, the higher is the proportion
of recirculated exhaust gas.

Data exchange with other systems

Data exchange with other
systems

Fuel-consumption signal 
The engine ECU (Fig. 1, 3) determines fuel
consumption and sends this signal via CAN
to the instrument cluster or a separate on-
board computer (6), where the driver is in-
formed of current fuel consumption and/or
the range that can be covered with the re-
maining fuel in the tank. Older systems 
used Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) for
the fuel-consumption signal.

Starter control
The starter motor (8) can be triggered from
the engine ECU. This ensures that the driver
cannot operate the starter motor with the en-
gine already running. The starter motor only
turns long enough to allow the engine to
reach a self-sustaining speed reliably. 
This function leads to a lighter, and thus
lower-priced, starter motor.

Glow control unit
The glow control unit (GZS, 5) receives infor-
mation from the engine ECU to control glow
start and duration. It then triggers the glow
plugs accordingly and monitors the glow
process, and reports back to the engine ECU
on any faults (diagnostic function). The pre-
glow indicator lamp is usually  triggered from
the engine ECU.

Electronic immobilizer
To prevent unauthorized starting and drive-
off, the engine cannot be started before a spe-
cial immobilizer (7) ECU removes the block
from the engine ECU. 

The driver can signal the immobilizer ECU

that he/she is authorized to use the  vehicle,
either by remote control or by means of the
glow-plug and starter switch (“Ignition” key).
The immobilizer ECU then removes the
block on the engine ECU to  allow engine start
and normal operation.

Data exchange with other systems, serial data transmission (CAN)

255

External torque intervention
In the case of external torque intervention,
the injected fuel quantity is influenced by an-
other (external) ECU (for instance, for trans-
mission-shift control, or TCS). This informs
the engine ECU whether the engine torque is
to be changed, and if so, by how much (this
defines the injected fuel quantity).

Alternator control
By means of a standard serial interface, the
EDC can control and monitor the alternator
(9) remotely. The regulator voltage can be
controlled, just the same as the complete
 alternator assembly can be switched off. In
case of low battery power, for instance, the al-
ternator’s charging curve can be improved by
increasing the idle speed. It is also possible to
perform simple alternator diagnosis through
this interface.

Air conditioner
In order to maintain comfortable tempera-
tures inside the vehicle when the ambient
temperature is high, the air conditioner (A/C)
cools down cabin air with the help of an A/C
compressor (10). Depending on the engine
and operating conditions, the A/C compres-
sor may draw as much as 30% of the engine’s
output power.

Immediately the driver hits the accelerator
pedal (in other words he/she wishes maxi-
mum torque), the compressor can be
switched off briefly by the engine ECU to
concentrate all of the engine’s power to the
wheels. Since the compressor is only switched
off very briefly, this has no noticeable effect
on interior temperature.

Serial data transmission
(CAN)

Modern-day vehicles are equipped with a
constantly increasing number of electronic
systems. Along with their need for extensive
exchange of data and information in order 
to operate efficiently, the data volumes and
speeds are also increasing at a rapid rate.

Although CAN (Controller Area Network) 
is a linear bus system (Fig. 1) specifically
 designed for automotive applications, it has
already been introduced in other sectors 
(for instance, in building automation).

Data is relayed in serial form, that is, one
after another on a common bus line. All CAN
stations have access to this bus, and via a
CAN interface in the ECUs, they can receive
and transmit data over the CAN bus line.
Since a considerable amount of data can be
exchanged and repeatedly accessed on a single
bus line, this network results in far fewer lines
required. On conventional systems, data ex-
change takes place point to point over indi-
vidually assigned data lines.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Serial data transmission (CAN)

Applications in the vehicle
For CAN in the vehicle there are four areas 
of application each of which has different re-
quirements. These are as follows:

Multiplex applications
Multiplex is suitable for use with applications
controlling the open and closed-loop control
of components in the sectors of body elec-
tronics, and comfort and convenience. These
include climate control, central locking, and
seat adjustment. Transfer rates are typically
between 10 kbaud and 125 kbaud (1 kbaud =
1 kbit/s) (low-speed CAN).

Mobile communications applications
In the area of mobile communications, CAN
networks such components as navigation sys-
tem, telephone, and audio installations with
the vehicle’s central display and operating
units. Networking here is aimed at standard-
izing operational sequences as far as possible,
and at concentrating status information at
one point so that driver distraction is reduced
to a minimum. With this  application, large
quantities of data are transmitted and data
transfer rates are in the 125 kbaud range. It is
impossible to directly transmit audio or video
data here.

Diagnosis applications
The diagnosis applications using CAN are
aimed at applying the already existing net-
work for the diagnosis of the connected
ECUs. The presently common form of diag-
nosis using the special K line (ISO 9141) then
becomes invalid. Large quantities of data are
also transferred in diagnostic applications,
and data transfer rates of 250 kbaud and
500 kbaud are planned.

Real-time applications 
Real-time applications serve for the open-
and closed-loop control of the vehicle’s
movements. Here, such electronic systems 
as engine management, transmission-shift
control and Electronic Stability Program
(ESP) are networked with each other via 
the CAN bus. Commonly, data transfer rates
of between 125 kbaud and 1 Mbaud (high-
speed CAN) are needed to guarantee the
 required real-time response.

Bus configuration
Configuration is understood to be the layout
and interaction between the components in a
given system. The CAN bus has a linear bus
topology, which in comparison with other
logical structures (ring bus and/or star bus)
features a lower failure probability. If one of
the stations fails, the bus still remains fully ac-
cessible to all the other stations. The stations
connected to the bus can be either ECUs, dis-
play devices, sensors, or actuators. They oper-
ate using the Multi-Master principle, whereby
the stations concerned all have equal priority
regarding their access to the bus. It is not nec-
essary to have a higher- order administration.

Content-based addressing
The CAN bus system does not address each
station individually according to its features,
but rather according to its message contents.
It allocates each “message” a fixed “identifier”
(message name) which identifies the contents
of the message in question (e.g., engine
speed). This identifier has a length of 11 bits
(standard format) or 29 bits (extended for-
mat).

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Serial data transmission (CAN)

257

With content-based addressing each station
must itself decide whether it is interested in
the message or not (“message filtering”
Fig. 2). This function can be performed by 
a special CAN module (Full-CAN), so that
less load is placed on the ECU’s central mi-
crocontroller. Basic CAN modules “read” all
messages. Using content-based addressing,
instead of allocating station addresses, makes
the complete system highly flexible so that
equipment variants are easier to install and
operate. If one of the ECUs requires new in-
formation which is already on the bus, all it
needs to do is call it up from the bus. Simi-
larly, provided they are receivers, new stations
can be connected (implemented) without it
being necessary to  modify the already existing
stations.

Bus arbitration
The identifier not only indicates the data con-
tent, but also defines the message’s priority
rating. An identifier corresponding to a low
binary number has high priority and vice
versa. Message priorities are a function for in-
stance of the speed at which their contents
change, or their significance with respect to
safety. There are never two (or more) mes-
sages of identical priority in the bus.

Each station can begin message transmis-

sion as soon as the bus is unoccupied.
 Conflict regarding bus access is avoided by
applying bit-by-bit identifier arbitration
(Fig. 3), whereby the message with the highest
priority is granted first access without delay
and without loss of data bits (nondestructive
protocol).

The CAN protocol is based on the logical
states “dominant” (logical 0) and “recessive”
(logical 1). The “Wired And” arbitration prin-
ciple permits the dominant bits transmitted by
a given station to overwrite the recessive bits of
the other stations. The station with the lowest
identifier (that is, with the highest priority) is
granted first access to the bus. 
The transmitters with low-priority messages
automatically become receivers, and repeat
their transmission attempt as soon as the bus
is vacant again.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Serial data transmission (CAN)

In order that all messages have a chance of
entering the bus, the bus speed must be ap-
propriate to the number of stations partici-
pating in the bus. A cycle time is defined for
those signals which fluctuate permanently
(e.g. engine speed).

Message format
CAN permits two different formats which
only differ with respect to the length of their
identifiers. The standard-format identifier is
11 bits long, and the extended-format identi-
fier 29 bits. Both formats are compatible with
each other and can be used together in a net-
work. The data frame comprises seven con-
secutive fields (Fig. 4) and is a maximum of
130 bits long (standard format) or 150 bits
(extended format).

The bus is recessive at idle. With its dominant
bit, the “Start of frame” indicates the begin-
ning of a message and synchronizes all sta-
tions.

The “Arbitration Field” consists of the mes-
sage’s identifier (as described above) and 
an additional control bit. While this field is
being transmitted, the transmitter accompa-
nies the transmission of each bit with a check
to ensure that it is still authorized to transmit
or whether another station with a higher-
priority message has accessed the Bus. The
control bit following the identifier is desig-
nated the RTR-bit (Remote Transmission 
Request). It defines whether the message is 
a “Data frame” (message with data) for a re-
ceiver station, or a “Remote frame” (request
for data) from a transmitter station. 

The “Data Field” contains the actual message
information comprised of between 0 and
8 bytes. A message with data length = 0 is
used to synchronize distributed processes. 
A number of signals can be transmitted in 
a single message (e.g., engine temperature
and engine speed).

The “CRC Field” (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
contains the frame check word for detecting
possible transmission interference.

The “ACK Field” contains the acknowledge-
ment signals used by the receiver stations to
confirm receipt of the message in non-cor-
rupted form. This field comprises the ACK
slot and the recessive ACK delimiter. The
ACK slot is also transmitted recessively and
overwritten “dominantly” by the receivers
upon the message being correctly received.
Here, it is irrelevant whether the message is 
of significance or not for the particular re-
ceiver in the sense of the message filtering or
acceptance check. Only correct reception is
confirmed.

The “End of Frame” marks the end of the
message and comprises 7 recessive bits.

The “Control Field” contains the IDE bit
(Identifier Extension Bit) used to differentiate
between standard format (IDE = 0) and ex-
tended format (IDE = 1), followed by a bit re-
served for future extensions. The remaining 
4 bits in this field define the number of data
bytes in the next data field. This enables the
receiver to determine whether all data has
been received.

If one of the stations detects an error, it inter-
rupts the actual transmission by sending an
“Error frame” comprising six successive dom-
inant bits. Its effect is based on the intended
violation of the stuffing rule, and the object is
to prevent other stations accepting the faulty
message.

Defective stations could have a derogatory ef-
fect upon the bus system by sending an “error
frame” and interrupting faultless messages. To
prevent this, CAN is provided with a function
which differentiates between sporadic errors
and those which are permanent, and which is
capable of identifying the faulty station. This
takes place using statistical evaluation of the
error situations.

Standardization
The International Organization for Standard-
ization (ISO) and SAE (Society of
 Automotive Engineers) have issued CAN
standards for data exchange in automotive
applications:
(cid:0) For low-speed applications up to 125 kbit/s:

ISO 11 519-2, and

(cid:0) For high-speed applications above

> 125 kBit/s: ISO 11 898 and SAE J 22 584
(passenger cars) and SAE J 1939 (trucks and
buses).

(cid:0) Furthermore, an ISO Standard on CAN 
Diagnosis (ISO 15 765 – Draft) is being 
prepared. 

The “Inter-Frame Space” comprises three bits
which serve to separate successive messages.
This means that the bus remains in the reces-
sive IDLE mode until a station starts a bus 
access.

As a rule, a sending station initiates data
transmission by sending a “data frame”. It is
also possible for a receiving station to call in
data from a sending station by transmitting a
“remote frame”.

Detecting errors
A number of control mechanisms for detect-
ing errors are integrated in the CAN  protocol. 

In the “CRC Field”, the receiving station com-
pares the received CRC sequence with the 
sequence calculated from the message.

With the “Frame Check”, frame errors are rec-
ognized by checking the frame structure. 

The CAN protocol contains a number of
fixed-format bit fields which are checked by
all stations.

The “ACK Check” is the receiving stations’
confirmation that a message frame has been
received. Its absence signifies for instance that
a transmission error has been detected.

“Monitoring” indicates that the sender ob-
serves (monitors) the bus level and compares
the differences between the bit that has been
sent and the bit that has been checked.

Compliance with “Bitstuffing” is checked by
means of the “Code check”. The stuffing con-
vention stipulates that in every “Data Frame”
or “Remote Frame” a maximum of five succes-
sive equal-priority bits may be sent between
the “Start of Frame” and the end of the “CRC
Field”. As soon as five identical bits have been
transmitted in succession, the sender inserts an
opposite-priority bit. The receiving station
erases these opposite-priority bits after receiv-
ing the message. Line errors can be detected 
using the “bitstuffing” principle.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Application-related adaptation of car engines

1) Some parts of the

adaptation process 
are also referred to 
as  calibration.

Application-related
 adaptation 1) of car engines

Application-related adaptation means modi-
fication of an engine to suit a particular type
of vehicle intended for a specific type of use.
Adaptation of the fuel-injection system –
and specifically of electronic diesel control
EDC – is a major part of that process.

All new diesel engines for cars are now di-
rect-injection (DI) engines. And they all
have to comply with the Euro III emission
control standards that have been in force
since 2000, or other comparable standards.
These emission standards – combined with
the higher expectations in the area of vehicle
user-friendliness – can only be met by the
use of sophisticated electronic control sys-
tems. Such systems have the capability – 
and reflect the necessity – of controlling
thousands of parameters (approx. 6,000 in
the case of the present EDC generation).
Those parameters are subdivided into:
(cid:2) Individual parameter values 

(e.g. temperature thresholds at which
 specific functions are activated) and 
(cid:2) Ranges of parameter values in the form 

of two-dimensional or multi-dimensional

data maps (e.g. injection point tE as a
function of engine speed n, injected-fuel
quantity me and start of delivery FB)

The optimization potential of EDC systems
has become so great that it is now limited
only by the constraints of time available and
the cost of the personnel and the work in-
volved in adapting and testing the various
functions and their interaction.

Adaptation phases
Application-related adaptation of car en-
gines is subdivided into the three stages
 described below.

Hardware adaptation
In the context of application-related adapta-
tion of car engines, items such as the com-
bustion chamber, the injection pump and
the injectors are referred to as hardware.
That hardware is primarily adapted in such
a way that the performance and emission
figures demanded are obtained. Hardware
adaptation is performed initially on an en-
gine test bench under static conditions. If
dynamic tests are possible on the test bench,
they are used to further optimize the engine
and the fuel-injection system.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Application-related adaptation of car engines

261

Software adaptation
Once the hardware adaptation is complete,
the control-unit software is accordingly
 configured and adapted for optimum mixture
preparation and combustion control. 
For example, this includes calculating and
programming the engine data maps for start
of injection, exhaust-gas recirculation and
charge-air pressure. As with hardware adapta-
tion, this work is carried out on the test
bench.

Vehicle-related adaptation
When the basis for the initial vehicle trials has
been established, adaptation of all parameters
that affect engine response and dynamic
characteristics takes place. This third stage in-
volves the essential adaptation to the particu-
lar vehicle concerned. The work is for the
greater part performed with the engine in situ
(Fig. 1).

Interaction between the three phases
As there are reciprocal effects between the
adaptation phases, recursions (repeated pro-
cedures) are required. As soon as possible, it
is also necessary to run all three phases simul-
taneously with the engine in the vehicle and
on the test bench.

2

Stages in the calibration of a control function

For example, at low engine loads a very high
exhaust-gas recirculation rate is aimed at in
order to reduce the NOX emissions. Under
 dynamic conditions, this can lead to poor “ac-
celerator response” on the part of the  engine.
In order to obtain good acceleration charac-
teristics, the static emissions settings pro-
grammed in the software adaptation phase
must be re-adjusted. In turn, this may result
in negative effects on emissions under certain
engine operating conditions which have to be
compensated for under other conditions.

In the example outlined, there is a fundamen-
tal conflict between the various objectives: on
the one hand, strict requirements have to be
met (e.g. statutory limits for exhaust emission
levels), while on the other hand there are “op-
tional” demands that are more attributable to
the desire for comfort and performance (en-
gine response, noise, etc.). The latter can re-
sult in opposing conclusions. A compromise
between the different objectives offers the ve-
hicle manufacturer the opportunity to imbue
the vehicle with some of the features that
make up its characteristic brand identity.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Application-related adaptation of car engines

Adaptation to differing 
ambient  conditions
The various controllers and adjustment para-
meters must be configured for a wide variety
of different ambient conditions. To control
idle speed, for example, there are several pa-
rameter sets for each individual gear which
are further differentiated according to
whether
(cid:2) The vehicle is stationary or moving
(cid:2) The engine is warm or cold
(cid:2) The clutch is engaged or disengaged

That means that for this function alone, there
are as many as 50 parameter sets.

The EDC also provides adaptation functions
for extreme ambient conditions. These gener-
ally have to be verified by specifically targeted
special trials involving
(cid:2) Cold-weather testing in temperatures down

to –25°C (e.g. winter trials in  Sweden)
(cid:2) Hot-weather testing in temperatures over

40°C (e.g. summer trials in Arizona)
(cid:2) High-altitude/low atmospheric pressure

testing (e.g. in the Alps) and 

(cid:2) Combined hot-weather and altitude or

cold-weather and altitude testing, e.g. tow-
ing a heavy trailer over mountain passes
(e.g. in Spain’s Sierra Nevada or in the
Alps)

For cold starting, very specific adjustments
have to be made to the injected fuel quantity
and the start of delivery based on engine
coolant temperature. In addition, the glow
plugs have to be switched on. At high alti-
tudes with a cold engine, the effectively avail-
able pull-away torque is very low. For some
applications, EDC suspends turbocharger
 operation for that short period because it
would otherwise “use up” a large proportion
of the engine’s torque output. Particularly in
the case of vehicles with automatic transmis-
sion, this would prevent the vehicle from
pulling away at all, as the torque available at
the driving wheels would be insufficient.

Altitude compensation for turbocharged
 engines demands limitation of the required
turbocharger pressure in response to atmos-
pheric pressure, as otherwise the turbocharger
would be destroyed by over-revving.

Other adjustments
Safety functions
As well as the functions that determine emis-
sion levels, power output and user-friendli-
ness, there are also numerous safety functions
that require adaptation (e.g. response to fail-
ure of a sensor or actuator).

Such safety functions are primarily in-
tended to restore the vehicle to a safe operat-
ing condition for the driver and/or to ensure
the safe operation of the engine (e.g. to pre-
vent engine damage).

Communication
There are also numerous functions which 
require communication between the engine
control unit and other control units on the
vehicle (e.g. traction control, ESP, transmis-
sion control for automatic transmission and
electronic immobilizer). For this reason, 
a special communication code is employed
(input and output variables). Where neces-
sary, additional measured data has to be
 calculated and encoded in the appropriate
form.

Since the arrival of the EDC system in 1986,
the possibilities for optimization, especially
with regard to the convenience features, have
considerably expanded. A wide variety of
software functions (e.g. control functions) 
are used, all of which have to be specifically
adapted to each individual vehicle. Some
 examples are outlined below.

Idle-speed control
This function controls the speed at which the
engine runs when the accelerator pedal is not
depressed. Idle-speed control must operate
with absolute reliability under all possible en-
gine operating conditions. Therefore, exten-
sive adaptation work is required. Adjustment
of the coasting response in all gears, for ex-
ample, is highly involved, especially with re-
gard to the interplay with the twin-mass fly-
wheels generally used. This type of flywheel
produces highly complex rotational vibration
effects throughout the drivetrain.

The first stage of the process is an analytical
definition (i.e. recording of the controlled
system response, description of the controlled
system by algorithms and definition of the
control parameters).

This is followed by a comprehensive road
test. A circular track (test track) provides the
possibility for virtually unlimited flat-road
driving. Particularly with active surge
 damping, conflict between objectives can
arise as this function may prevent rapid com-
pensation in response to abrupt changes in
engine speed or load.

Apart from the drivetrain, the engine

mountings also play an important part. In or-
der to diminish the various conflicts in objec-
tives, therefore, some applications employ
variable-characteristic engine mountings
which are controlled by the EDC. These can
be set to a softer setting when the engine is
idling and to a harder response when the en-
gine is under load.

Smooth-running control
The engine smooth-running function ensures
that the injection volumes are the same for all
cylinders and in so doing improves engine
smoothness and emission levels. Under certain
circumstances, a malfunction can  occur at very
high or very low ambient temperatures if the 
vibration damping characteristics of the belt
drive systems for auxiliary units (e.g. alternator,
power-steering pump, air-conditioning com-
pressor) significantly alter. Depending on the
frequencies generated as a result of periodic
speed fluctuations, the engine smooth-running
function may attempt to even them out by alter-
ation of the injected-fuel quantity volume for 
individual cylinders. Under unfavourable condi-
tions, this may then result in higher exhaust-
emission levels or make the engine run even
more unevenly. For that reason, this function
must be thoroughly tested under all operating
conditions.

Pressure-charging controller
Almost all existing DI car diesel engines are 
fitted with turbochargers. On most of those
engines, the charge-air pressure is controll ed
by the EDC system. The aim is to  obtain
 optimum response characteristics (rapid gen-
eration of charge-air pressure) while  ensuring
reliable protection of the engine against exces-
sive charge-air pressure and consequent exces-
sively high cylinder  pressure.

Exhaust-Gas Recirculation EGR
Exhaust-gas recirculation EGR is now a stan-
dard feature of DI car diesel engines. As previ-
ously indicated, together with the control 
of turbocharger pressure it is a determining
factor in the amount of air that enters the en-
gine. In order to ensure smokeless and low-
NOX combustion, the air-fuel mixture must
conform to precisely defined parameters for all
engine operating conditions. Those parameters
are initially optimized under static conditions
on the engine test bench. The control function
then has the task of maintaining those para-
meters under dynamic operating conditions
without adversely affecting the response char-
acteristics of the engine.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Application-related adaptation of commercial-vehicle engines

1) Some parts of the

adaptation process 
are also referred to 
as calibration.

Application-related
 adaptation 1) of  commercial-
vehicle engines
Particularly because of its economy and 
durability, the diesel has established itself 
as the engine of choice for commercial 
vehicles. Today all new engines are direct-
injection (DI) designs.

Optimization objectives
For commercial-vehicle engines, the follow-
ing attributes are optimized.

Comfort/convenience
The demands relating to such aspects as
 engine response, quietness, smoothness and
starting characteristics must also be taken
into account.

Adaptation phases
The aim of adaptation is to ensure that the
objectives outlined above are achieved as fully
as possible, i.e. that the best possible compro-
mise is reached between competing demands.
This involves adaptation of engine and fuel-
injection hardware components as well as

Torque
The aim is to obtain the maximum possible
torque under all operating conditions in or-
der to be able to move heavy loads in even the
most difficult situations (e.g. when negotiat-
ing steep gradients or using PTO  drives).
When pursuing that objective, the engine’s
limits (e.g. maximum permissible cylinder
pressure and exhaust temperature) as well as
the smoke emission limit have to be taken
into account.

Fuel consumption
For commercial vehicles, economy is a deci-
sive factor. For that reason fuel consumption
occupies a position of greater importance for
commercial vehicles than is the case with
cars. Minimizing fuel consumption (or CO2
emissions) is therefore of prime significance
in engine adaptation.

Durability
Modern commercial-vehicle engines are ex-
pected to be able to complete over a million
kilometers of service.

Pollutant emissions
Since October 2000, new commercial vehicles
registered in the European Union have been
required to conform to the Euro III emission-
control standard. Engine adaptation must 
ensure that the limits for NOX, particulate,
HC and CO emission and exhaust opacity are
reliably complied with.

management module.

As with car engines, the phases of hard-
ware, software and vehicle-related adaptation
can be distinguished (Fig. 1).

Hardware adaptation
Hardware adaptation involves making modifi-
cations to all significant “components” of the
engine and fuel-injection system. Significant
engine-hardware components include the
combustion chamber, the turbocharger, the
air-intake system (e.g. swirl-imparting com-

ponents) and, if necessary, the exhaust-recir-
culation system. Significant components of
the fuel-injection system are the injection
pump, the high-pressure fuel lines if applica-
ble, and the injectors. Hardware adaptation 
is carried out on the engine test bench.

Software adaptation
Once the hardware adaptation is complete,
the control-unit software is configured ac-
cordingly. Stored in the software are the rela-
tionships between a vast number of engine
and fuel-injection parameters (for examples,
see Fig. 2). This work too is carried out on the
engine test bench. An application control
unit, which – as with the adaptation of car
engines – is linked to a PC with operator soft-
ware, provides access to the software to be
adapted.

The following tasks are performed in the
course of software adaptation:
(cid:2) Calibration of the basic engine-data maps

under static operating conditions

(cid:2) Control function configuration
(cid:2) Calibration of compensation data maps
(cid:2) Optimisation of engine-data maps under

dynamic conditions

First of all, adjustments to the system-specific
parameters – such as start of injection, injec-
tion pressure, exhaust-gas recirculation,
charge-air pressure and, if applicable, pre-
and post-injection – are carried out under
static operating conditions on the engine test
bench. The test results are assessed with refer-
ence to the target criteria (emission levels,
fuel consumption, etc.). Based on those re-
sults, the appropriate parameter values, data
curves and data maps are then calculated and
programmed (Fig. 3 overleaf).  Because of the
ever increasing number of such parameters,
automation of parameter configuration is a
continuing aim.

Electronic Diesel Control (EDC)

Application-related adaptation of commercial-vehicle engines

the major parameters is factored into so-
called compensation data maps. In addition,
existing control functions are adapted (e.g.
fuel-rail pressure control for common-rail in-
jection systems, charge-air pressure control).
The data established under static operating
conditions is finally optimized  under dy-
namic conditions.

Examples of adaptation
Idle-speed control
When adapting the idle-speed control func-
tion for a commercial-vehicle engine, major
emphasis is generally placed on good load 
response and minimal undershoot. This en-
sures good pulling away and manoeuvring 
capabilities even when carrying heavy loads.

Vehicle-related adaptation
The process of vehicle-related adaptation
 involves modifying the basic design of the 
engine arrived at on the test bench to the
specifics of the vehicle in which it is to be
used, and testing conformity with require-
ments under as wide a range as possible of
real operating and ambient conditions.

The behavior of the drivetrain as a controlled
system depends heavily on temperature and
transmission ratio. For that reason the en-
gine-management module has multiple 
parameter sets for idle-speed control. When
defining those parameters, changes in the 
drivetrain response over its service life must
also be taken into account.

The adaptation/testing of the basic functions
such as idle-speed control, engine response
and starting characteristics is essentially per-
formed in the same way as for cars, though
the assessment criteria may differ according 
to the particular type of application. When
adapting an engine for use in a bus, for exam-
ple, more emphasis is placed on comfort as-
pects or low noise output, whereas a truck 
engine for long-distance operation would be
designed more for reliable and economical
transportation of heavy loads.

Data maps for start of injection and smoke limitation

Power take-off (PTO) drives
Many commercial vehicles have PTO drives
that are used to drive cranes, lifting plat-
forms, pumps, etc. These often require the
diesel engine to run at a virtually constant,
higher operating speed that is unaffected by
load. This can be governed by the EDC sys-
tem using the “intermediate-speed control”
function. Once again, the control function
parameters can be adapted to the require-
ments of the driven machine.

Engine response characteristics
In the process of adaptation, engine response
characteristics, i.e. the way in which accelera-
tor-pedal position is translated into injected-
fuel quantity and engine torque output, are 
to a large extent infinitely variable through
control-unit configuration. 
It ultimately depends on the application 
as to whether an “RQ characteristic 6)” or
“RQV characteristic 7)” engine response is
programmed, or a mixture of the two.

Communication
The EDC control unit on a commercial vehi-
cle is normally part of a network of multiple
electronic control units. The exchange of data
between vehicle, transmission, brake and en-
gine control units takes place via an electronic
data bus (usually a CAN). Correct interaction
between the various control units involved
cannot be fully tested and optimized until
they are installed in the vehicle, as the process
of basic configuration on the engine test
bench usually involves only the engine-
management module on its own.

A typical example of the interaction between
two vehicle control units is the process of
changing gear with an automatic transmis-
sion. The transmission control unit sends 
a request via the data bus for a reduction in
injection quantity at the optimum point in
the gear-shifting operation. The engine con-
trol unit then makes the requested reduction
– without input from the driver – thus en-
abling the transmission control unit to disen-
gage the current gear. If necessary, the trans-
mission control unit may request an  increase
in engine speed at the appropriate point to 
facilitate engagement of the new gear. Once
the operation is complete, control over the 
injected fuel quantity is passed back to the
driver.

Electromagnetic compatibility
The large number of electronic vehicle systems
and the wide use of other electronic communi-
cations equipment (e.g. radio telephones, two-
way radios, GPS navigation systems) in com-
mercial vehicles make it necessary to optimize
the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of
the engine-management module and all its
connecting leads in terms both of immunity to
external interference and of emission of inter-
ference signals. Of course, a large proportion of
this optimization work is carried out during
the development of the control units and sen-
sors concerned. Since, however, the dimension-
ing (e.g. length of  cable runs, type of shielding)
and routing of the wiring looms in the actual
vehicle has a major influence on immunity to
and creation of interference, testing and, if nec-
essary, optimization of the complete vehicle in-
side an EMC room is absolutely essential.

Fault diagnosis
The diagnostic capabilities demanded of
commercial-vehicle systems are also very ex-
tensive. Reliable diagnosis of faults ensures
maximum possible vehicle availability.

The engine control unit constantly checks that
the signals from all connected sensors and 
actuators are within the specified limits and
also tests for loose contacts, short circuits to
ground or to battery voltage, and for plausibil-
ity with other signals. The signal range limits
and plausibility criteria must be defined by
the application developer. As with car engines,
those limits must on the one hand be suffi-
ciently broad to ensure that extreme condi-
tions (e.g. hot or cold weather, high altitudes)
do not produce false diagnoses, and on the
other, sufficiently narrow to provide adequate
sensitivity to real faults. In addition, fault re-
sponse procedures must be defined which
specify whether and in what way the engine
may continue to be operated if a specific fault
is detected. Finally, detected faults have to be
stored in a fault memory in order that service
technicians can quickly locate and remedy the
problem.

Engine test bench

A fuel-injection system is tested on an engine
test bench as part of its development process.
Engine test benches are designed to allow
easy access to the various parts of the engine.

tion software, the statutory emission control
tests can then be run on the test bench rather
than on a vehicle tester with the engine in situ.

The test-bench computer (20) is responsible
for controlling and monitoring the engine and
the testing equipment. It also takes care of
data recording and storage. With the aid of
automation software, calibration operations
(e.g. data-map measurements) can be carried
out very efficiently.

Using a suitable quick-change system (8), the
pallets with the engines to be tested can be
changed over within about twenty minutes.
This increases test-bench capacity utilization.

By conditioning the supply fluids such as in-
take air, fuel and engine coolant, (i.e. control-
ling their temperature and/or pressure) repro-
ducible results can be obtained.

In addition to measurements under static op-
erating conditions, dynamic tests with rapid
load and engine-speed changes are increas-
ingly demanded. For such purposes there are
test benches with electric dynamometers (18).
They can not only retard but also drive the test
vehicle (e.g. in order to simulate overrun when
traveling downhill). Using appropriate simula-

is the INCA (Integrated Calibration and
 Acquisition System) program, compromising
a number of different tools. It is made up of
the following components:
(cid:2) The Core System incorporates all measure-

ment and adjustment functions.

(cid:2) The Offline Tools (standard specification)

comprise the software for analysis of mea-
sured data and management of adjustment
data, and the programming tool for the
Flash EPROM.

The use and function of the calibration tools
can be illustrated by the description below of
a typical calibration process.

Calibration tools

The traditional calibration tools (for car and
commercial-vehicle applications) include

cylinder engine which has small windows
and mirrors that allow the  combustion
process to be observed)

(cid:2) The engine test bench
(cid:2) The EMC room and

microphones for measuring sound levels or
strain gauges for measuring mechanical
stress

Computer simulation of hardware and soft-
ware components is also becoming increas-
ingly important. A large part of the adapta-
tion work, however, is carried out using PC-
based calibration tools. Such programs allow

Calibration tools

Software calibration process
Defining the desired characteristics
The desired characteristics (e.g. dynamic re-
sponse, noise output, exhaust composition)
are defined by the engine manufacturer and
the (exhaust emissions) legislation. The aim
of calibration is to alter the characteristics 
of the engine so that those requirements are
met. This necessitates testing on the engine
test bench and in the vehicle.

Preparations
Special electronic engine control units are
used for calibration. Compared with the con-
trol units used on the production models,
they allow the alteration of parameters that
are fixed for normal operation. An important
aspect of the preparations is choosing and
setting up the appropriate hardware and/or
software interface.

Additional measuring equipment (e.g. tem-
perature sensors, flow meters) enables the
recording of other physical variables for
 special tests.

Establishing and documenting the actual 
system responses
The recording of specific measured data is
carried out using the INCA core system. 
The information concerned can be displayed
on the screen and analyzed in the form of 
numerical values or graphs.

The measured data can not only be viewed 
after the measurements have been taken but
while measurement is still in progress. 
In that way, the response of the engine to
changes (e.g. in the exhaust-gas recirculation
rate) can be investigated. The data can also be
recorded for subsequent analysis of transient
processes (e.g. engine starting).

Identifying possibilities for manipulation
With the help of the control-unit software
documentation (data framework) it is possi-
ble to identify which parameters are best
suited to altering system behavior in the 
manner desired.

Alteration of selected parameters 
The parameters stored in the control-unit
software can be displayed as numerical values
(in tables) or as graphs (curves) on the PC
and altered. Each time an alteration is made,
the system response is observed.

All parameters can be altered while the  engine
is running so that the effects are  immediately
observable and measurable.

In the case of short-lived or transient

processes (e.g. engine starting) it is effectively
impossible to alter the parameters while the
process is in progress. In such cases, therefore,
the process has to be recorded during the
course of a test, the measured data saved in 
a file and then the parameters that are to be
altered identified by analyzing the recorded
data.

Further tests are performed in order to
evaluate the success of the adjustments made
or to learn more about the process.

Documentation is important because several
people will be involved in the process of en-
gine optimization at different times.

Documenting the modified parameters 
The changes to the parameters are also
 compared and documented. This is done 
with the offline tool ADM (Application 
Data Manager), sometimes also called CDM
(Calibration Data Manager).

The calibration data obtained by various
technicians is compared and merged into 
a single data record.

Programming additional control units 
The new parameter settings arrived at can
also be used on other engine control units for
further calibration. This necessitates repro-
gramming of the Flash EPROMs of those
control units. This is carried out  using the
INCA core system tool PROF (Programming
of Flash EPROM).

Depending on the extent of the calibration
and the design innovations, multiple looping
of the steps described above may take place.

Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

Operating conditions, design and construction, data processing

Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

Digital technology furnishes an extensive 
array of options for open and closed-loop
control of automotive electronic systems. 
A large number of parameters can be in-
cluded in the process to support optimal op-
eration of various systems. After receiving
the electric signals transmitted by the sen-
sors, the control unit processes these data in
order to generate control signals for the actu-
ators. The control program, the “software”, is
stored in a special memory and implemented
by a microcontroller. 
The control unit and its components are
 referred to as “hardware”. The EDC control
unit contains all of the algorithms for open
and closed-loop control needed to govern the
engine-management processes.

Operating conditions

The ECU is subjected to very high demands
with respect to
(cid:0) extreme ambient temperatures 
(during normal operation from 
–40°C to +60...+125°C),

(cid:0) violent temperature fluctuations,
(cid:0) resistance to the effects of such 
materials as oil and fuel, etc.,
(cid:0) surrounding dampness, and
(cid:0) mechanical stresses such as engine

 vibrations.

The ECU must continue to perform flawlessly
during starts with a weak battery (cold starts,
etc.) as well as at high charge voltages (surge
in onboard electrical system).

Other requirements arise from the need for
EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility). The
standards of electromagnetic interference 
immunity and the limitations on emission 
of high-frequency interference signals are 
extremely strict.

Design and construction

The pcb (printed-circuit board) with the elec-
tronic components (Fig. 1) is installed in a
metal case, and connected to the sensors, ac-
tuators, and power supply through a multi-
pole plug-in connector (4). The high-power
driver stages (6) for the direct triggering of
the actuators are integrated in the ECU case
in such a manner that excellent heat dissipa-
tion to the case is ensured.

When the ECU is mounted directly on the

engine, an integrated heat sink is used to 
dissipate the heat from the ECU case to the
fuel which permanently flushes the ECU. 
This ECU cooler is only used on commercial
vehicles. Compact, engine-mounted hybrid-
technology ECUs are available for even higher
levels of temperature loading.

The majority of the electronic components

use SMD technology (Surface-Mounted 
Device). so that a particularly space-saving
and weight-saving design can be used. Con-
ventional wiring is only applied at some of
the power-electronics components and at 
the plug-in connections.

Data processing

Input signals
In their role as peripheral components, the
actuators and the sensors represent the inter-
face between the vehicle and the ECU in its
role as the processing unit. The electrical 
signals from the sensors travel through the
wiring harness and the plug to reach the 
control unit. These signals can be of the
 following type:

Analog input signals
Within a given range, analog input signals 
can assume practically any voltage value.
 Examples of physical quantities which are
available as analog measured values are in-
take-air mass, battery voltage, intake-mani-
fold and boost pressure, coolant and intake-
air temperature. An Analog/Digital Converter
(ADC) within the ECU’s microcontroller

transforms the signal data in the digital form
required by the microcontroller’s central pro-
cessing unit. The maximum resolution of
these analog signals is 5 mV. This translates
into roughly 1,000 incremental graduations
based on an overall monitoring range of
0...5 V.

Digital input signals
Digital input signals only have two states.
They are either “high” or “low” (logical 1 and
logical 0 respectively). Examples of digital in-
put signals are on/off switching signals, or
digital sensor signals such as the rotational-
speed pulses from a Hall generator or a 
magnetoresistive sensor. Such signals are
processed directly by the microcontroller.

Pulse-shaped input signals
The pulse-shaped signals from inductive sen-
sors containing information on rotational
speed and reference mark are conditioned in
their own ECU stage. Here, spurious pulses
are suppressed and the pulse-shaped signals
converted into digital rect angular signals.

Signal conditioning
Protective circuitry is used to limit the input
signals to a permissible maximum voltage. By
applying filtering techniques, the superim-
posed interference signals are to a great extent
removed from the useful signal which, if nec-
essary, is then amplified to the permissible 
input-signal level for the  microcontroller
(0...5 V).

Signal conditioning can take place com-
pletely or partially in the sensor depending
upon the sensor’s level of integration. 

Signal processing
The control unit is the switching center gov-
erning all of the functions and sequences reg-
ulated by the engine-management system.
The closed and open-loop control functions
are executed in the microcontroller. The in-
put signals from sensors and interfaces link-
ing other systems (e.g., CAN bus) serve as the
input parameters and are subjected to a fur-
ther plausibility check in the computer. The
ECU program supports generation of the
output signals used to control the actuators.

Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

Data processing

Microcontroller
The microcontroller is the ECU’s central
component (Fig. 2) and controls its operative
sequence. Apart from the CPU (Central Pro-
cessing Unit), the microcontroller contains
not only the input and output channels, but
also timer units, RAMs, ROMs, serial inter-
faces, and further peripheral assemblies, all of
which are integrated on a single microchip.
Quartz-controlled timing is used for the mi-
crocontroller.

Program and data memory
In order to carry out the computations, the
microcontroller needs a program – the “soft-
ware”. This is in the form of binary numerical
values arranged in data records and stored in
a program memory. These binary values are
accessed by the CPU which interprets them as
commands which it implements one after the
other (refer also to the Chapter “Electronic
open and closed-loop control”).

This program is stored in a Read-Only 
Memory (ROM, EPROM, or Flash-EPROM)
which also contains variant-specific data 
(individual data, characteristic curves, and
maps). This is non-variable data which can-
not be changed during vehicle operation. 
It is used to regulate the program’s open 
and closed-loop control processes.

The program memory can be integrated 
in the microcontroller and, depending upon
the particular application, expanded by the
addition of a separate component (e.g., by 
an external EPROM or a Flash-EPROM).

ROM
Program memories can be in the form of 
a ROM (Read Only Memory). This is a 
memory whose contents have been defined
permanently during manufacture and there-
after remain unalterable. The ROM installed
in the microcontroller only has a restricted
memory capacity, which means that an addi-
tional ROM is required in case of compli-
cated applications.

Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

Data processing

275

EPROM
The data on an EPROM (Erasable Program-
mable ROM) can be erased by subjecting the
device to UV light. Fresh data can then be 
entered using a programming unit. 

The EPROM is usually in the form of a
separate component, and is accessed by the
CPU through the Address/Data-Bus.

Flash-EPROM (FEPROM)
The Flash-EPROM is electrically erasable so
that it becomes possible to reprogram the
ECU in the service workshops without having
to open it. In the process, the ECU is con-
nected to the reprogramming unit through a
serial interface.

If the microcontroller is also equipped with

a ROM, this contains the programming rou-
tines for the Flash programming. Flash-
EPROMs are available which, together with
the microcontroller, are integrated on a single
microchip (as from EDC16).

Its decisive advantages have helped the
Flash-EPROM to largely supersede the con-
ventional EPROM.

Variable-data or main memory
Such a read/write memory is needed in order
to store variable data (variables), such as, for
example, arithmetic values and signal values.

RAM
Instantaneous values are stored in the RAM
(Random Access Memory) read/write mem-
ory. If complex applications are involved, the
memory capacity of the RAM incorporated
in the microcontroller is insufficient so that
an additional RAM module becomes neces-
sary. It is connected to the ECU through the
Address/Data-Bus. 

When the ECU is switched off by turning
the “ignition” key, the RAM loses its complete
stock of data (volatile memory).

EEPROM (also known as the E2PROM)
As stated above, the RAM loses its informa-
tion immediately its power supply is removed
(e.g. when the “ignition switch” is turned to
OFF). Data which must be retained, for in-
stance the codes for the vehicle immobilizer
and the fault-store data, must therefore be
stored in a non-erasable (non-volatile) mem-
ory. The EEPROM is an electrically erasable
EPROM in which (in contrast to the Flash-
EPROM) every single memory location can
be erased individually. It has been designed
for a large number of writing cycles, which
means that the  EEPROM can be used as a
non-volatile read/write memory.

ASIC
The ever-increasing complexity of ECU func-
tions means that the computing powers of
the standard microcontrollers available on
the market no longer suffice. The solution
here is to use so-called ASIC modules (Appli-
cation Specific Integrated Circuit). These ICs
(Integrated Circuits) are designed and pro-
duced in accordance with data from the ECU
development departments and, as well as be-
ing equipped with an extra RAM and inputs
and outputs, for instance, they can also gener-
ate and transmit PWM signals (see “PWM
signals” below).

Monitoring module
The ECU is provided with a monitoring
module. Using a “Question and Answer” cy-
cle, the microcontroller and the monitoring
module supervise each other, and as soon as a
fault is detected one of them triggers appro-
priate back-up functions independent of the
other.

276

Electronic Control Unit (ECU)

Data processing

Output signals
With its output signals, the microcontroller
triggers driver stages which are usually pow-
erful enough to operate the actuators directly.
It is also possible for specific driver stage to
trigger relays for particularly large power con-
sumers (e.g., engine fans). 

The driver stages are proof against shorts
to ground or battery voltage, as well as against
destruction due to electrical or thermal over-
load. Such malfunctions, together with open-
circuit lines or sensor faults are identified by
the driver-stage IC as an error and reported
to the microcontroller.

Switching signals
These are used to switch the actuators on and
off (for instance, for the engine fan).

PWM signals
Digital output signals can be in the form 
of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) signals.
These are constant-frequency rectangular sig-
nals with variable on-times (Fig. 3), which
can be used to move various actuators into
any operating positions (e.g., exhaust-gas 
recirculation valve, fan, heater elements,
charge-pressure actuator).

Communication within the ECU
In order to be able to support the microcon-
troller in its work, the peripheral components
must communicate with it. This takes place
using an address/data bus which, for instance,
the microcomputer uses to issue the RAM ad-
dress whose contents are to be accessed. The
data bus is then used to transmit the relevant
data. For former automotive applications, an
8-bit structure sufficed. 
This meant that the data bus comprised
8 lines which together could transmit 256 val-
ues simultaneously. The 16-bit address bus
commonly used with such systems can ac-
cess 65,536 addresses. Presently, more com-
plex systems demand 16 bits, or even 32 bits,
for the data bus. In order to save on pins at
the components, the data and address buses
can be combined in a multiplex system, i.e.,
addresses and data are dispatched through
the same lines but offset from each other with
respect to time.

Serial interfaces with only a single data line
are used for data which need not be transmit-
ted so quickly (e.g. data from the fault stor-
age).

EoL programming
The extensive variety of vehicle variants with
differing control programs and data records,
makes it imperative to have a system which
reduces the number of ECU types needed by
a given manufacturer. To this end, the Flash
EPROM’s complete memory area can be pro-
grammed at the end of vehicle production
with the program and the variant-specific
data record (EoL, End-of-Line program-
ming). A further possibility is to have a num-
ber of data variants available (e.g., gearbox
variants), which can then be selected by spe-
cial coding at the end of the line (EoL). This
coding is stored in an EEPROM.

Very severe demands are made on the ECU

277

(cid:0)

Very severe demands are made on the ECU

Basically, the ECU in the vehicle functions
the same as a conventional PC. Data is en-
tered from which output signals are calcu-
lated. The heart of the ECU is the printed-cir-
cuit board (pcb) with microcontroller using
high-precision microelectronic techniques.
The automotive ECU though must fulfill a
number of other requirements.

Real-time compatibility

Systems for the engine and for road/traffic
safety demand very rapid response of the
control, and the ECU must therefore be
“real-time compatible”. This means that the
control's reaction must keep pace with the
actual physical process being controlled.
lt must be certain that a real-time system
 responds within a fixed period of time to the
demands made upon it. This necessitates
appropriate computer architecture and very
high computer power.

Integrated design and construction

The equipment’s weight and the installation
space it requires inside the vehicle are be-
coming increasingly decisive. The following
technologies, and others, are used to make
the ECU as small and light as possible:
(cid:1) Multilayer: The printed-circuit conductors
are between 0.035 and 0.07 mm thick 
and are “stacked” on top of each other 
in layers.

(cid:1) SMD components are very small and flat
and have no wire connections through
holes in the pcb. They are soldered or
glued to the pcb or hybrid substrate,
hence SMD (Surface Mounted Devices).

(cid:1) ASIC: Specifically designed integrated
component (Application-Specific Inte-
grated Circuit) which can combine a 
large number of different functions.

Operational reliability

Very high levels of resistance to failure are
provided by integrated diagnosis and redun-

dant mathematical processes (additional
processes, usually running in parallel on
other program paths).

Environmental influences

Notwithstanding the wide range of environ-
mental influences to which it is subjected,
the ECU must always operate reliably.
(cid:1) Temperature: Depending upon the area
of application, the ECUs installed in vehi-
cles must perform faultlessly during con-
tinual operation at temperatures between
–40°C and + 60...125°C. In fact, due to
the heat radiated from the components,
the temperature at some areas of the sub-
strate is considerably higher. The tempera-
ture change involved in starting at cold
temperatures and then running up to hot
operating temperatures is particularly
 severe.

(cid:1) EMC: The vehicle’s electronics have to go
through severe electromagnetic compati-
bility testing. That is, the ECU must re-
main completely unaffected by electro-
magnetic disturbances emanating from
such sources as the ignition, or radiated
by radio transmitters and mobile tele-
phones. Conversely, the ECU itself must
not negatively affect other electronic
equipment.

(cid:1) Resistance to vibration: ECUs which are
mounted on the engine must be able to
withstand vibrations of up to 30 g (that is,
30 times the acceleration due to gravity).

(cid:1) Sealing and resistance to operating
mediums: Depending upon installation
position, the ECU must withstand damp,
chemicals (e.g. oils), and salt fog.

The above factors and other requirements
mean that the Bosch development engineers
are continually faced by new challenges.

278

Sensors

Automotive applications

Sensors

Sensors register operating states (e.g. engine
speed) and setpoint/desired values (e.g.
 accelerator-pedal position). They convert
physical quantities (e.g. pressure) or chemi-
cal quantities (e.g. exhaust-gas concen -
tration) into electric signals. 

Automotive applications

Sensors and actuators represent the interfaces
between the ECUs, as the processing units,
and the vehicle with its complex drive, brak-
ing, chassis, and bodywork functions (for in-
stance, the Engine Management, the Elec-
tronic Stability Program ESP, and the air con-
ditioner). As a rule, a matching circuit in the
sensor converts the signals so that they can be
processed by the ECU.

The field of mechatronics, in which mech -
anical, electronic, and data-processing
 components are interlinked and cooperate
closely with each other, is rapidly gaining in
importance in the field of sensor engineering.
These components are integrated in modules
(e.g. in the crankshaft CSWS (Composite Seal
with Sensor) module  complete with rpm sen-
sor).

1

Sensor integration levels

Since their output signals directly affect not
only the engine’s power output, torque, and
emissions, but also vehicle handling and
safety, sensors, although they are becoming
smaller and smaller, must also fulfill demands
that they be faster and more precise. These
stipulations can be complied with thanks to
mechatronics.

Depending upon the level of integration, sig-
nal conditioning, analog/digital conversion,
and self-calibration functions can all be inte-
grated in the sensor (Fig. 1), and in future a
small microcomputer for further signal pro-
cessing will be added. The advantages are as
follows: 

(cid:0) Lower levels of computing power are

needed in the ECU

(cid:0) A uniform, flexible, and bus-compatible 
interface becomes possible for all sensors

(cid:0) Direct multiple use of a given sensor

through the data bus

(cid:0) Registration of even smaller measured

quantities

Temperature sensors

Applications
Engine-temperature sensor
This is installed in the coolant circuit (Fig. 1).
The engine management uses its signal when
calculating the engine temperature (measur-
ing range –40…+130°C).

Exhaust-gas temperature sensor
This sensor is mounted on the exhaust system
at points which are particularly critical re-
garding temperature. It is applied in the
closed-loop control of the systems used for
exhaust-gas treatment. A platinum measuring
resistor is usually used (measuring range
–40…+1,000°C).

Air-temperature sensor
This sensor is installed in the air-intake tract.
Together with the signal from the boost-pres-
sure sensor, its signal is applied in calculating
the intake-air mass. Apart from this, desired
values for the various control loops (e.g. EGR,
boost-pressure control) can be adapted to the
air temperature (measuring range
–40…+120°C).

Engine-oil temperature sensor
The signal from this sensor is used in calcu-
lating the service interval (measuring range
–40…+170°C).

Fuel-temperature sensor
Is incorporated in the low-pressure stage of
the diesel fuel circuit. The fuel temperature is
used in calculating the precise injected fuel
quantity (measuring range –40…+120°C).

Design and operating concept
Depending upon the particular application, 
a wide variety of temperature sensor designs
are available. A temperature-dependent semi-
conductor measuring resistor is fitted inside a
housing. This resistor is usually of the NTC
(Negative Temperature Coefficient, Fig. 2)
type. Less often a PTC (Positive Temperature
Coefficient) type is used. With NTC, there is 
a sharp drop in  resistance when the tempera-
ture rises, and with PTC there is a sharp in-
crease.

The measuring resistor is part of a voltage-
divider circuit to which 5 V is applied. The
voltage measured across the measuring
 resistor is therefore temperature-dependent.
 It is inputted through an analog to digital
(A/D) converter and is a measure of the tem-
perature at the sensor. A characteristic curve
is stored in the engine-management ECU
which allocates a specific temperature to
every resistance or output-voltage.

Application
Manifold-pressure or boost-pressure sensor
This sensor measures the absolute pressure in
the intake manifold between the supercharger
and the engine (typically 250 kPa or 2.5 bar)
and compares it with a reference vacuum, not
with the ambient pressure. This enables the
air mass to be precisely defined, and the boost
pressure exactly controlled in accordance
with engine requirements. 

Atmospheric-pressure sensor
This sensor is also known as an ambient-
pressure sensor and is incorporated in the
ECU or fitted in the engine compartment. Its
signal is used for the altitude-dependent cor-
rection of the setpoint values for the control
loops. For instance, for the exhaust-gas recir-
culation (EGR) and for the boost-pressure
control. This enables the differing densities 
of the surrounding air to be taken into 
account. The atmospheric-pressure sensor
measures absolute pressure (60...115 kPa or
0.6...1.15 bar).

Oil and fuel-pressure sensor 
Oil-pressure sensors are installed in the oil
 filter and measure the oil’s absolute pressure.
This information is needed so that engine
loading can be determined as needed for the
Service Display. The pressure range here is
50...1,000 kPa or 0.5...10.0 bar. Due to its high
resistance to media, the measuring element
can also be used for pressure measurement 
in the fuel supply’s low-pressure stage. It is in-
stalled on or in the fuel filter. Its signal serves
for the monitoring of the fuel- filter contami-
nation (measuring range: 20... 400 kPa or
0.2...4 bar).

temperature influences, and linearise the
pressure curve. The output voltage is  between
0...5 V and is connected through  electrical
terminals (Fig. 4, 5) to the engine-manage-
ment ECU which uses this output voltage in
calculating the pressure (Fig. 5). 

Version with reference vacuum 
in  special chamber
Design and construction
The manifold or boost-pressure sensor version
with the reference vacuum in a special cham-
ber (Figs. 6 and 7) is easier to install than the
version with the reference vacuum on the

prised of a silicon chip (Fig. 1, 2) in which a
thin diaphragm has been etched microme-
chanically (1). Four deformation resistors
(R1, R2) are diffused on the dia phram. Their
electrical resistance changes when mechanical
force is applied. The measuring element is
surrounded on the component side by a cap
which at the same time encloses the reference
vacuum (Figs. 2 and 3). The pressure-sensor
case can also incorporate an integral tempera-
ture sensor (Fig. 4, 1) whose signals can be
evaluated independently. This means that at
any point a single sensor case suffices to mea-
sure temperature and pressure.

Method of operation
The sensor’s diaphragm deforms more or less
(10…1,000 µm) according to the pressure be-
ing measured. The four deformation resistors
on the diaphragm change their electrical re-
sistances as a function of the  mechanical
stress resulting from the applied pressure
(piezoresistive effect). 

The four measuring resistors are arranged
on the silicon chip so that when diaphragm
deformation takes place, the resistance of two
of them increases and that of the other two
decreases. These deformation resistors form a
Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 1, 5), and a change in
their resistances leads to a change in the ratio
of the voltages across them. 
This leads to a change in the measurement
voltage UM. This unamplified voltage is there-
fore a measure of the pressure applied to the
diaphragm. 

The measurement voltage is higher with a

bridge circuit than would be the case when
using an individual resistor. The Wheatstone
bridge circuit thus permits a higher sensor
sensitivity. 

The component side of the sensor to which
pressure is not supplied is subjected to a ref-
erence vacuum (Fig. 2, 2) so that it measures
the absolute pressure. 

The signal-conditioning electronics circuitry
is integrated on the chip. Its assignment is to
amplify the bridge voltage, compensate for

components side of the sensor element. Simi-
lar to the pressure sensor with cap and refer-
ence vacuum on the components side of the
sensor element, the sensor element here is
formed from a silicon chip with four etched
deformation resistors in a bridge circuit. It is
attached to a glass base. In contrast to the
sensor with the reference vacuum on the
components side, there is no passage in the
glass base through which the measured pres-
sure can be applied to the sensor element. In-
stead, pressure is applied to the silicon chip
from the side on which the evaluation elec-

tronics is situated. This means that a special
gel must be used at this side of the sensor to
protect it against en vironmental influences
(Fig. 8, 1). The reference vacuum is enclosed
in the chamber between the silicon chip (6)
and the glass base (3). The complete measur-
ing element  is mounted on a ceramic hybrid
(4) which  incorporates the soldering surfaces
for  electrical contacting inside the sensor. 

A temperature sensor can also be incorporated
in the pressure-sensor case. It protrudes into
the air flow, and can therefore respond to
temperature changes with a  minimum of 
delay (Fig. 6, 4). 

Operating concept
The operating concept, and with it the signal
conditioning and signal amplification to-
gether with the characteristic curve, corre-
sponds to that used in the pressure sensor
with cap and reference vacuum on the sen-
sor’s structure side.The only difference is 
that the measuring element’s diaphragm 
is deformed in the opposite direction and
therefore the deformation resistors are “bent”
in the other direction.

High-pressure sensors

Application
In automotive applications, high-pressure
sensors are used for measuring the pressures
of fuels and brake fluids.

Diesel rail-pressure sensor
In the diesel engine, the rail-pressure sensor
measures the pressure in the fuel rail of the
Common Rail accumulator-type injection
system. Maximum operating (nominal) 
pressure pmax is 160 MPa (1,600 bar). 
The fuel pressure is regulated in a control
loop, and remains practically constant inde-
pendent of load and engine speed. 
Any deviations from the setpoint pressure 
are compensated for by a pressure control
valve.

Gasoline rail-pressure sensor
As its name implies, this sensor measures the
pressure in the fuel rail of the DI Motronic
with gasoline direct injection. Pressure is a
function of load and engine speed and is 
5...12 MPa (50...120 bar), and is used as an 
actual (measured) value in the closed-loop
rail-pressure control. The rpm and load-
 dependent setpoint value is stored in a map
and is adjusted at the rail by a pressure con-
trol valve.

Brake-fluid pressure sensor
Installed in the hydraulic modulator of such
driving-safety systems as ESP, this high-
 pressure sensor is used to measure the brake-
fluid pressure which is usually 25 MPa
(250 bar). Maximum pressure pmax can climb
to as much as 35 MPa (350 bar).  Pressure
measurement and monitoring is triggered 
by the ECU which also evaluates the return
signals.

Design and operating concept
The heart of the sensor is a steel diaphragm
onto which deformation resistors have been
vapor-deposited in the form of a bridge
 circuit (Fig. 1, 3). The sensor’s measuring
range is a function of diaphragm thickness

(thicker diaphragms for higher pressures,
thinner diaphragms for lower pressures).
When the pressure is applied via the pressure
connection (4) to one of the diaphragm faces,
the resistances of the bridge resistors change
due to diaphragm deformation (approx.
20 µm at 1,500 bar). 

The 0...80 mV output voltage generated by
the bridge is conducted to an evaluation cir-
cuit (2) which amplifies it to 0...5 V. This is
used as the input to the ECU which refers to a
stored characteristic curve in calculating the
pressure (Fig. 2).

Inductive engine-speed
 sensors

Applications
Such engine-speed sensors are used for
 measuring:
(cid:0) Engine rpm
(cid:0) Crankshaft position (for information on

the position of the engine pistons) 

The rotational speed is calculated from the
sensor’s signal frequency. The output signal
from the rotational-speed sensor is one of the
most important quantities in electronic en-
gine management. 

Design and operating concept
The sensor is mounted directly opposite a 
ferromagnetic trigger wheel (Fig. 1, 7) from
which it is separated by a narrow air gap. 
It has a soft-iron core (pole pin) (4), which is
enclosed by the solenoid winding (5). The
pole pin is also connected to a permanent
magnet (1), and a magnetic field  extends
through the pole pin and into the trigger
wheel. The level of the magnetic flux through
the winding depends upon whether the sen-
sor is opposite a trigger-wheel tooth or gap.
Whereas the magnet’s stray flux is concen-
trated by a tooth and leads to an increase in
the working flux through the winding, it is
weakened by a gap. When the trigger wheel
rotates therefore, this causes a fluctuation of
the flux which in turn generates a sinusoidal
voltage in the solenoid winding which is pro-

portional to the rate of change of the flux
(Fig. 2). The amplitude of the AC voltage in-
creases strongly along with increasing trigger-
wheel speed (several mV...>100 V). At least
about 30 rpm are needed to generate an 
adequate signal level. 

The number of teeth on the trigger wheel 
depends upon the particular application. 
On solenoid-valve-controlled engine-man-
agement systems for instance, a 60-pitch trig-
ger wheel is normally used, although 2 teeth
are omitted (7) so that the trigger wheel has
60 – 2 = 58 teeth. The very large tooth gap 
is allocated to a defined crankshaft position
and serves as a reference mark for synchro-
nizing the ECU. 

There is another version of the trigger
wheel which has one tooth per engine cylin-
der. In the case of a 4-cylinder engine, there-
fore, the trigger wheel has 4 teeth, and
4 pulses are generated per revolution. 

The geometries of the trigger-wheel teeth

and the pole pin must be matched to each
other. The evaluation-electronics circuitry 
in the ECU converts the sinusoidal voltage,
which is characterized by strongly varying
amplitudes, into a constant-amplitude
square-wave voltage for evaluation in the
ECU microcontroller.

Rotational-speed (rpm) sensors and incremental angle-of-rotation sensors

285

Magnetoresistors are magnetically control-
lable semiconductor resistors, and similar 
in design to Hall-effect sensors. The  double
differential sensor has four resistors con-
nected to form a full bridge circuit. 

The sensor has a permanent magnet, and
the magnet’s pole face opposite the toothed
pulse disc is homegenized by a thin ferromag-
netic wafer on which are mounted the four
magnetoresistors, separated from each 
other by half a tooth gap. This means that
 alternately there are two magnetoresistors 
opposite tooth gaps and two opposite teeth
(Fig. 1). The magnetoresistors for automotive
applications are designed for operation in
temperatures of ≤ 170°C (≤ 200°C briefly).

S

Rotation-speed/angle-of-rotation sensor (as installed)

Rotational-speed (rpm)
 sensors and incremental
 angle-of-rotation sensors
Application
The above sensors are installed in distributor-
type diesel injection pumps with solen oid-
valve control. Their signals are used for:
(cid:0) The measurement of the injection pump’s

speed

(cid:0) Determining the instantaneous angular 

position of pump and camshaft

(cid:0) Measurement of the instantaneous setting

of the timing device

The pump speed at a given instant is one of
the input variables to the distributor pump’s
ECU which uses it to calculate the triggering
time for the high-pressure solenoid valve,
and, if necessary, for the timing-device solen -
oid valve.

The triggering time for the high-pressure 
solenoid valve must be calculated in order to
inject the appropriate fuel quantity for the par-
ticular operating conditions. The cam plate’s
instantaneous angular setting defines the trig-
gering point for the high-pressure solenoid
valve. Only when triggering takes place at 
exactly the right cam-plate angle, can it be
guaranteed that the opening and closing points
for the high-pressure solenoid valve are correct
for the particular cam lift. Precise triggering 
defines the correct start-of-injection point and
the correct injected fuel quantity.

The correct timing-device setting as needed

for timing-device control is ascertained by
comparing the signals from the camshaft rpm
sensor with those of the  angle-of-rotation
sensor. 

Design and operating concept
The rpm sensor, or the angle-of-rotation sen-
sor, scans a toothed pulse disc with 120 teeth
which is attached to the distributor pump’s
driveshaft. There are tooth gaps, the number
of which correspond to the number of engine
cylinders, evenly spaced around the disc’s cir-
cumference. A double differential magnetore-
sistive sensor is used.

Sensors

Hall-effect phase sensors

Hall-effect phase sensors

Application
The engine’s camshaft rotates at half the
crankshaft speed. Taking a given piston on 
its way to TDC, the camshaft’s rotational
 position is an indication as to whether the
piston is in the compression or exhaust
stroke. The phase sensor on the camshaft 
provides the ECU with this information. 

Design and operating concept

Hall-effect rod sensors
As the name implies, such sensors (Fig. 2a)
make use of the Hall effect. A ferromagnetic
trigger wheel (with teeth, segments, or  per -
forated rotor, 7) rotates with the camshaft.
The Hall-effect IC is located between the trig-
ger wheel and a permanent magnet (5) which
generates a magnetic field strength perpen-
dicular to the Hall  element. 

If one of the trigger-wheel teeth (Z) now
passes the current-carrying rod-sensor ele-
ment (semiconductor wafer), it changes the
magnetic field strength perpendicular to 
the Hall element. This causes the electrons,
which are driven by a longitudinal voltage
across the element to be deflected perpendic-
ularly to the direction of current (Fig. 1, 
angle α). 

age) which is in the millivolt range, and
which is independent of the relative speed be-
tween sensor and trigger wheel. The evalua-
tion electronics integrated in the sensor’s Hall
IC conditions the signal and outputs it in the
form of a rectangular-pulse signal (Fig. 2b
“High”/“Low”).

Differential Hall-effect rod sensors
Rod sensors operating as per the differential
principle are provided with two Hall ele-
ments. These elements are offset from each
other either radially or axially (Fig. 3, S1 and
S2), and generate an output signal which is
proportional to the difference in magnetic
flux at the element measuring points. A two-
track perforated plate (Fig. 3a) or a two-track

trigger wheel (Fig. 3b) are needed in order 
to generate the opposing signals in the Hall
elements (Fig. 4) as needed for this measure-
ment. 

Such sensors are used when particularly se-
vere demands are made on accuracy. Further
advantages are their relatively wide air-gap
range and good temperature-compensation
characteristics.

Accelerator-pedal sensors

Accelerator-pedal sensors

Application
In conventional engine-management systems,
the driver transmits his/her wishes for accel-
eration, constant speed, or lower speed, to the
engine by using the accelerator pedal to inter-
vene mechanically at the throttle plate (gaso-
line engine) or at the injection pump (diesel
engine). Intervention is transmitted from the
accelerator pedal to the throttle plate or injec-
tion pump by means of a Bowden cable or
linkage.

On today’s electronic engine-management
systems, the Bowden cable and/or linkage have
been superseded, and the driver’s accelerator-
pedal inputs are transmitted to the ECU by an

accelerator-pedal sensor which registers the ac-
celerator-pedal travel, or the pedal’s angular
setting, and sends this to the engine ECU in
the form of an electric signal. This system is
also known as “drive-by-wire”. 
The accelerator-pedal module (Figs. 2b, 2c) 
is available as an alternative to the individual
accelerator-pedal sensor (Fig. 2a). These mod-
ules are ready-to-install units comprising ac-
celerator pedal and sensor, and make adjust-
ments on the vehicle a thing of the past. 

Design and operating concept
Potentiometer-type accelerator-pedal sensor
The heart of this sensor is the potentiometer
across which a voltage is developed which is a
function of the accelerator-pedal setting. In
the ECU, a programmed characteristic curve
is applied in order to calculate the accelera-
tor-pedal travel, or its angular setting, from
this voltage.

A second (redundant) sensor is incorporated
for diagnosis purposes and for use in case of
malfunctions. It is a component part of the
monitoring system. One version of the accel-
erator-pedal sensor operates with a second
potentiometer. The voltage across this poten-
tiometer is always half of that across the first
potentiometer. This provides two indepen-
dent signals which are used for trouble-
shooting (Fig. 1). Instead of the second po-
tentiometer, another version uses a low-idle
switch which provides a signal for the ECU
when the accelerator pedal is in the idle posi-

further switch can be incorporated for a kick-
down signal.

Mechanically, this sensor is highly suitable for
installation in an accelerator-pedal  module
(Fig. 5).

Hall-effect angle-of-rotation sensor ARS1

Hall-effect angle-of-rotation sensors
The ARS1 (Angle of Rotation Sensor) is
based on the movable-magnet principle. 
It has a measuring range of approx. 90° 
(Figs. 3 and 4). 

A semicircular permanent-magnet disc ro-
tor (Fig. 4, 1) generates a magnetic flux which
is returned back to the rotor via a pole shoe
(2), magnetically soft conductive elements (3)
and shaft (6). In the process, the amount of
flux which is returned through the conduc-
tive elements is a function of the rotor’s angle
of rotation (cid:0). There is a Hall-effect sensor (5)
located in the magnetic path of each conduc-
tive element, so that it is possible to generate
a practically linear characteristic curve
throughout the measuring range.

The ARS2 is a simpler design without mag-
netically soft conductive elements. Here, a
magnet rotates around the Hall-effect sensor.
The path it takes describes a circular arc.
Since only a small section of the resulting
 sinusoidal characteristic curve features good
linearity, the Hall-effect sensor is  located
slightly outside the center of the arc. This
causes the curve to deviate from its sinusoidal
form so that the curve’s linear section is in-
creased to more than 180°.

Hot-film air-mass meter HFM5

Hot-film air-mass meter
HFM5

Application
For optimal combustion as needed to comply
with the emission regulations imposed by leg-
islation, it is imperative that precisely the nec-
essary air mass is inducted, irrespective of the
engine’s operating state. 

To this end, part of the total air flow which

is actually inducted through the air filter or
the measuring tube is measured by a hot-film
air-mass meter. Measurement is very precise
and takes into account the pulsations and re-
verse flows caused by the opening and closing
of the engine’s intake and exhaust valves. In-
take-air temperature changes have no effect
upon measuring  accuracy.

Design and construction
The housing of the HFM5 Hot-Film Air-
Mass Meter (Fig. 1, 5) projects into a measur-
ing tube (2) which, depending upon the 
engine's air-mass requirements, can have a
var iety of diameters (for 370...970 kg/h).

This tube is installed in the intake tract
downstream from the air filter. Plug-in ver-
sions are also available which are installed 
inside the air filter. 

The most important components in the
sensor are the sensor element (4), in the air
intake (8), and the integrated evaluation elec-
tronics (3). The partial air flow as required
for measurement flows across this  sensor 
element. 

Vapor-deposition is used to apply the sensor-
element components to a semiconductor sub-
strate, and the evaluation-electronics (hybrid
circuit) components to a ceramic substrate.
This principle permits very compact design.
The evaluation electronics are connected to
the ECU through the plug-in connection (1).
The partial-flow measuring tube (6) is shaped
so that the air flows past the sensor element
smoothly (without whirl effects) and back
into the measuring tube via the air outlet (7).
This method ensures efficient sensor opera-
tion even in case of extreme pulsation, and in
addition to forward flow, reverse flows are
also detected (Fig. 2).

Operating concept
The hot-film air-mass meter is a “thermal
sensor” and operates according to the follow-
ing principle:

A micromechanical sensor diaphragm (Fig. 3,
5) on the sensor element (3) is heated by a
centrally mounted heater resistor and held at
a constant temperature. The temperature
drops sharply on each side of this controlled
heating zone (4).

The temperature distribution on the dia -
phragm is registered by two temperature-
dependent resistors which are mounted up-
stream and downstream of the heater resistor
so as to be symmetrical to it (measuring
points M1, M2).  Without the flow of incoming
air, the temperature characteristic (1) is 
the same on each side of the heating zone 
(T1 = T2). 

As soon as air flows over the sensor element,
the uniform temperature distribution at the
diaphragm changes (2). On the intake side,
the temperature characteristic is steeper since
the incoming air flowing past this area cools
it off. Initially, on the opposite side (the side
nearest to the engine), the sensor element
cools off. The air heated by the heater element
then heats up the sensor element. The change
in temperature distribution leads to a tem-
perature differential (∆T) between the mea-
suring points M1 und M2.

The heat dissipated to the air, and therefore
the temperature characteristic at the sensor
element is a function of the air mass flow. In-
dependent of the absolute temperature of the
air flowing past, the temperature differential
is a measure of the air mass flow. Apart from
this, the temperature differential is direc-
tional, which means that the air-mass meter
not only registers the mass of the incoming
air but also its direction. 

Due to its very thin micromechanical 
dia phragm, the sensor has a highly dynamic
response (<15 ms), a point which is of partic-
ular importance when the incoming air is
pulsating heavily. 

The evaluation electronics (hybrid circuit)
integrated in the sensor convert the resistance
differential at the measuring points M1 and
M2 into an analog signal of 0...5 V which is
suitable for processing by the ECU. Using the
sensor characteristic (Fig. 2) programmed
into the ECU, the measured voltage is con-
verted into a value representing the air mass
flow [kg/h]. 

The shape of the characteristic curve is such
that the diagnosis facility incorporated in the
ECU can detect such malfunctions as an
open-circuit line. A temperature sensor for
auxiliary functions can also be integrated in
the HFM5. It is located on the sensor element
upstream of the heated zone.

Application
As its name implies, the broad-band Lambda
oxygen sensor is used across a very extensive
range to determine the oxygen concentration
in the exhaust gas. The figures provided by
the sensor are an indication of the air-fuel
(A/F) ratio in the engine’s combustion cham-
ber. The excess-air factor λ is used when
defining the A/F ratio. Broad-band Lambda
sensors make precise measurements not only
at the stoichiometic point λ = 1, but also in
the lean range (λ>1) and in the rich range
(λ<1). In combination with electronic closed-
loop control circuitry, these sensors generate
an unmistakable, continuous electrical signal
(Fig. 2) in the range from 0.7 < λ< ∞ (= air
with 21% O2). 

These characteristics enable the broad-band
Lambda sensor to be used not only in gaso-
line-engine-management systems with two-
step control (λ = 1), but also in control con-
cepts with rich and lean air-fuel (A/F) mix-
tures. This type of Lambda sensor is therefore
also suitable for the Lambda closed-loop con-
trol used with lean-burn concepts on gasoline
engines, as well as for diesel engines, gaseous-
fuel engines and gas-powered central heaters

and water heaters (this wide range of applica-
tions led to the designation LSU: Lambda
Sensor Universal (taken from the German), 
in other words Universal Lambda Sensor).

The sensor protrudes into the exhaust pipe
and detects the flow of exhaust-gas flow from
all cylinders. 
In a number of systems, several Lambda sen-
sors are installed for even greater accuracy.
Here, for instance, they are fitted in the indi-
vidual exhaust tracts of V-engines.

Design and construction
The LSU4 broad-band Lambda sensor
(Fig. 3) is a planar dual-cell limit-current sen-
sor. It features a zirconium-dioxide/ceramic
(ZrO2) measuring cell (Fig. 1), which is the
combination of a Nernst concentration cell
(sensor cell which functions in the same way
as a two-step Lambda sensor) and an oxygen-
pump cell for transporting the oxygen ions. 
The oxygen pump cell (Fig. 1, 8) is so
arranged with respect to the Nernst concen-
tration cell (7) that there is a 10...50 µm diffu-
sion gap (6) The gap is connected to the ex-
haust gas through a gas-access passage (10).
The porous diffusion barrier (11) serves to
limit the inflow of oxygen molecules from the
exhaust gas.

the pump cell pumps the oxygen to the out-
side (positive pump current). On the other
hand, if it is rich, due to the decomposition of
CO2 and H2O at the exhaust-gas electrode the
oxygen is pumped from the surrounding ex-
haust gas and into the diffusion gap (negative
pump current). Oxygen transport is unneces-
sary at λ = 1 and pump current is zero. The
pump current is proportional to the exhaust-
gas oxygen concentration and is this a non-
linear measure for the excess-air factor λ
(Fig. 2).

2

Pump current IP of a broad-band Lambda sensor as 
a function of the exhaust-gas excess-air factor (λ)

On the one side, the Nernst concentration cell
is connected to the atmosphere by a refer-
ence-air passage (5), on the other it is con-
nected to the exhaust gas in the diffusion gap.

The sensor must have heated up to at least
600...800°C before it generates a usable signal.
It is provided with an integral heater (3), so
that the required temperature is reached
quickly.

Method of operation
The exhaust gas enters the actual measuring
chamber (diffusion gap) of the Nernst con-
centration cell through the pump cell’s gas-
access passage. In order that the excess-air
factor λ can be adjusted in the diffusion gap,
the Nernst concentration cell compares the
gas in the diffusion gap with that in the refer-
ence-air passage.

The complete process proceeds as follows: 
By applying the pump voltage UP across
the pump cell’s platinum electrodes, oxygen
from the exhaust gas can be pumped into or
out of the diffusion gap. With the help of the
Nernst concentration cell, an electronic cir-
cuit in the ECU controls the voltage (UP)
across the pump cell in order that the compo-
sition of the gas in the diffusion gap  remains
constant at λ = 1. If the exhaust gas is lean,

Sensors

Half-differential short-circuiting-ring sensors

Half-differential short-
 circuiting-ring sensors

Application
These sensors are also known as HDK (taken
from the German) sensors, and are applied as
position sensors for travel or  angle, They are
wear-free, as well as being very precise, and
very robust, and are used as: 
(cid:0) Rack-travel sensors (RWG) for measuring
the control-rack setting on in-line diesel
injection pumps, and as 

(cid:0) Angle-of-rotation sensors in the injected-

fuel-quantity actuators of diesel  distribu tor
pumps

Design and operating concept
These sensors (Figs. 1 and 2) are comprised of
a laminated soft-iron core on each limb of
which are wound a measuring coil and a ref-
erence coil.

Alternating magnetic fields are generated
when the alternating current from the ECU
flows through these coils. The copper rings
surrounding the limbs of the soft-iron cores
screen the cores, though, against the effects of
the magnetic fields. Whereas the reference
short-circuiting rings are fixed in position,
the measuring short-circuiting rings are at-
tached to the control rack or control-collar
shaft (in-line pumps and distributor pumps
respectively), with which they are free to
move (control-rack travel s, or adjustment
angle (cid:0)). 

When the measuring short-circuiting ring
moves along with the control rack or control-
collar shaft, the magnetic flux changes and,
since the ECU maintains the current constant
(load-independent current), the voltage
across the coil also changes.

The ratio of the output voltage UA to the ref-
erence voltage URef (Fig. 3) is calculated by an
evaluation circuit. This ratio is proportional
to the deflection of the measuring short-cir-
cuiting ring, and is processed by the ECU.
Bending the reference short-circuiting ring
adjusts the gradient of the characteristic
curve, and the basic position of the measur-
ing short-circuiting ring defines the zero
 position.

Fuel-level sensor

295

Fuel-level sensor

Fuel-level sensor installed in a fuel tank

Application
It is the job of the fuel-level sensor to register
the level of the fuel in the tank and send the
appropriate signal to the ECU or to the dis-
play device in the vehicle’s instrument panel.
Together with the electric fuel pump and the
fuel filter, it is part of the in-tank unit. These
are installed in the fuel tank (gasoline or
diesel fuel) and provide for an efficient supply
of clean fuel to the engine (Fig. 1). 

Design and construction
The fuel-level sensor (Fig. 2) is comprised 
of a potentiometer with wiper arm (wiper
spring), printed conductors (twin-contact),
resistor board (pcb), and electrical connec-
tions. The complete sensor unit is encapsu-
lated and sealed against fuel. The float (fuel-
resistant Nitrophyl) is attached to one end 
of the wiper lever, the other end of which is
fixed to the rotatable potentiometer shaft
(and therefore also to the wiper spring).
 Depending upon the particular version, the
float can be either fixed in position on the
lever, or it can be free to rotate). The layout of
the resistor board (pcb) and the shape of the
float lever and float are matched to the partic-
ular fuel-tank design.

Operating concept 
The potentiometer’s wiper spring is fixed to
the float lever by a pin. Special wipers (con-
tact rivets) provide the contact between the
wiper spring and the potentiometer resistance
tracks, and when the fuel level changes the
wipers move along these tracks and generate
a voltage ratio which is proportional to the
float’s angle of rotation. End stops limit the
rotation range of 100° for maximum and
minimum levels as well as preventing noise. 

Operating voltage is 5...13 V.

Fault diagnostics

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Monitoring during 
vehicle  operation
(on-board  diagnosis)
Overview
ECU-integrated diagnostics belong to the ba-
sic scope of electronic engine-management
systems. Besides a self-test of the  control unit,
input and output signals, and control-unit 
intercommunication are monitored.

On-board diagnosis of an electronic system

is the capability of a control unit to interpret
and perform self-monitoring using “software
intelligence”, i.e. detect, store, and diagnosti-
cally interpret errors and faults. On-board 
diagnosis runs without the use of any addi-
tional equipment.

Monitoring algorithms check input and
output signals during vehicle operation, and
check the entire system and all its functions
for malfunctions and disturbances. Any er-
rors or faults detected are stored in the con-
trol-unit fault memory. Stored fault informa-
tion can be read out via a serial interface.

Fault diagnostics

The rise in the sheer amount of electronics 
in the automobile, the use of software to con-
trol the vehicle, and the increased complexity
of modern fuel-injection systems place 
high demands on the diagnostic concept,
monitoring during vehicle operation
(on-board diagnosis), and workshop diag-
nostics (Fig. 1). The workshop diagnostics 
is based on a guided troubleshooting proce-
dure that links the many possibilities of on-
board and offboard test procedures and test
equipment. As emission-control legislation
becomes more and more stringent and con-
tinuous monitoring is now called for, law-
makers have now acknowledged on-board 
diagnosis as an aid to monitoring exhaust-
gas emissions, and have produced manufac-
turer-independent standardization. This
 additional system is termed the on-board
 diagnostic system.

Fault diagnostics

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

297

Input-signal monitoring
Sensors, plug connectors, and connecting
lines (signal path) to the control unit (Fig. 2)
are monitored by evaluating the input signal.
This monitoring strategy is capable of detect-
ing sensor errors, short-circuits in the bat-
tery-power circuit UBatt and vehicle-ground
circuit, and line breaks. The following 
methods are applied:
(cid:1) Monitoring sensor supply voltage (if 

applicable).

(cid:1) Monitoring detected values for permissible

value ranges (e.g. 0.5....4.5 V).

(cid:1) If additional information is available, a

plausibility check is conducted using the
detected value (e.g. comparison of crank-
shaft speed and camshaft speed).

(cid:1) Critical sensors (e.g. pedal-travel sensor)
are fitted in redundant configuration,
which means that their signals can be
 directly compared with each other.

Output-signal monitoring
Actuators triggered by a control unit via out-
put stages (Fig. 2) are monitored. The moni-
toring functions detects line breaks and
short-circuits in addition to actuator faults.
The following methods are applied:
(cid:1) Monitoring an output signal by the output
stage. The electric circuit is monitored for
short-circuits to battery voltage UBatt, to 
vehicle ground, and for open circuit.
(cid:1) Impacts on the system by the actuator 
are detected directly or indirectly by a 
function or plausibility monitor. System
actuators, e.g. exhaust-gas recirculation
valves, throttle valves, or swirl flaps, are
monitored indirectly via closed-control
loops (e.g. continuous control variance),
and also partly by means of position sen-
sors (e.g. position of turbine geometry in
the exhaust-gas turbocharger).

Fault diagnostics

Monitoring during vehicle operation (on-board diagnosis)

Error handling
Error detection
A signal path is categorized at finally defective
if an error occurs over a definite period of
time. Until the defect is categorized, the sys-
tem uses the last valid value detected. When
the defect is categorized, a standby function is
triggered (e.g. engine-temperature substitute
value T = 90°C).

Most errors can be rectified or detected 
as intact during vehicle operation, provided
the signal path remains intact for a definite
period of time.

Fault storage
Each fault is stored as a fault code in the 
non-volatile area of the data memory. 
The fault code also describes the fault type
(e.g. short-circuit, line break, plausibility,
value range exceeded). Each fault-code input
is accompanied by additional information,
e.g. the operating and environmental con -
ditions (freeze frame) at the time of fault
 occurrence (e.g. engine speed, engine temper-
ature). 

Limp-home function
If a fault is detected, limp-home strategies can
be triggered in addition to substitute values
(e.g. engine output power or speed limited).
These strategies help to: 
(cid:1) Maintain driving safety
(cid:1) Avoid consequential damage
(cid:1) Minimize exhaust-gas emissions

Monitoring internal ECU functions
Monitoring functions are implemented in
control-unit hardware (e.g. “intelligent” out-
put-stage modules) and software to ensure
that the control unit functions correctly at all
times. The monitoring functions check each
of the control-unit components (e.g. micro-
controller, flash EPROM, RAM). 
Many tests are conducted immediately after
startup. Other monitoring functions are
 performed during normal operation and re-
peated at regular intervals in order to detect
component failure during operation. Test
runs that require intensive CPU capacity, or
that cannot be performed during vehicle op-
eration for other reasons, are conducted in af-
ter-run more when the engine is switched off.
This method ensures that the other functions
are not interfered with. In the common-rail
system for diesel engines, functions such as
the injector switchoff paths are tested during
engine runup or  after-run. With a spark-igni-
tion engine, functions such as the flash
EPROM are tested in engine after-run.

Monitoring ECU communication
As a rule, communication with other ECUs
takes place over the CAN bus (Controller
Area Network). The CAN protocol contains
control mechanisms to detect malfunctions.
As a result, transmission errors are even de-
tectable at CAN-module level. A number of
other checks are also performed in the ECU.
Since the majority of CAN messages are sent
at regular intervals by the individual control
units, the failure of a CAN controller in a
control unit is detectable by testing at regular
intervals. In addition, when redundant infor-
mation is available in the ECU, the received
signals are checked in the same way as all in-
put signals.

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

299

On-board diagnosis system 
for passenger cars and 
light-duty trucks
The engine system and its components must
be constantly monitored in order to comply
with exhaust-gas emission limits specified by
law in everyday driving situations. For this
reason, regulations have come into force to
monitor exhaust-gas systems and compo-
nents, e.g. in California. This has standard-
ized and expanded manufacturer-specific on-
board diagnosis with respect to the monitor-
ing of emission-related components and sys-
tems.

Legislation
OBD I (CARB)
1988 marked the coming into force of OBD I
in California, that is, the first stage of CARB
legislation (California Air Resources Board).
The first OBD stage makes the following re-
quirements:
(cid:1) Monitoring emission-related electrical

components (short-circuits, line breaks)
and storage of faults in the control-unit
fault memory.

(cid:1) A Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) that

alerts the driver to the malfunction.
(cid:1) The defective component must be dis-

played by means of on-board equipment
(e.g. blink code using a diagnosis lamp).

OBD II (CARB)
The second stage of the diagnosis legislation
(OBD II) came into force in California in
1994. OBD II became mandatory for diesel-
engine cars with effect from 1996. In addition
to the scope of OBD I, system functionality
was now monitored (e.g. plausibility check of
sensor signals).

OBD II stipulates that all emission-related
systems and components must be monitored
if they cause an increase in toxic exhaust-gas
emissions in the event of a malfunction (by
exceeding the OBD limits). Moreover, all
components must be monitored if they are

used to monitor emission-related compo-
nents or if they can affect the diagnosis re-
sults.

Normally, the diagnostic functions for all
components and systems under surveillance
must run at least once during the exhaust-gas
test cycle (e.g. FTP 75). A further stipulation
is that all diagnostic functions must run with
sufficient frequency during daily driving
mode. For many monitoring functions, the
law defines a monitoring frequency (In 
Use Monitor Performance Ratio) in daily 
operation starting model year 2005.

Since the introduction of OBD II, the law
has been revised in several stages (updates).
The last update came into force in model year
2004. Further updates have been announced.

OBD (EPA)
Since 1994 the laws of the EPA (Environmen-
tal Protection Agency) have been in force in
the remaining U.S. states. The scope of these
diagnostics comply for the most part with 
the CARB legislation (OBD II). 

The OBD regulations for CARB and 
EPA apply to all passenger cars with up to
12 seats and to light-duty trucks weighing up
to 14,000 lbs (6.35 t).

EOBD (EU)
The OBD attuned to European conditions is
termed EOBD and is based on the EPA-OBD. 
EOBD has been valid for all passenger cars
and light-duty trucks equipped with gasoline
engines and weighing up to 3.5 t with up to 
9 seats since January 2000. Since January 2003
the EOBD also applies to passenger cars and
light-duty trucks with diesel engines.

Other countries
A number of other countries have already
adopted or are planning to adopt EU or
US-OBD legislation.

300

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Requirements of the OBD system
The ECU must use suitable measures to mon-
itor all on-board systems and components
whose malfunction may cause a deterioration
in exhaust-gas test specifications stipulated by
law. The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
must alert the driver to a malfunction if the
malfunction could cause an overshoot in
OBD emission limits.

Emission limits
The U.S. OBD II (CARB and EPA) prescribes
thresholds that are defined relative to emis-
sion limits. Accordingly, there are  different
permissible OBD emission limits for the vari-
ous exhaust-gas categories that are applied
during vehicle certification (e.g. TIER, LEV,
ULEV). Absolute limits apply in Europe
(Table 1).

Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL)
alerts the driver that a component has mal-
functioned. When a malfunction is detected,
CARB and EPA stipulate that the MIL must
light up no later than after two driving cycles
of its occurrence. Within the scope of EOBD,
the MIL must light up no later than in the
third driving cycle with a detected malfunc-
tion. 

If the malfunction disappears (e.g. loose
contact), the malfunction remains entered in
the fault memory for 40 trips (warmup cy-
cles). The MIL goes out after three fault-free
driving cycles.

Communication with scan tool
OBD legislation prescribes standardization of
the fault-memory information and access to
the information (connector, communication
interface) compliant with ISO 15 031 and the
corresponding SAE standards (Society of Au-
tomotive Engineers). This permits the read-
out of the fault memory using standardized,
commercially available testers (scan tools, see
Fig. 1).

Depending on their scope of application,
various communication protocols are used
throughout the world: The most important
are:
(cid:1) ISO 9141-2 for European passenger cars.
(cid:1) SAE J 1850 for U.S. passenger cars.
(cid:1) ISO 14 230-4 (KWP 2000) for European
passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
(cid:1) SAE J 1708 for U.S. commercial vehicles.

These serial interfaces operate at a bit rate
(baud rate) of 5 to 10 k baud. They are de-
signed as a single-wire interface with a com-
mon wire for both transmission and recep-
tion, or as a two-wire interface with a sepa-
rate data line (K-line) and initiate line
(L-line). Several electronic control units (such
as Motronic, ESP, or EDC, and transmission-
shift control, etc.) can be combined on one
diagnosis connector.

Communication between the tester and

ECU is set up in three phases:
(cid:1) Initiate the ECU.
(cid:1) Detect and generate baud rate.
(cid:1) Read key bytes which identify the transmis-

sion protocol.

Evaluation is performed subsequently. 
The following functions are possible: 
(cid:1) Identify the ECU 
(cid:1) Read the fault memory 
(cid:1) Erase the fault memory 
(cid:1) Read the actual values 

In future, the CAN bus (ISO 15 765-4) will be
used increasingly to handle communication
between ECUs and the tester. Starting 2008
diagnostics will only be permitted over this
interface in the U.S.A.

To make it easier to read out the ECU fault-
memory information, a standardized diagno-
sis socket will be fitted at an easily  accessible
place in every car (easy to reach from the 
driver’s seat). The socket is used to connect
the scan tool (Fig. 2). 

Reading the fault information
Any workshop can use the scan tool to read
out emission-relevant fault information from
the ECU (Fig. 3). In this way, workshops not
franchized to a particular manufacturer are
also able to carry out repairs. Manufacturers
are obliged to make the  required tools and 
information available (on the internet) in 
return for a reasonable payment, to allow
this.

Vehicle recall
If vehicles fail to comply with OBD require-
ments by law, the authorities may demand the
vehicle manufacturer to start a recall at his
own cost.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Temporary disabling of diagnostic functions
Diagnostic capabilities may only be disabled
under certain conditions in order to prevent
false diagnosis. Examples include:
(cid:1) Height too large.
(cid:1) Low ambient temperature at engine

switchon. 

(cid:1) Low battery voltage.

Readiness code
When the fault memory is checked, it is im-
portant to know that the diagnostic capabili-
ties ran at least once. This can be checked by
reading out the readiness code over the diag-
nostic interface. After erasing the fault mem-
ory in service, the readiness codes must be 
reset after checking the functions.

Diagnostic System Management (DSM)
The diagnostic capabilities for all compo-
nents and systems checked must normally
run in driving mode, but at least once during
the exhaust-gas test cycle (e.g. FTP 75,
NEDC). Diagnostic System Management
(DSM) can change the sequence for running
the diagnostic capabilities dynamically,
 depending on driving conditions.

The DSM comprises the following three

components (Fig. 4):

Diagnosis Fault Path Management (DFPM)
The primary role of DFPM is to store fault
states that are detected in the system. In addi-
tion to faults, it also stores other information,
such as environmental conditions (freeze
frame).

Functional requirements
Overview
Just as for on-board diagnosis, all ECU input
and output signals, as well as the components
themselves, must be monitored. 

Legislation demands the monitoring of

electrical functions (short-circuit, line
breaks), a plausibility check for sensors, 
and a function monitoring for actuators.

The pollutant concentration expected as
the result of a component failure (empirical
values), and the monitoring mode partly
 required by law determine the type of
 diagnostics. A simple functional test
(black/white test) only checks system or com-
ponent operability (e.g. swirl flap opens and
closes). The extensive functional test provides
more detailed information about system op-
erability. As a result, the limits of adaption
must be monitored when monitoring adap-
tive fuel-injection functions (e.g. zero deliv-
ery calibration for a diesel engine, lambda
adaption for a gasoline engine). 

Diagnostic complexity has constantly
 increased as emission-control legislation 
has evolved. 

Switchon conditions
Diagnostic capabilities only run if the
switchon conditions are satisfied. 
This  includes, for instance: 
(cid:1) Torque thresholds
(cid:1) Engine-temperature thresholds
(cid:1) Engine-speed thresholds or limits

Inhibit conditions
Diagnostic capabilities and engine functions
cannot always operate simultaneously. 
There are inhibit conditions that prohibit 
the performance of certain functions. In the
diesel system, the Hot-Film Air-Mass Meter
(HFM) can only be monitored satisfactorily
when the exhaust-gas recirculation valve is
closed. For instance, tank ventilation (evapo-
rative-emissions control system) in a gasoline
system cannot function when catalytic-con-
verter diagnosis is in operation.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

303

Diagnostic Function SCHEDuler (DSCHED)
DSCHED is responsible for coordinating
 assigned engine capabilities (MF) and diag-
nostic capabilities (DF). It obtains informa-
tion from DVAL and DFPM to carry this out.
In addition, it reports functions that  require
release by DSCHED to perform their readi-
ness, after which the  current  system state is
checked.

Diagnosis VALidator (DVAL)
The DVAL (only installed in gasoline systems
to date) uses current fault-memory  entries
and additionally stored information to decide
for each detected fault whether it is the actual
cause, or a consequence of the fault. As a re-
sult, validation provides stored information
to the diagnostic tester for use in reading out
the fault memory.

In this way, diagnostic capabilities can 
be released in any sequence. All released
 diagnoses and their results are evaluated sub-
sequently.

Overview
Whereas EOBD only contains detailed moni-
toring specifications for individual compo-
nents, the requirements in CARB OBD II are
much more detailed. The list below shows 
the current state of CARB requirements 
for gasoline-engined and diesel-engined 
passenger cars. Requirements that are also 
described in detail in the EOBD legislation
are marked by (E):
(cid:1) Catalytic converter (E), heated catalytic

converter

(cid:1) Combustion (ignition) misfire

(E, for diesel system not for EOBD)

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

Catalytic converter diagnosis
In the diesel system, carbon monoxide (CO)
and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) are oxi-
dized in the oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter. Work is ongoing on diagnostic capa-
bilities for monitoring the operation of oxi-
dation-type catalytic converters relating to
temperature and differential pressure. One
approach focuses on active secondary injec-
tion (intrusive operation). Here, heat is gen-
erated in the oxidation-type catalytic con-
verter by an exothermic HC reaction. The
temperature is measured and compared with
calculated model values. These are used to 
derive the functionality of the  catalytic con-
verter.

Equally, work is ongoing on monitoring
functions for the storage and regeneration ca-
pabilities of NOx accumulator-type catalytic
converters that will also be installed in the
diesel system in future. The monitoring func-
tions run based on loading and regeneration
models, and the measured regeneration dura-
tion. This requires the use of lambda or NOx
sensors.

Combustion-miss detection
Incorrect fuel injection or loss of compres-
sion result in impaired combustion, and thus
to changes in emission values. The misfire de-
tector evaluates the time expired (segment
time) from one combustion cycle to the next
for each cylinder. This time is derived from
the speed-sensor signal. A segment time that
is longer than for the other cylinders indicates
a misfire or loss of compression.

In the diesel system, diagnosis of combus-

tion misses is only required and performed
when the engine is at idle speed.

Fuel system diagnosis
In the common-rail system, a fuel-system di-
agnosis includes the electrical monitoring of
injectors and rail-pressure control (high-pres-
sure control). In the Unit Injector System, it
also includes monitoring of the injector
switching time. Special functions of the fuel-
injection system that increase injected-fuel-
quantity precision are also monitored. 

Examples of this include zero-fuel-quantity
calibration, quantity-mean-value adaptation,
and the AS MOD observer function (air-sys-
tem model observer). The two last functions
use information from the lambda oxygen sen-
sor as input signals. From the models, they
calculate fluctuations between setpoint and
actual quantities.

Lambda-oxygen-sensor diagnosis
Modern diesel systems are fitted with broad-
band oxygen sensors. They require a different
diagnostic procedure than two-stage sensors
since their settings may deviate from λ = 1.
They are monitored electrically (short-circuit,
line interruption) and for plausibility. The
heater element of the sensor heater is tested
electrically and for permanent governor 
deviation.

Exhaust-gas recirculation system diagnosis
In the exhaust-gas recirculation system, the
EGR valve and – if fitted – the exhaust-gas
cooler are monitored. 

The exhaust-gas recirculation valve is mon-

itored for its electrical and functional oper-
ability. Functional monitoring is performed
by air-mass regulators and position con-
trollers. They check for permanent control
variances.

If the exhaust-gas recirculation system 
has a cooler fitted, its function must also be
monitored, i.e. an additional temperature
measurement takes place downstream of the
cooler. The temperature measured is com-
pared with a setpoint value calculated from 
a model. If a fault occurs, it is detected by
measuring the deviation between setpoint
and actual values.

Crankcase ventilation diagnosis
Faults in crankcase ventilation are detected by
the air-mass sensor, depending on the system.
The legislation requires no monitoring if the
crankcase ventilation has a “rugged” design.

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for passenger cars and light-duty trucks

305

Engine cooling system diagnosis 
The cooling system comprises a thermostat
and a coolant-termperature sensor. If the
thermostat is defective, for instance, the en-
gine temperature can only rise slowly and,
consequently, the exhaust emission rates may
increase. The diagnostic function for the ther-
mostat uses the coolant-termperature sensor
to check that a nominal temperature has been
reached. A temperature model is also used for
monitoring.

The coolant-termperature sensor is moni-
tored to ensure that a minimum temperature
has been reached in addition to monitoring
for electrical faults by means of a  dynamic
plausibility function. Dynamic plausibility is
performed as the engine cools down. These
functions can monitor the sensor for “stick-
ing” in both low and high temperature
ranges. 

Air-conditioner diagnosis
The engine can be operated at a different 
operating point in order to cover the air-
conditioner’s electrical load requirements.
The required diagnosis must therefore
 monitor all electronic components in the 
air conditioner that may cause an increase 
in emissions if they malfunction.

Particulate-filter diagnosis
The particulate filter is currently monitored
for filter breakage, removal, or blockage. 
A differential-pressure sensor is used to 
measure differential pressure (exhaust-gas
backpressure downstream and upstream 
of the filter) at a specific volumetric flow. 
The measured value can be used to decide
whether the filter is defective.

Comprehensive components
On-board diagnosis legislation requires that
all sensors (e.g. air-mass meter, wheel-speed
sensors, temperature sensors) and actuators
(e.g. throttle valve, high-pressure pump, glow
plugs) must be monitored if they either have
an impact on emissions, or are used to moni-
tor other components or systems (and conse-
quently, may block other diagnoses).

Sensors monitor the following faults (Fig. 5):
(cid:1) Electrical faults, i.e. short-circuits and line

breaks (signal-range check).

(cid:1) Range faults (out-of-range check), i.e. un-
dercutting or exceeding voltage limits de-
fined by the physical measurement range of
a sensor.

(cid:1) Plausibility faults (rationality check); these
are faults that are inherent in the compo-
nents themselves (e.g. drift), or which may
be caused by shunts, for instance. Monitor-
ing is carried out by a plausibility check on
the sensor signals, either by using a model,
or directly using other sensors.

Actuators must be monitored for electrical
faults and – if technically possible – also for
function. Functional monitoring means that,
when a control command (setpoint value) is
given, it is monitored by observing or mea-
suring (e.g. by a position sensor) the system
reaction (actual value) in a suitable way by
using information from the system. 

Besides all output stages, the following

 actuators are monitored:
(cid:1) throttle valve 
(cid:1) exhaust-gas recirculation valve
(cid:1) variable turbine geometry of the 

exhaust-gas turbocharger

(cid:1) swirl flap
(cid:1) glow plugs

Fault diagnostics

On-board diagnosis system for heavy-duty trucks

On-board diagnosis system
for heavy-duty trucks 

In Europe and the U.S.A., there exist draft
laws that have not yet been adopted; they are
based closely on legislation for passenger cars.

Legislation
In the EU, there are plans to introduce new
type approvals in October 2005 (coinciding
with Euro 4 emission-control legislation).
With effect from October 2006 an OBD sys-
tem will become obligatory for every com-
mercial vehicle. In the U.S.A., the draft of the
Californian CARB provides for the introduc-
tion of an OBD system for Model Year (MY)
2007. It is probable that EPA (U.S. Federal)
will also follow with a draft in 2004 for subse-
quent introduction in MY 2007. Besides that,
there are initiatives to promote worldwide
harmonization (World Wide Harmonized
(WWH) OBD). However, this is not expected
until 2012. Japan is planning to introduce an
OBD system in 2005. 

EOBD for trucks and buses > 3.5 t
European OBD legislation provides for 
a two-stage introduction. Stage 1 (2005)
 requires monitoring:
(cid:1) of the fuel-injection system for closed 

electrical circuit and total failure.

(cid:1) of emission-related engine components 
or systems for compliance with OBD 
emission limits (Table 1).

(cid:1) of the exhaust-gas treatment system for
major functional faults (e.g. damaged
 catalytic converter, urea deficit in the
SCR system).

Stage 2 (2008) requires:
(cid:1) Monitoring of the exhaust-gas treatment

system for emission limits. 

(cid:1) The OBD emission limits must be adapted
to the prevailing state of the art (availabil-
ity of exhaust-gas sensors).

Protocols for scan-tool communication 
over CAN have been approved using either
ISO 15 765 or SAE J1939. 

CARB OBD for HD trucks > 14,000 lb.
(6.35 t)
The present draft law is very close to passen-
ger-car legislation in its function require-
ments, and also provides for a two-stage
 introduction:
(cid:1) MY 2007: Monitoring for functional faults.
(cid:1) MY 2010: Monitoring for OBD emission

limits (Table 1).

The main changes compared with present
passenger-car legislation are as follows:
(cid:1) Erasing the OBD fault memory by scan

tool is no longer possible. This is only pos-
sible by self-healing (e.g. after repair).

(cid:1) SAE J1939 has also been approved as an al-
ternative to CAN diagnostic communica-
tion to ISO 15 765 (as for passenger cars).

“Once you have driven an automobile, you
will soon realize that there is something
unbelievably tiresome about horses (. . .).
But you do require a conscientious me-
chanic for the automobile (. . .)”.

Robert Bosch wrote these words to his
friend Paul Reusch in 1906. In those days, it
was indeed the case that breakdowns could
be repaired on the road or at home by an em-
ployed chauffeur or mechanic. However, with
the growing number of motorists driving their
own cars after the First World War, the need
for workshops offering repair services in-

1

creased rapidly. In the 1920s Robert Bosch
started to systematically create a nationwide
customer-service organization. In 1926 all the
repair centers were uniformly named “Bosch
Service” and the name was registered as a
trademark.

Today’s Bosch Service agencies retain the
same name. They are equipped with the latest
electronic equipment in order to meet the de-
mands of 21st-century automotive technology
and the quality expectations of the customers.

Workshop business

Service technology

More than 30,000 garages/workshops around
the world are equipped with workshop tech-
nology, i.e., test technology and workshop
software from Bosch. Workshop technology
is becoming increasingly important as it pro-
vides guidance and assistance in all matters
relating to diagnosis and  troubleshooting.

Workshop business

Trends
Many factors influence workshop business.
Current trends are, for example:
(cid:0) The proportion of diesel passenger cars is

rising

(cid:0) Longer service intervals and longer service
lives of automotive parts mean that vehi-
cles are being checked into workshops less
frequently

(cid:0) Workshop capacity utilization in the over-
all market will continue to decline in the
next few years

Diagnosis on a vehicle with a diagnosis tester 

(cid:0) The amount of electronic components in

vehicles is increasing – vehicles are becom-
ing “mobile computers”

(cid:0) Internetworking of electronic systems is in-
creasing, diagnostic and repair work covers
systems which are installed and networked
in the entire vehicle

(cid:0) Only the use of the latest test technology,
computers and diagnostic software will
safeguard business in the future

Consequences
Requirements
Workshops must adapt to the trends in order
to be able to offer their services successfully
on the market in the future. The conse-
quences can be derived directly from the
trends:
(cid:0) Professional fault diagnosis is the key to

professional repairs

(cid:0) Technical information is becoming the 
crucial requirement for vehicle repairs

(cid:0) Rapid availability of comprehensive techni-
cal information safeguards profitability

(cid:0) The need for workshop personnel to be
properly qualified is increasing dramati-

(cid:0) Investment by workshops in diagnosis,

 essential

Measurement and test technology
The crucial step for workshops to take is to
invest in the right test technology, diagnostic
software, technical information, and technical
training in order to receive the best possible
support and assistance for all the jobs and
tasks in the workshop process.

Workshop processes
The essential tasks which come up in the
workshop can be portrayed in processes. Two
distinct subprocesses are used for hand ling all
tasks in the service and repair fields. The first
subprocess covers the predominantly opera-
tions- and organizaton-based activity of job-
order acceptance, while the second subprocess
covers the predominantly technically based
work steps of service and repair implementa-
tion. 

Job-order acceptance
When a vehicle arrives in the workshop, the
job-order acceptance system’s database fur-
nishes immediate access to all available infor-
mation on the vehicle. The moment the vehi-
cle enters the shop, the system offers access to
the vehicle’s entire service history,  including
all service and repairs that it has received in
the past. Furthermore, this sequence involves
the completion of all tasks relating to the cus-
tomer’s request, its basic feasibility, scheduling
of completion dates, provision of resources,
parts and working materials and equipment,
and an initial examination of the task and 
extent of work involved. Depending on the
process objective, all subfunctions of the
ESI[tronic] product are used within the
framework of the service acceptance process.

Service and repair implementation
Here, the jobs defined within the framework
of the job-order acceptance are carried out. 
If it is not possible to complete the task in a
single process cycle, appropriate repeat loops
must be provided until the process result
which is aimed for is achieved. Depending 
on the process objective, all subfunctions 
of the ESI[tronic] product are used within
the framework of the service and repair
 implementation process.

Electronic Service Information
(ESI[tronic])
System functions for supporting the
 workshop process
ESI[tronic] is a modular software product for
the automotive-engineering trade. The indi-
vidual modules contain the following infor-
mation:
(cid:0) Technical information on spare parts and

automotive equipment

(cid:0) Exploded views and parts lists for spare

parts and assemblies

(cid:0) Technical data and setting values
(cid:0) Flat rate units and times for work on the

(cid:0) Vehicle diagnosis and vehicle-system diag-

vehicle

nosis

(cid:0) Troubleshooting instructions for different

vehicle systems

(cid:0) Repair instructions for vehicle compo-

nents, e.g., diesel power units

(cid:0) Electronic circuit diagrams
(cid:0) Maintenance schedules and diagrams
(cid:0) Test and setting values for assemblies
(cid:0) Data for costing maintenance, repair and

service work

Application
The chief users of ESI[tronic] are motor
garages/workshops, assembly repairers 
and the automotive-parts wholesale trade.
They use the technical information for the
following purposes:
(cid:0) Motor garages/workshops: mainly for
 diagnosis, service and repair of vehicle 
systems

3

ESI[tronic] workshop software for all vehicle 
marques

(cid:0) Assembly repairers: mainly for testing,
 adjusting and repair of assemblies

(cid:0) Automotive-parts wholesale trade: mainly

for parts information

Garages/workshops and assembly repairers
use this parts information in addition to
 diagnosis, repair and service information.
Product interfaces enable ESI[tronic] to net-
work with other (particularly commercial)
software in the workshop environment and
the automotive-parts wholesale trade in order,
for instance, to exchange data with the ac-
counting merchandise information system.

Benefit to the user of ESI[tronic]
The benefit of using ESI[tronic] lies in the
fact that the system furnishes a large amount
of information which is needed to conduct
and safeguard the business of motor garages/
workshops. This is made possible by the
broadly conceived and modular ESI[tronic]
product program. The information is offered
on one interface with a standardized system
for all vehicle marques.

Comprehensive vehicle coverage is important
for workshop business in that the necessary
information is always to hand. This is guaran-
teed by ESI[tronic] because country-specific
vehicle databases and information on new 
vehicles are incorporated in the product plan-
ning. Regular updating of the software offers
the best opportunity of keeping abreast of
technical developments in the automotive 
industry.

Vehicle system analysis (FSA)
Vehicle system analysis (FSA) from Bosch 
offers a simple solution to complex vehicle 
diagnosis. The causes of a problem can be
swiftly located thanks to diagnosis interfaces
and fault memories in the on-board electron-
ics of modern motor vehicles. The component
checking facility of FSA developed by Bosch 
is very useful in swiftly locating a fault: The
FSA measurement technology and display
can be adjusted to the relevant component.

The diagnosis tester provides the data needed
for direct comparisons of specified results
and current readings, without the need for
supplementary entries. ESI[tronic] uses the
results of the diagnosis as the basis for gener-
ating specific repair instructions. The system
also provides displays with other informa-
tion, such as component locations, exploded
views of assemblies, diagrams showing the
layouts of electrical, pneumatic and hydraulic
systems, etc. Working at the PC, users can
then proceed directly from the exploded
views to the parts lists with part numbers to
order the required replacement components.
All service procedures and replacement com-
ponents are recorded to support the billing
process. After the final road test, the bill is
produced simply by pressing a few keys. The
system also provides a clear and concise
printout with the results of the vehicle diag-
nosis. This offers the customer a full report
detailing all of the service operations and ma-
terials that went into the vehicle’s repair.

This enables this component to be tested
while it is still installed.

Measuring equipment
Workshop personnel can choose from various
options for diagnosis and troubleshooting:
the high-performance, portable KTS 650 sys-
tem tester or the workshop-compatible
KTS 520 and KTS 550 KTS modules in con-
junction with a standard PC or laptop. The
modules have an integrated multimeter, and
KTS 550 and KTS 650 also have a 2-channel
oscilloscope. For work applications on the 
vehicle, ESI[tronic] is installed in the KTS 650
or on a PC.

Example of the sequence in 
the workshop
The ESI[tronic] software package supports
workshop personnel throughout the entire
vehicle repair process A diagnosis interface 
allows ESI[tronic] to communicate with the
electronic systems within the vehicle, such as
the engine control unit. Working at the PC,
the user starts by selecting the SIS (Service
Information System) utility to initiate diag-
nosis of on-board control units and access the
engine control unit’s fault storage.

Support is provided by Electronic Service In-
formation (ESI[tronic]). It contains instruc-
tions for further fault-finding for many 
possible problems (e.g. engine bucks) and
faults (e.g. short-circuit in engine-tempera-
ture sensor). 

Guided fault-finding
The main element is the guided fault-finding
procedure. The workshop employee is guided
by means of a symptom-dependent, event-
controlled procedure – starting from the
symptom (vehicle symptom or fault-memory
entry). Onboard (fault-memory entry) and

offboard facilities (actuator diagnosis and

Guided fault-finding, fault-memory read-

outs, workshop diagnostic functions, and
electrical communication with offboard
testers take place using PC-based diagnostic
testers. This may be a specific workshop tester
from the vehicle manufacturer or a universal
tester (e.g. KTS 650 by Bosch). 

Reading out fault-memory entries
Fault information (fault-memory entries)
stored during vehicle operation are read out
via a serial interface during vehicle service or
repair in the customer-service workshop.

Fault entries are read out using a diagnostic
tester. The workshop employee receives infor-
mation about:
(cid:1) Malfunctions (e.g. engine-temperature sen-

sor)

(cid:1) Fault codes (e.g. short-circuit to ground,

implausible signal, static fault)

(cid:1) Ambient conditions (measured values 

on fault storage, e.g. engine speed, engine
temperature, etc.).

Once the fault information has been retrieved
in the workshop and the fault corrected, the
fault memory can be cleared again using the
tester. 

A suitable interface must be defined for com-
munication between the control unit and the
tester.

Actuator diagnostics
The control unit contains an actuator diag-
nostic routine in order to activate individual
actuators at the customer-service workshop
and test their functionality. This test mode is
started using the diagnostic tester and only
functions when the vehicle is at standstill be-
low a specific engine speed, or when the en-
gine is switched off. This allows an acoustic
(e.g. valve clicking), visual (e.g. flap move-
ment), or other type of inspection, e.g. mea-
surement of electric signals, to test actuator
function.

Fig. 1

The CAS[plus] system
(Computer Aided
 Service) combines
 control-unit diagnosis
with SIS fault-finding
 instructions for even
more efficient fault-
 finding. The decisive
 values for diagnostics
and repair then appear
immediately on screen.

Workshop diagnostic functions
Faults that the on-board diagnosis fails to de-
tect can be localized using support functions.
These diagnostic functions are implemented
in the engine control unit and are controlled
by the diagnostic tester.

Workshop diagnostic functions run auto-
matically, either after they are started by the
diagnostic tester, or they report back to the
diagnostic tester at the end of the test, or the
diagnostic tester assumes runtime control,
measured data acquisition, and data evalua-
tion. The control unit then implements indi-
vidual commands only.

Example
During a compression test, the fuel-injection
system is switched off while the engine is
turned by the starter motor. The engine ECU
records the crankshaft speed pattern. The
compression in each of the cylinders can be
deduced from speed fluctuations, i.e. the dif-
ference between the lowest and highest revo-
lutions, thus giving an indication of engine
condition

Offboard tester
The diagnostic capabilities are expanded by
using additional sensors, test equipment, and
external evaluators. In the event of a fault de-
tected in the workshop, offboard testers are
adapted to the vehicle.

Testing equipment

Effective testing of the system requires the use
of special testing equipment. While earlier
electronic systems could be tested with basic
equipment such as a multimeter, ongoing 
advances have resulted in electronic systems
that can only be diagnosed with complex
testers.

The system testers in the KTS series are
widely used by vehicle repairers. The KTS 650
(Fig. 1) offers a wide range of  capabilities 
for use in the vehicle repairs, enhanced in
particular by its graphical display of data such
as test results. These system testers are also
known as diagnosis testers.

Functions of the KTS 650
The KTS 650 offers a wide variety of func-
tions which are selected by means of buttons
and menus on the large display screen. The
list below details the most important func-
tions offered by the KTS 650.

Identification
The system automatically detects the con-
nected ECU and reads actual values, fault
memories and ECU-specific data.

Reading/erasing the fault memory
The fault information detected during  vehicle
operation by on-board diagnosis and stored
in the fault memory can be read with the
KTS 650 and displayed on screen in plain 
text.

Reading actual values
Current values which the engine control unit
calculates can be read out as physical quanti-
ties (e.g, engine speed in rpm).

Actuator diagnostics
The electrical actuators (e.g., valves, relays)
can be specifically triggered for function-
testing purposes.

Engine test
The system tester initiates programmed test
sequences in the engine control unit for
checking the engine-management system 
or the engine (e.g., compression test).

Multimeter function
Electrical current, voltage and resistance can
be tested in the same way as with a conven-
tional multimeter.

Time graph display
The recorded measured values can be shown
in graphic displays as signal curve similar to
those available from an oscilloscope (e.g.,
Lambda-sensor voltage, signal voltage of 
hot-film air-mass sensor).

Additional information
Specific additional information relevant to
the faults/components displayed can also be
shown in conjunction with the Electronic
Service Information (ESI[tronic]) (e.g., 
troubleshooting instructions, location of
components in the engine compartment, test
specifications, electrical circuit diagrams).

Printout
All data (e.g., list of actual values or docu-
ment for the customer) can be printed out 
on standard PC printers.

Programming
The software of the engine control unit can
be coded with the KTS 650 (e.g., automatic 
or manual transmission).

The extent to which the capabilities of the
KTS 650 can be utilized in the workshop
 depends on the system to be tested. Not all
ECUs support its full range of functions.

Fuel-injection pump test benches

Fuel-injection pump 
test benches

Accurately tested and precisely adjusted
fuel-injection pumps and governor mecha-
nisms are key components for obtaining
 optimized performance and fuel economy
from diesel engines. They are also crucial in
ensuring compliance with increasingly strict
exhaust-gas emission regulations. The fuel-
injection pump test bench (Fig. 1) is a vital
tool for meeting these requirements. 

The main specifications governing both test
bench and test procedures are defined by ISO
standards; particularly demanding are the
specifications for rigidity and geometrical
consistency in the drive unit (5). 

As time progresses, so do the levels of
peak pressure that fuel-injection pumps are
expected to generate. This development is
reflected in higher performance demands
and power requirements for pump test
benches. Powerful electric drive units, a large
flyweight and precise control of rotational
speed guarantee stability at all engine speeds.
This stability is an essential requirement for

repeatable, mutually comparable measure-
ments and test results.

Flow measurement methods
An important test procedure is to measure
the fuel pumped each time the plunger
moves through its stroke. For this test, the
fuel-injection pump is clamped on the test
bench support (1), with its drive side con-
nected to the test bench drive coupling. Test-
ing proceeds with a standardized calibrating
oil at a precisely monitored and controlled
temperature. A special, precision-calibrated
nozzle-and-holder assembly (3) is connected
to each pump barrel. This strategy ensures
mutually comparable measurements for each
test. Two test methods are available.

Glass gauge method (MGT)
The test bench features an assembly with
two glass gauges (Fig. 2, 5). A range of gages
with various capacities are available for each
cylinder. This layout can be used to test 
fuel-injection pumps for engines of up 
to 12 cylinders.

In the first stage, the discharged calibrating
flows past the glass gages to return directly to
the oil tank. As soon as the fuel-injection
pump reaches the rotational speed indicated
in the test specifications, a slide valve opens,
allowing the calibrating oil from the fuel-in-
jection pump to flow to the glass gages. Sup ply
to the glass containers is then interrupted
when the pump has executed the preset num-
ber of strokes. 

The fuel quantity delivered to each cylinder
in cm3 can now be read from each of the glass
gages. The standard test period is 1,000 strokes,
making it easy to interpret the numerical re-
sult in mm3 per stroke of delivered fuel. The
test results are compared with the setpoint
values and entered in the test record.

Electronic flow measurement system (KMA)
This system replaces the glass gauges with a
control, display and processor unit (Fig. 1, 6).
While this unit is usually mounted on the test
bench, it can also be installed on a cart next to
the test bench. 

This test relies on continuous measuring the

delivery capacity (Fig. 3). A control plunger
(6) is installed in parallel with the  input and
output sides of a gear pump (2). When the
pump’s delivery quantity equals the quantity of
calibrating oil emerging from the test nozzle
(10), the plunger remains in its center posi-

tion. If the flow of calibrating oil is greater, the
plunger moves to the left – if the flow of cali-
brating oil is lower, the plunger moves to the
right. This plunger motion controls the
amount of light traveling from an LED (3) to a
photocell (4). The electronic control circuitry
(7)recordsthisdeviationandresponds by vary-
ing the pump’s rotational speed until its deliv-
ery rate again corresponds to the quantity of
fluid emerging from the test nozzle. The control
plunger then returns to its center position. 
The pump speed can be varied to measure 
delivery quantity with extreme precision.

Two of these measurement cells are present
on the test bench. The computer connects all
of the test cylinders to the two measurement
cells in groups of two, proceeding sequentially
from one group to the next (multiplex opera-
tion). The main features of this test method
are: 
(cid:0) Highly precise and reproducible test results
(cid:0) Clear test results with digital display and
graphic presentation in the form of bar
graphs

(cid:0) Test record for documentation
(cid:0) Supports adjustments to compensate for
variations in cooling and/or temperature

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

Testing in-line fuel-injection
pumps

The test program for fuel-injection pumps
involves operations that are carried out with
the pump fitted to the engine in the vehicle
(system fault diagnosis) as well as those per-
formed on the pump in isolation on a test
bench or in the workshop. This latter cate-
gory involves
(cid:0) Testing the fuel-injection pump on the

pump test bench and making any necessary
adjustments

(cid:0) Repairing the fuel-injection pump/gover-

nor and subsequently resetting them on the
pump test bench

In the case of in-line fuel-injection pumps, a
distinction has to be made between those with
mechanical governors and those which are
electronically controlled. In either case, the
pump and its governor/control system are
tested in combination, as both components
must be matched to each other.

The large number and variety of in-line
fuel-injection pump designs necessitates vari-
ations in the procedures for testing and ad-
justment. The examples given below can,
therefore, only provide an idea of the full 
extent of workshop technology.

Adjustments made on the test bench
The adjustments made on the test bench
comprise
(cid:0) Start of delivery and cam offset for each 

individual pump unit

(cid:0) Delivery quantity setting and equalization

between pump units

(cid:0) Adjustment of the governor mounted on

the pump

(cid:0) Harmonization of pump and governor/

control system (overall system adjustment)

For every different pump type and size, sepa-
rate testing and repair instructions and speci-
fications are provided which are specifically
prepared for use with Bosch pump test
benches.

The pump and governor are connected to the
engine lube-oil circuit. The oil inlet connec-
tion is on the fuel-injection pump’s camshaft
housing or the pump housing. 
For each testing sequence on the test bench,
the fuel-injection pump and governor must
be topped up with lube oil. 

Testing delivery quantity
The fuel-injection pump test bench can mea-
sure the delivery quantity for each individual
cylinder (using a calibrated tube apparatus or
computer operating and display terminal, see
“Fuel-injection pump test benches”). The in-
dividual delivery quantity figures obtained
over a range of different settings must be
within defined tolerance limits. Excessive di-
vergence of individual delivery quantity fig-
ures would result in uneven running of the
engine. If any of the delivery quantity figures
are outside the specified tolerances, the pump
barrel(s) concerned must be readjusted.
There are different procedures for this de-
pending on the pump model.

Governor/control system adjustment
Governor
Testing of mechanical governors involves an
extensive range of adjustments. A dial gauge
is used to check the control-rack travel at de-
fined speeds and control-lever positions on
the fuel-injection pump test bench. The test
results must match the specified figures. If
there are excessive discrepancies, the governor
characteristics must be reset. There are a
number of ways of doing this, such as chang-
ing the spring characteristics by altering
spring tension, or by fitting new springs. 

Electronic control system
If the fuel-injection pump is electronically
controlled, it has an electromechanical actua-
tor that is operated by an electronic control
unit instead of a directly mounted governor.
That actuator moves the control rack and
thus controls the injected fuel quantity. Oth-
erwise, there is no difference in the mechani-
cal operation of the fuel-injection pump.

Service technologyy

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

During the tests, the control rack is held at a
specific position. The control-rack travel must
be calibrated to match the voltage signal of
the rack-travel sensor. This done by adjusting
the rack-travel sensor until its signal voltage
matches the specified signal level for the set
control-rack travel.

In the case of control-sleeve in-line fuel-in-
jection pumps, the start-of-delivery solenoid
is not connected for this test in order to be
able to obtain a defined start of delivery.

Adjustments with the pump in situ
The pump’s start of delivery setting has a ma-
jor influence on the engine’s performance
and exhaust-gas emission characteristics. The
start of delivery is set, firstly, by correct ad-
justment of the pump itself, and secondly, 
by correct synchronization of the pump’s
camshaft with the engine’s timing system. For
this reason, correct mounting of the injection
pump on the engine is extremely im portant.
The start of delivery must therefore be tested
with the pump mounted on the engine in 
order to ensure that it is correctly fitted. 

There are a number of different ways in
which this can be done depending on the
pump model. The description that follows is
for a Type RSF governor.

On the governor’s flyweight mount, there 

is a tooth-shaped timing mark (Fig. 1). 
In the governor housing, there is a threaded
socket which is normally closed off by a screw
cap. When the piston that is used for calibra-
tion (usually no. 1 cylinder) is in the start-of-
delivery position, the timing mark is exactly
in line with the center of the threaded socket.
This “spy hole” in the governor housing is part
of a sliding flange.

Fitting the fuel-injection pump
Locking the camshaft
The fuel-injection pump leaves the factory
with its camshaft locked (Fig. 1a) and is
mounted on the engine when the engine’s
crankshaft is set at a defined position. The
pump lock is then removed. This tried and
tested method is economical and is adopted
increasingly widely.

Start-of-delivery timing mark
Synchronizing the fuel-injection pump with
the engine is performed with the aid of the
start-of-delivery timing marks, which have to
be brought into alignment. Those marks are
to be found on the engine as well as on the
fuel-injection pump (Fig. 2 overleaf). There
are several methods of determining the start of
delivery depending on the pump type.

Normally, the adjustments are based on the
engine’s compression stroke for cylinder no. 1
but other methods may be adopted for rea-
sons related to specific engine designs. The
engine manufacturer’s instructions must
therefore always be observed. On most diesel
engines, the start-of-delivery timing mark is
on the flywheel, the crankshaft pulley or the
vibration damper. The vibration damper is
generally mounted on the crankshaft in the
position normally occupied by the V-belt pul-
ley, and the pulley then bolted to the vibra-
tion damper. The complete assembly then
looks rather like a thick V-belt pulley with a
small flywheel.

Testing in-line fuel-injection pumps

Checking static start of delivery
Checking with indicator-lamp sensor
The tooth-shaped timing mark can be located
with the aid of an optical sensor, the indica-
tor-lamp sensor (Fig. 1b), which is screwed
into the socket in governor housing. When it
is opposite the sensor, the two indicator lamps
on the sensor light up. The start of delivery 
in degrees of crankshaft rotation can then 
be read off from the flywheel timing marks,
for example.

High-pressure overflow method
The start-of-delivery tester is connected to
the pressure outlet of the relevant pump barrel
(Fig. 3). The other pressure outlets are closed off.
The pressurized fuel flows through the open
inlet passage of the pump barrel and exits,
initially as a jet, into the observation vessel
(3). As the engine crankshaft rotates, the
pump plunger moves towards its top dead
center position. When it reaches the start-of-
delivery position, the pump plunger closes off
the barrel’s inlet passage. The injection jet 
entering the observation vessel thus dwindles
and the fuel flow is reduced to a drip. The
start of delivery in degrees of crank shaft ro-
tation is read off from the timing marks.

Checking dynamic start of delivery
Checking with inductive sensor
An inductive sensor that is screwed into 
the socket in the governor housing (Fig. 1c)
supplies an electrical signal every time the
governor timing mark passes when the engine
is running. A second inductive sensor sup-
plies a signal when the engine is at top dead
center (Fig. 4). The engine analyzer, to which
the two inductive sensors are connected, uses
those signals to calculate the start of delivery
and the engine speed.

Checking with a piezoelectric sensor and 
a stroboscopic timing light
A piezoelectric sensor is fixed to the high-pres-
sure delivery line for the cylinder on which
adjustment is to be based. As soon as the fuel-
injection pump delivers fuel to that cylinder,
the high-pressure delivery line expands slightly
and the piezoelectric sensor transmits an elec-
trical signal. This signal is received by an engine
analyzer which uses it to control the flashing of a
stroboscopic timing light. The timing light is
pointed at the timing marks on the engine.
When illuminated by the flashing timing light,
the flywheel timing marks appear to be station -
ary. The angular value in degrees of crankshaft
rotation can then be read off for start of delivery.

and governors with separate oil systems have
their own dipsticks for checking the oil level.

n

Venting
Air bubbles in the fuel impair the proper op-
eration of the fuel-injection pump or disable
it entirely. Therefore, if the system has been
temporarily out of use it should be carefully
vented before being operated again. There is
generally a vent screw on the fuel-injection
pump overflow or the fuel filter for this pur-
pose.

Lubrication
Fuel-injection pumps and governors are nor-
mally connected to the engine lube-oil circuit
as the fuel-injection pump then requires no
maintenance.

Before being used for the first time, the
fuel-injection pump and the governor must
be filled with the same type of oil that is used
in the engine. In the case of fuel-injection
pumps that are not directly connected to the
engine lube-oil circuit, the pump is filled
through the filler cap after removing the vent
flap or filter. The oil level check takes place at
the same time as the regular engine oil changes
and is performed by removing the oil check
plug on the governor. Excess oil (from leak
fuel) is then drained off or the level topped
up if required. Whenever the fuel-injection
pump is removed or the engine overhauled,

Testing helix and port-controlled distributor injection pumps

Testing helix and port-
 controlled distributor  injection
pumps
Good engine performance, high fuel econ-
omy and low emissions depend on correct
adjustment of the helix and port-controlled
distributor injection pump. This is why com-
pliance with official specifications is ab-
solutely essential during testing and adjust-
ment operations on fuel-injection pumps.

One important parameter is the start of de-

livery (in service bay), which is checked with
the pump installed. Other tests are conducted
on the test bench (in test area). In this case,
the pump must be removed from the vehicle
and mounted on the test bench. Before the
pump is removed, the engine crankshaft
should be rotated until the reference cylinder
is at TDC. The reference cylinder is usually
cylinder No. 1. This step eases subsequent as-
sembly procedures.

Test bench measurements
The test procedures described here are suit-
able for use on helix and port-controlled ax-
ial-piston distributor pumps with electronic
and mechanical control, but not with sole-
noid-controlled distributor injection pumps.

Test bench operations fall into two categories:
(cid:0) Basic adjustment and
(cid:0) Testing

The results obtained from the pump test are
entered in the test record, which also lists all
the individual test procedures. This docu-
ment also lists all specified minimum and
maximum results. The test readings must 
lie within the range defined by these two
 extremes.

A number of supplementary, special-pur-
pose test steps are needed to assess all the dif-
ferent helix and port-controlled axial-piston
distributor pumps; detailed descriptions of
every contingency, however, extend  beyond
the bounds of this chapter.

Basic adjustments
The first step is to adjust the distributor injec-
tion pump to the correct basic settings. This
entails measuring the following parameters
under defined operating conditions.

LPC adjustment
This procedure assesses the distributor
plunger lift between Bottom Dead Center
(BDC) and the start of delivery. The pump
must be connected to the test-bench fuel sup-
ply line for this test. The technician unscrews
the 6-point bolt from the central plug fitting
and then installs a test assembly with drain
tube and gauge in its place (Fig. 1, 1). 

The gauge probe rests against the distribu-

tor plunger, allowing it to measure lift. Now
the technician turns the pump’s input shaft
(4) by hand until the needle on the gauge
stops moving. The control plunger is now at
Top Dead Center (TDC).

A supply pressure of roughly 0.5 bar
 propels the calibrating oil into the plunger
chamber behind the distributor plunger (5).
For this test, the solenoid-operated shutoff
valve (ELAB) (9) is kept energized to main-
tain it in its open position. The calibrating oil
thus flows from the plunger chamber to the
test assembly before emerging from the drain
hose.

Now the technician manually rotates the
input shaft in its normal direction of rota-
tion. The calibrating oil ceases to flow into
the plunger chamber once its inlet passage
closes. The oil remaining in the chamber con-
tinues to emerge from the drain hose. This
point in the distributor plunger’s travel marks
the start of delivery.

The lift travel between Bottom Dead Cen-
ter (BDC) and the start of delivery indicated
by the gauge can now be compared with the
setpoint value. If the reading is outside the
tolerance range, it will be necessary to dis-
mantle the pump and replace the cam mecha-
nism between cam disk and plunger. 

Supply-pump pressure
As it affects the timing device, the pressure 
of the supply pump (internal pressure) must
also be tested. For this procedure, the over-
flow restrictor (7) is unscrewed and an
adapter with a connection to the pressure
gauge (8) is installed. Now the overflow re-
strictor is installed in an adapter provided 
in the test assembly. This makes it possible to
test the pump’s internal chamber pressure 
upstream of the restrictor.

A plug pressed into the pressure-control
valve controls the tension on its spring to 
determine the pump’s internal pressure. 
Now the technician continues pressing the
plug into the valve until the pressure reading
corresponds to the setpoint value.

Timing device travel
The technician removes the cover from the
timing device to gain access for installing 
a travel tester with a vernier scale (3). This
scale makes it possible to record travel in 
the timing device as a function of rotational
speed; the results can then be compared with
the setpoint values. If the measured timing
device travel does not correspond with the
setpoint values, shims must be  installed un-
der the timing spring to correct its initial
spring tension.

Adjusting the basic delivery quantity
During this procedure the fuel-injection
pump’s delivery quantity is adjusted at a 
constant rotational speed for each of the
 following four conditions:
(cid:0) Idle (no-load)
(cid:0) Full-load
(cid:0) Full-load governor regulation and 
(cid:0) Starting 

Delivery quantities are monitored using the
MGT or KMA attachment on the fuel-injec-
tion pump test bench (refer to section on
“Fuel-injection pump test benches”). 

First, with the control lever’s full-load stop
adjusted to the correct position, the full-load
governor screw in the pump cover is adjusted
to obtain the correct full-load  delivery quan-

324

tity at a defined engine speed. Here, the gov-
ernor adjusting screw must be turned back 
to prevent the full-load stop from reducing
delivery quantity.

The next step is to measure the delivery
quantity with the control lever against the
idle-speed stop screw. The idle-speed stop
screw must be adjusted to ensure that the
monitored delivery quantity is as specified.
The governor screw is adjusted at high
 rotational speed. The measured delivery
quantity must correspond to the specified
full-load delivery quantity.

The governor test also allows verification of
the governor’s intervention speed. The gover-
nor should respond to the specified rpm
threshold by first reducing and then  finally in-
terrupting the fuel flow. The breakaway speed
is set using the governor speed screw.

There are no simple ways to adjust the
 delivery quantity for starting. The test condi-
tions are a rotational speed of 100 rpm and
the control lever against its full-load shutoff
stop. If the measured delivery quantity is be-
low a specified level, reliable starting cannot
be guaranteed. 

Testing
Once the basic adjustment settings have been
completed, the technician can proceed to 
assess the pump’s operation under various
conditions. As during the basic adjustment
procedure, testing focuses on
(cid:0) Supply-pump pressure
(cid:0) Timing device travel
(cid:0) Delivery quantity curve 

The pump operates under various specific
conditions for this test series, which also
 includes a supplementary procedure.

Overflow quantity
The vane-type supply pump delivers more
fuel than the nozzles can inject. The excess
calibrating oil must flow through the over-
flow restriction valve and back to the oil tank.
It is the volume of this return flow that is
measured in this procedure. A hose is con-
nected to the overflow restriction valve; 

depending on the selected test procedure. 
The other end is then placed in a glass gauge
in the MGT assembly, or installed on a special
connection on the KMA unit. The overflow
quantity from a 10-second test period is then
converted to a delivery quantity in liters per
hour.

If the test results fail to reach the setpoint
values, this indicates wear in the vane-type
supply pump, an incorrect overflow valve or
internal leakage.

Dynamic testing of start of delivery
A diesel engine tester (such as the Bosch
ETD 019.00) allows precise adjustment of the
distributor injection pump’s delivery timing
on the engine. This unit registers the start of
delivery along with the timing adjustments
that occur at various engine speeds with no
need to disconnect any  high-pressure delivery
lines. 

Testing with piezo-electric sensor and
 stroboscopic timing light
The piezo-electric sensor (Fig. 2, 4) is
clamped onto the high-pressure delivery 
line leading to the reference cylinder. Here, 
it is important to ensure that the sensor is
mounted on a straight and clean section of
tubing with no bends; the sensor should also
be positioned as close as possible to the fuel-
injection pump. 

The start of delivery triggers pulses in the
fuel-injection line. These generate an electric
signal in the piezo-electric sensor. The signal
controls the light pulses generated by the tim-
ing light (5). The timing light is now aimed at
the engine’s flywheel. Each time the pump
starts delivery to the reference cylinder, the
timing light flashes, lighting up the TDC
mark on the flywheel. This allows correlation
of timing to flywheel position. The flashes 
occur only when delivery to the reference
cylinder starts, producing a static image. The
degree markings (6) on the crankshaft or fly-
wheel show the crankshaft position relative to
the start of delivery. 

Engine speed is also indicated on the diesel

engine tester.

dead center position to the TDC mark on the
reference cylinder. It is vital to comply with
the precise specification figure for this travel
contained in the fuel-injection pump’s
datasheet. If the dial gauge reading is not
within the specification, it will be necessary 
to loosen the attachment bolt on the pump
flange, turn the pump housing and repeat the
test. It is important to ensure that the cold-
start accelerator is not active during this pro-
cedure.

Measuring the idle speed
The idle speed is monitored with the engine
heated to its normal operating temperature,
and in a no-load state, using the engine tester.
The idle speed can be adjusted using the idle-
speed stop screw.

Setting start of delivery
If the results of this start-of-delivery test
 deviate from the test specifications, it will 
be necessary to change the fuel-injection
pump’s angle relative to the engine.

The first step is to switch off the engine.
Then the technician rotates the crankshaft
until the reference cylinder’s piston is at the
point at which delivery should start. The
crankshaft features a reference mark for this
operation; the mark should be aligned with
the corresponding mark on the bellhousing.
The technician now unscrews the 6-point
screw from the central plug screw. As for ba-
sic adjustment process on the test bench, the
technician now installs a dial-gauge assembly
in the opening. This is used to observe dis-
tributor plunger travel while the crankshaft is
being turned. As the crankshaft is turned
counter to its normal direction of rotation
(or in the normal direction on some engines),
the plunger retracts in the pump. The techni-
cian should stop turning the crankshaft once
the needle on the gauge stops moving. The
plunger is now at bottom dead center. Now
the dial gauge is reset to zero. The crankshaft
is then rotated in its normal direction of rota-
tion as far as the TDC mark. The dial gauge
now indicates the travel executed by the dis-
tributor plunger on its way from its bottom

Nozzle tests

The nozzle-and-holder assembly consists of
the nozzle and the holder. The holder includes
all of the required filters, springs and connec-
tions.

The nozzle affects the diesel engine’s output,
fuel economy, exhaust-gas composition and
operating refinement. This is why the nozzle
test is so important.

An important tool for assessing nozzle per-

formance is the nozzle tester.

Nozzle tester
The nozzle tester is basically a manually oper-
ated fuel-injection pump (Fig. 1). For testing, a
high-pressure delivery line (4) is used to con-
nect the nozzle-and-holder assembly (3) to
the tester. The calibrating oil is contained in a
tank (5). The required pressure is generated
using the hand lever (8). The pressure gage
(6) indicates the pressure of the calibrating
oil; a valve (7) can be used to disconnect it
from the high-pressure circuit for specific test
procedures.

The EPS100 (0684200704) nozzle tester is
specified for testing nozzles of Sizes P, R, S
and T. It conforms to the standards defined in
ISO 8984. The prescribed calibrating oil is de-
fined in ISO standard 4113. A calibration case
containing all the components is required to
calibrate inspect the nozzle tester.

This equipment provides the basic condi-
tions for reproducible, mutually compatible
test results.

Test methods
Ultrasonic cleaning is recommended for the
complete nozzle-and-holder assemblies once
they have been removed from the engine.
Cleaning is mandatory on nozzles when they
are submitted for warranty claims. 

Important: Nozzles are high-precision com-

ponents. Careful attention to cleanliness is 
vital for ensuring correct operation.

The next step is to inspect the assembly to
determine whether any parts of the nozzle or
holder show signs of mechanical or thermal
wear. If signs or wear are present, it will be
necessary to replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-
holder assembly.

The assessment of the nozzle’s condition pro-
ceeds in four test steps, with some variation
depending on whether the nozzles are pintle 
or hole-type units.

Chatter test
The chatter test provides information on the
smoothness of action of the needle. During
injection, the needle oscillates back and forth
to generate a typical chatter. This motion en-
sures efficient dispersion of the fuel particles. 
The pressure gage should be disconnected

for this test (close valve).

Pintle nozzle
The lever on the nozzle tester is operated at a
rate of one to two strokes per second. The pres-
sure of the calibrating oil rises, ultimately
climbing beyond the nozzle’s opening pres-
sure. During the subsequent discharge, the
nozzle should produce an audible chatter; 
if it fails to do so, it should be replaced.

The pressure gage must be switched back on
for this test (valve open).

Pintle nozzle and hole-type nozzle 
with single-spring nozzle holder
The operator slowly presses the lever down-
ward, continuing until the gage needle indi-
cates the highest available pressure. At this
point, the valve opens and the nozzle starts 
to discharge fuel. Pressure specifications can
be found in the “nozzles and nozzle-holder
components” catalog.

Opening pressures can be corrected by re-
placing the adjustment shim installed against
the compression spring in the nozzle holder.
This entails extracting the nozzle from the
nozzle holder. If the opening pressure is too
low, a thicker shim should be installed; the 
response to excessive opening pressures is 
to install a thinner shim.

Hole-type nozzle with two-spring nozzle holder
This test method can only be used to deter-
mine the initial opening pressure on two-
spring nozzle-and-holder assemblies.

The is no provision for shim replacement
on some nozzle-and-holder assemblies. The
only available response with these units is to
replace the entire assembly.

Leak test
The pressure is set to 20 bar above the open-
ing pressure. After 10 seconds, formation of 
a droplet at the injection orifice is acceptable,
provided that the droplet does not fall. 

The prescribed response to an unsuccessful
leak test is to replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-
holder assembly.

When installing a new nozzle in its holder, 
always observe the official torque specifica-
tions, even on hole-type nozzles.

Hole-type nozzle
The hand lever is pumped at high speed. This
produces a hum or whistling sound, depend-
ing on the nozzle type. No chatter will be pre-
sent in some ranges. Evaluation of chatter is
difficult with hole-type nozzles. This is why
the chatter test is no longer assigned any par-
ticular significance as an assessment tool for
hole-type nozzles.

Spray pattern test
High pressures are generated during this test.
Always wear safety goggles.

The hand lever is subjected to slow and
even pressure to produce a consistent discharge
plume. The spray pattern can now be evalu-
ated. It provides information on the condition
of the injection orifices. The prescribed re-
sponse to an unsatisfactory spray pattern is 
to replace the nozzle or nozzle-and-holder 
assembly.

The pressure gage should also be switched

off for this test.

Pintle nozzle
The spray should emerge from the entire
 periphery of the injection orifice as even
 tapered plume. There should be no concen-
tration on one side (except with flatted pintle
nozzles).

Hole-type nozzle
An even tapered plume should emerge from
each injection orifice. The number of individ-
ual plumes should correspond to the number
of orifices in the nozzle.

Checking the opening pressure
Once the line pressure rises above the opening
pressure, the valve needle lifts from its seat to
expose the injection orifice(s). The specified
opening pressure is vital for correct operation
of the overall fuel-injection system.

Exhaust-gas emissions

Overview, major components

Exhaust-gas emissions

Increasing energy consumption, which is
mainly covered by the energy contained in
fossil fuels, have made air quality a critical is-
sue. The quality of the air we breathe depends
on a wide range of factors. In addition to
emissions from industry, homes, and power
plants, the exhaust gas generated by motor
vehicles also plays a  significant role. In devel-
oped countries, this accounts for about 20%
of total emissions.

Overview

The statutory limits restricting pollutant emis-
sions from motor vehicles have been progres-
sively tightened in recent years. 
In  order to achieve compliance with these 
limits, vehicles have been equipped with
 supplementary emissions-control systems.

Combustion of the air/fuel mixture
A basic rule that applies to all internal-com-
bustion engines is that absolutely complete
combustion does not occur inside the en-
gine’s cylinders. This rule remains valid even
when the combustion mixture contains 
excess air. Less efficient combustion leads to 
an increase in levels of toxic components con-
taining carbon in the exhaust gas. In  addition
to a high percentage of nontoxic  elements,
the internal-combustion engine’s gas also
contains byproducts which – at least when
present in high concentrations – represent
potential sources of environmental damage.
These are classified as pollutants. 

Positive crankcase ventilation
Additional emissions stem from the engine’s
crankcase ventilation system. Combustion
gases travel along the cylinder walls and into
the crankcase. From there, they are returned
to the intake manifold for renewed combus-
tion within the engine. 

Since nothing more than pure air is com-

pressed in the diesel’s compression stroke,
diesel engines generate only negligible
amounts of these bypass emissions. The gases
that make their way into the crankcase contain

only about 10% as much pollution as the by-
pass gases in a gasoline engine. Despite this
fact, closed crankcase-ventilation systems are
now mandatory on diesel engines.

Evaporative emissions
Additional emissions can escape from
 vehicles powered by gasoline engines when
volatile components in the fuel evaporate 
and emerge from the fuel tank, regardless 
of whether the vehicle is moving or parked.
These emissions consist primarily of hydro-
carbons. To prevent these gases from evapo-
rating directly to the atmosphere, vehicles
must be equipped with an evaporative-emis-
sions control system designed to store them
for subsequent combustion in the engine. 

Evaporative emissions from diesels are not
a major concern, as diesel fuel possesses vir-
tually no high-volatility components.

Major components

Assuming the presence of sufficient oxygen,
ideal, complete combustion of pure fuel
would be possible in the following chemical
reaction:

n1 CxHy + m1 O2 (cid:0)

n2 H2O + m2 CO2

The absence of ideal conditions for combus-
tion combines with the composition of the
fuel itself to produce a certain number of
toxic components in addition to the primary
combustion products water (H2O) and car-
bon dioxide (CO2) (Fig. 1).

Water (H2O)
During combustion, the water chemically
bound within the fuel is transformed into
water vapor, most of which condenses when
its cools. This is the source of the exhaust
plume visible on cold days. The proportion 
of water in the exhaust gas is dependent on
the operating point in diesel engines.

Exhaust-gas emissions

Major components

329

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
In complete combustion, the hydrocarbons in
the fuel’s chemical bonds are transformed to
carbon dioxide (CO2). Its proportion is also
dependent on the operating point. Here
again, the proportion depends on the engine
operating conditions. The amount of con-
verted carbon dioxide in the exhaust gas is 
directly proportional to fuel consumption.
Thus the only way to reduce carbon-dioxide
emissions when using standard fuels is to
 reduce fuel consumption.

Carbon dioxide is a natural component of 
atmospheric air, and the CO2 contained in
automotive exhaust gases is not classified 
as a pollutant. However, it is one of the sub-

stances responsible for the greenhouse effect
and the global climate change that this causes.
In the period since 1920, atmospheric CO2
has risen continuously, from roughly 300 ppm
to approx. 450 ppm in the year 2001. This
renders efforts to reduce carbon-dioxide
emissions and fuel consumption more im-
portant than ever. 

Nitrogen (N2)
Nitrogen is the primary constituent (78%) 
of the air drawn in by the engine. Although 
it is not directly involved in the combustion
process, it is the largest single component
within the exhaust gas, at approximately
69...75%.

factors, they depend on
the engine operating

 ambient conditions

Exhaust-gas emissions

Combustion byproducts

Combustion byproducts

During combustion, the air-fuel mixture gen-
erates a number of byproducts. The most sig-
nificant of these combustion byproducts are:
(cid:1) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:1) Hydrocarbons (HC), and 
(cid:1) Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 

Engine modifications and exhaust-gas treat-
ment can reduce the amount of pollutants
produced. 

Since they always operate with excess air,

diesel engines inherently produce much
smaller amounts of CO and HC than gasoline
engines. The main emphasis is therefore on
NOX and particulate emissions. Both of these
types of emissions can be reduced by more
than 90% by using modern NOX  storage cat-
alytic converters and particulate filters.

Carbon monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide results from incomplete
combustion in rich air/fuel mixtures due to 
an air deficiency. 

Although carbon monoxide is also pro-
duced during operation with excess air, the
concentrations are minimal, and stem from
brief periods of rich operation or inconsisten-
cies within the air/fuel mixture. Fuel droplets
that fail to vaporize form pockets of rich mix-
ture that do not combust completely.

Carbon monoxide is an odorless and taste-

less gas. In humans, it inhibits the  ability of
the blood to absorb oxygen, thus leading to
asphyxiation.

Hydrocarbons (HC)
Hydrocarbons, or HC, is a generic desig -
nation for the entire range of chemical com-
pounds uniting hydrogen H with carbons 
C. HC emissions are the result of inadequate
oxygen being present to support complete
combustion of the air/fuel mixture. The com-
bustion process also produces new hydrocar-
bon compounds not initially present in the
original fuel (by separating extended molecu-
lar chains, etc.). 

Aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes,

alkines and their cyclical derivatives) are
 virtually odorless. Cyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (such as benzol, toluol and polycyclic
hydrocarbons) emit a discernible odor. 

Some hydrocarbons are considered to be
carcinogenic in long-term exposure.  Partially
oxidized hydrocarbons (aldehydes,  ketones,
etc.) emit an unpleasant odor. The chemical
products that result when these substances
are exposed to sunlight are also considered to
act as carcinogens under extended exposure
to specified concentrations.

Nitrogen oxides (NOX)
Nitrogen oxides, or oxides of nitrogen, is 
the generic term embracing chemical com-
pounds consisting of nitrogen and oxygen.
They result from secondary reactions that 
occur in all combustion processes where air
containing nitrogen is burned. The primary
forms that occur in the exhaust gases of
 internal-combustion engines are nitrogen 
oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), with
dinitrogen monoxide (N2O) also present in
minute concentrations.

Nitrogen oxide (NO) is colorless and odor-

less. In atmospheric air, it is gradually con-
verted to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Pure NO2
is a poisonous, reddish-brown gas with a 
penetrating odor. NO2 can induce irritation
of the mucous membranes when present in
the concentrations found in highly-polluted
air.

Nitrous oxides contribute to forest damage
(acid rain) and also act in combination with
hydrocarbons to generate photochemical
smog.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
Sulfurous compounds in exhaust gases – pri-
marily sulfur dioxide – are produced by the
sulfates contained in fuels. A relatively small
proportion of these pollutant emissions stem
from motor vehicles. These emissions are not
restricted by official emission limits.

Exhaust-gas emissions

Combustion byproducts

331

It is not possible to use a catalytic converter to
convert sulfur dioxide. Sulfur forms deposits
within catalytic converters, reacting with the
active chemical layer and inhibiting the cat-
alytic converter’s ability to remove other pollu-
tants from the exhaust gases. While sulfur
contami nation can be reversed in the NOX
storage catalytic converters used for emissions
control with direct-injection gasoline engines,
this process requires a considerable amount 
of energy, and consequently negate the fuel-
economy benefits achieved by direct injection. 
The earlier limits on sulfur concen trations

within fuel of 500 ppm (parts per million,
1,000 ppm = 0.1%), valid until the end of
1999, have now been tightened by EU legisla-
tion. The new limits, valid from 2000 onward,
are 150 ppm for gasoline and 350 ppm for
diesel fuels. A further reduction to 50 ppm for
both types of fuel is slated for 2005. In prac-
tice, however, sulfur-free fuel will be intro-
duced sooner. Gasoline and diesel fuel with a
sulfur content of ≤ 10 ppm will already be
available throughout Germany in 2003
(throughout the EU by 2005).

(cid:0)

Greenhouse effect

Shortwave solar radiation penetrates the
earth’s atmosphere and continues to the
ground, where it is absorbed. This process
promotes warming in the ground, which then
radiates long-wave heat, or infrared energy. 
A portion of this radiation is reflected by the
atmosphere, causing the earth to warm.

Without this natural greenhouse effect the
earth would be an inhospitable planet with an
average temperature of –18°C. Greenhouse
gases within the atmosphere (water vapor,
carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dinitrogen
 oxide, aerosols and particulate mist) raise av-
erage temperatures to approximately +15°C.
Water vapor, in particular, retains substantial
amounts of heat. 

Particulates
The problem of particulate emissions is
 primarily associated with diesel engines. 
Levels of particulate emissions from gasoline
 engines with multipoint injection systems are
negligible.

Particulates result from incomplete com-

bustion. While exhaust-gas composition
varies as a function of the combustion
process and engine operating condition, these
particulates basically consist of hydrocarbon
chains (soot) with an extremely extended
specific surface ratio. Uncombusted and
partly combusted hydrocarbons form de-
posits on the soot, where they are joined by
aldehydes, with their penetrating odor.
Aerosol components (minutely dispersed
solids or fluids in gases) and sulfates bond to
the soot. The sulfates result from the sulfur
content in the fuel. Consequently, these
 pollutants do not occur if sulfur-free fuel 
is used.

Carbon dioxide has risen substantially since
the dawn of the industrial age more than
100 years ago. The primary source of this
 increase has been the combustion of coal 
and  petroleum products. In this process, the
carbon bound in the fuels is released in the
form of carbon dioxide.

The processes that influence the green-
house effect within the earth’s atmosphere 
are extremely complex. While some scientists
maintain that anthropogenic (of human origin)
emissions are the primary source of climate
change, this theory is challenged by other
 experts, who believe that the warming of the
earth’s atmosphere is being caused by in-
creased solar activity.

There is, however, a large degree of una-
nimity in calling for reductions in energy use 
to lower carbon-dioxide emissions and combat
the greenhouse effect.

Emission-control legislation

Overview

Emission-control legislation

The state of California assumed a pioneering
role in efforts to restrict toxic emissions ema-
nating from motor vehicles. This develop-
ment arises from the fact that the geography
of large cities like Los Angeles prevents wind
from dispersing exhaust gases, causing a
blanket of fog that smothers the city. The re-
sulting smog not only has damaging impacts
on the health of city dwellers, but also im-
pairs visibility severely. 

Overview

California introduced the first emission-con-
trol legislation for gasoline in the 1960s.
These regulations became progressively more
stringent in the ensuing years. Meanwhile all
industrialized countries have introduced
emission-control laws which define limits for
gasoline and diesel engines, as well as the test
procedures employed to confirm compliance. 

The most important legal restrictions on
 exhaust-gas emissions are (Fig. 1):
(cid:3) CARB legislation (California Air  Resources

Board)

(cid:3) EPA legislation (Environmental  Protection

Agency), U.S.A.

(cid:3) EU legislation (European Union)
(cid:3) Japanese legislation

Classifications 
Countries with legal limits on motor-vehicle
emissions divide vehicles into various classes:
(cid:3) Passenger cars: Emission testing is con-
ducted on a chassis dynamometer.

(cid:3) Light-duty trucks: Depending on national
legislation, the top limit for gross weight
rating is 3.5...6.35 t. Testing is conducted on
a chassis dynamometer (as for passenger
cars).

(cid:3) Heavy-duty trucks: Gross weight rating
over 3.5...6.35 t. The test is conducted 
on an engine test bench. No provision 
is made for vehicle testing.

(cid:3) Off-highway (e.g. construction, agricul-
tural, and forestry vehicles): Tested on 
an engine test bench, as for heavy-duty
trucks.

Test procedures 
Japan and the European Union have followed
the lead of the United States by defining test
procedures for certifying compliance with
emission limits. These procedures have been
adopted in modified or unrevised form by
other countries. 

Legal requirements prescribe any of three
different tests, depending on vehicle class and
test objective:
(cid:3) Type Approval (TA) to obtain General

Certification

(cid:3) Random testing of vehicles from serial pro-

The mass of toxic emissions from each vehi-
cle is determined by operating it in confor-
mity with speed cycles precisely defined for
the test cycle. During the test cycle, the ex-
haust gases are collected for subsequent
analysis to determine the pollutant mass
emitted during the driving cycle. 

For heavy-duty trucks, steady-state ex-
haust-gas tests (e.g. 13-stage test in the EU),
or  dynamic tests (e.g. Transient Cycle in the
U.S.A.) are carried out on the engine test
bench. 

duction conducted by the approval
 authorities (Conformity of Production)

All the test cycles are depicted at the end of
this section.

(cid:3) In-field monitoring for testing certain
 exhaust-gas components in vehicle
 operation

Type approval
Type approvals are a precondition for grant-
ing General Certification for an engine or 
vehicle type. This process entails proving
compliance with stipulated emission limits 
in defined test cycles. Different countries have
defined individual test cycles and  emission
limits. 

Test cycles 
Dynamic test cycles are specified for passen-
ger cars and light-duty trucks. The country-
specific differences between the two proce-
dures are rooted in their respective origins:
(cid:3) Test cycles designed to mirror conditions
recorded in actual highway operation, e.g.
Federal Test Procedure (FTP) test cycle in
the U.S.A.

(cid:3) Synthetically generated test cycles consist-
ing of phases at constant cruising speed
and acceleration rates, e.g. Modified New
European Driving Cycle (MNEDC) in
 Europe.

Testing serial-production vehicles
Testing serial-production vehicles is usually
conducted by the vehicle manufacturer as
part of quality control that accompanies the
production process. The same test procedures
and limits are generally applied as for type
approval. The registration authorities may
demand confirmation testing as often as nec-
essary. EU and ECE directives (Economic
Commission for Europe) take account of
production tolerances by carrying out ran-
dom testing on minimum 3 to maximum 
32 vehicles. The most stringent requirements
are encountered in the U.S.A., and particu-
larly in California, where the  authorities re-
quire what is essentially comprehensive and
total quality monitoring.

In-field monitoring
Random emission-control tests are conducted
in driving mode on vehicles whose running
performance and age are within specific lim-
its. The emission-control test procedure is
simplified compared with  type-approving
testing.

Emission-control legislation

CARB legislation (passenger cars/LDT)

CARB legislation
(passenger cars/LDT)

CARB, or California Air Resources Board
emission limits for passenger cars and Light-
Duty Trucks (LDT) are defined in standards
specifying exhaust-gas emissions:
(cid:3) LEV I
(cid:3) LEV II (Low Emission Vehicle)

Emission limits
The CARB regulations define limits on: 
(cid:3) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:3) Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
(cid:3) Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG)
(cid:3) Formaldehyde (LEV II only)
(cid:3) Particulate emissions (diesel engines: 
LEV I and LEV II; gasoline-engines: 
LEV II only)

Actual emission levels are determined using
the FTP 75 (Federal Test Procedure) driving
cycle. Limits are defined in relation to dis-
tance and specified in grams per mile. 

Within the period 2001 through 2004 the
SFTP (Supplement Federal Test Procedure)
standard was introduced together with other
test cycles. There are also further limits that
require compliance in addition to FTP emis-
sion limits.

The LEV I standard applies to passenger cars
and light-duty trucks with a gross weight rat-
ing up to 6,000 lb. manufactured in model
years 1994 through 2003. Starting model year
2004 the LEV II standard has  applied to all
new vehicles with a gross weight rating up to
14,000 lb.

Phase-in
Following introduction of the LEV II stan-
dard, at least 25% of new vehicle registrations
must be certified to this standard. The phase-
in rule stipulates that an additional 25% of
vehicles must then conform to the LEV II
standard in each consecutive year. 
As of 2007 all new vehicle registrations 
must then be certified according to the 
LEV II standard.

Exhaust-gas categories
Automotive manufacturers are at liberty to
deploy a variety of vehicle concepts within
the permitted limits, providing they maintain
a fleet average (see the section on “Fleet aver-
ages”). The concepts are allocated to the fol-
lowing exhaust-gas categories, depending on
their emission values for NMOG, CO, NOX,
and particulate emissions (Fig. 1):
(cid:3) Tier 1 (LEV I only) 
(cid:3) TLEV (Transitional Low-Emission  Vehicle;

LEV I only)

(cid:3) LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle), applicable to
both exhaust and evaporative emissions

(cid:3) ULEV (Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle)
(cid:3) SULEV (Super Ultra-Low-Emission

 Vehicle)

In addition to the categories of LEV I and
LEV II, two categories define zero-emission
and partial zero-emission vehicles:
(cid:3) ZEV (Zero-Emission Vehicle), vehicles

without exhaust-gas or evaporative emis-
sions

(cid:3) PZEV (Partial ZEV), which is basically
SULEV, but with more stringent limits 
on evaporative emissions and stricter long-
term performance criteria

Since 2004 the LEV II exhaust-gas emission
standard has been in force. The categories
comprising Tier 1 and TLEV are phased out,
and in their place, SULEV is added with
much lower emission limits. The LEV and
ULEV categories remain in place. The CO
and NMOG limits from LEV I remain un-
changed, but the NOx limit is substantially
lower for LEV II. The LEV II standard also in-
cludes new, supplementary limits governing
formaldehyde. 

Long-term compliance
To obtain approval for each vehicle model
(type approval), the manufacturer must prove
compliance with the official emission limits
for pollutants. Compliance means that the
limits may not be exceeded for the following
mileages or periods of useful life: 
(cid:3) 50,000 miles or 5 years (“intermediate use-

ful life”)

(cid:3) 100,000 miles (LEV I)/120,000 miles

(LEV II) or 10 years (“full useful life”)

Manufacturers also have the option of certify-
ing vehicles for 150,000 miles using the same
limits that apply to 120,000 miles. 
The manufacturer then receives a bonus
when the NMOG fleet average is defined 
(see the section entitled “Fleet averages”).
The relevant figures for the PZEV emis-

sion-limit category are 150,000 miles or
15 years (“full useful life”). 

For this type of approval test, the manufac-
turer must furnish two vehicle fleets from 
serial production:
(cid:3) One fleet in which each vehicle must cover

4,000 miles before testing. 

(cid:3) One fleet for endurance testing, in which

deterioration factors for individual compo-
nents are defined. 

336

Emission-control legislation

CARB legislation (passenger cars/LDT)

Endurance testing entails subjecting the vehicles
to specific driving cycles over distances of
50,000 and 100,000/120,000 miles. Exhaust-gas
emissions are tested at intervals of 5,000 miles.
Service inspections and maintenance are re-
stricted to the standard prescribed distances.

Countries that base their regulations on the

U.S. test cycles allow application of defined
deterioration factors to simplify the certifica-
tion process.

Fleet averages (NMOG)
Each vehicle manufacturer must ensure that
exhaust-gas emissions for its total vehicle fleet
do not exceed a specified average. NMOG
emissions serve as the reference category for
assessing compliance with these averages. The
fleet average is calculated from the average fig-
ures produced by all of the manufacturer’s ve-
hicles that comply with NMOG limits and are
sold within one year. Different fleet averages
apply to passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
The compliance limits for the NMOG fleet

average are lowered in each subsequent year
(Fig. 3). To meet the lower limits, manufac-
turers must produce progressively cleaner 
vehicles in the more stringent emissions cate-
gories in each consecutive year. 

The fleet averages apply irrespective of

LEV I or LEV II standards.

Fleet consumption
U.S. legislation specifies the average amount
of fuel an automotive manufacturer’s vehicle
fleet may consume per mile. The prescribed
CAFE value (Corporate Average Fuel Econ-
omy) currently (2004) stands at 27.5 mpg.
This corresponds to 8.55 liters per 100 kilo-
meters in metric terms. At the present time it
is not planned to reduce this limit. 

The value for light-duty trucks is 20.7 miles

per gallon or 11.4 liters per 100 kilometers.
From 2005 to 2007 fuel economy will be raised
each year by 0.6mpg. There are no  regulations
for heavy-duty trucks. 

At the end of each year the average fuel
economy for each manufacturer is calculated
based on the numbers of vehicles sold. The
manufacturer must remit a penalty fee of
$5.50 per vehicle for each 0.1 mpg its fleet 
exceeds the target. Buyers will also have to pay
a gas-guzzler tax on vehicles with especially
high fuel consumption. Here, the limit is 
22.5 miles per gallon (corresponding to 
10.45 liters per 100 kilometers in metric terms).
These penalties are intended to spur devel-
opment of vehicles offering greater fuel econ-
omy.

The FTP 75 test cycle and the highway  cycle
are applied to measure fuel economy (see the
section entitled “U.S. test cycles”).

Zero-emission vehicles
Starting 2003 10% of new vehicle registra-
tions will have to meet the requirements of
the ZEV (Zero-Emission Vehicle) exhaust-gas
category. These vehicles may emit no  exhaust
gas or evaporative emissions in  operation.
This category mainly refers to electric cars. 

A 10% percentage may partly be covered by

vehicles of the PZEV (Partial Zero-Emission
Vehicles) exhaust-gas category. These vehicles
are not zero-emission, but they emit very few
pollutants. They are weighted using a factor
of 0.2 to 1, depending on the emission-limit
standard. The minimum weighting factor of
0.2 is granted when the following demands
are met: 
(cid:3) SULEV certification indicating long-term
compliance extending over 150,000 miles
or 15 years.

(cid:3) Warranty coverage extending over 150,000
miles or 15 years on all emission-related
components.

In-field monitoring
Unscheduled testing
Random emission testing is conducted on 
in-use vehicles using the FTP 75 test cycle 
and an evaporation test. Only vehicles with
mileages of less than 50,000 or 75,000 miles
(varies according to the certification status of
the individual vehicle model) are selected for
testing.

Vehicle monitoring by the manufacturer
Official reporting of claims and damage to
specific emissions-related components and
systems has been mandatory for vehicle manu-
facturers since model year 1990. The reporting
obligation remains in force for a period of 5 or
10 years, or 50,000 or 100,000 miles, depend-
ing on the warranty period applying to the
component or assembly. 

Reporting is divided into three stages with

an incremental amount of detail:
(cid:3) Emissions Warranty Information Report

(cid:3) No evaporative emissions from the fuel sys-

(EWIR)

tem (0 EVAP (Zero Evaporation)),
achieved by extensive encapsulation of the
tank and fuel system.

(cid:3) Field Information Report (FIR)
(cid:3) Emission Information Report (EIR)

Special regulations apply to hybrid vehicles
combining diesel engines and electric motors.
These vehicles can also contribute to achiev-
ing compliance with the 10% limit.

Information concerning: 
(cid:3) problem reports 
(cid:3) malfunction statistics 
(cid:3) defect analysis 
(cid:3) impacts on emissions 

is then forwarded to the environment-protec-
tion authorities. The authorities use the FIR
as the basis for issuing mandatory recall or-
ders to the manufacturer.

EPA (Environment Protection Agency)
 legislation applies to all of the Federal states
where the more stringent CARB stipulations
from California are not in force. CARB regu-
lations have already been adopted by some
states, such as Maine, Massachusetts, and
New York. 

EPA regulations in force since 2004 con-

form to the Tier 2 standard. 

Emission limits
EPA legislation define emission limits for the
following pollutants: 
(cid:3) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:3) Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
(cid:3) Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG) 
(cid:3) Formaldehyde (HCHO) 
(cid:3) Particulates 

Pollutant emissions are determined using the
FTP 75 driving cycle. Limits are defined in re-
lation to distance and specified in grams per
mile.

The SFTP (Supplemental Federal Test Proce-
dure) standard, comprising further test cy-
cles, has been in force since 2002. The applic-
able limits require compliance in addition to
FTP emission limits. 

Since the introduction of Tier 2 standards, ve-
hicles with diesel and spark-ignition  engines
have been subject to an identical  exhaust-gas
emission standards.

Tier 2 (Fig. 1) classifies limits for passenger
cars in 10 bins (emission standards) and
11 bins for heavy-duty trucks. After 2007 bins
9 through 11 will be phased out.

In-field monitoring
Unscheduled testing
In analogy to CARB legislation, the EPA
 regulations require random exhaust-gas
emission testing based on the FTP 75 test
 cycles for in-use vehicles. Testing is conducted
on low-mileage (10,000 miles, roughly one
year old), and higher mileage vehicles
(50,000 miles, and at least one vehicle per 
test group with 75,000/90,000 miles, approx.
4 years old). The number of vehicles tested
varies according to the number sold. 

Vehicle monitoring by the manufacturer
For vehicles after model year 1972, the
 manufacturer is obliged to make an official
report concerning damage to specific emis-
sion-related components or systems if at 
least 25 identical emission-related parts in 
a model year are defective. The reporting
obligation ends five years after the end of the
model year. The report comprises a descrip-
tion of damage to the defective component,
presentation of the impacts on exhaust-gas
emissions, and suitable corrective action by
the manufacturer. The environment-protec-
tion authorities use this report as the basis for
deciding whether to issue recall orders to the
manufacturer.

The transition to Tier 2 have produced the
following changes:
(cid:3) Introduction of fleet averages for NOx.
(cid:3) Formaldehydes (HCHO) are subject to a

separate pollutant category. 

(cid:3) Passenger cars and light-duty trucks with a
GWR up to 6,000 lb. (2.72 metric tons) will
be combined in a single vehicle class.

(cid:3) MDPV (Medium-Duty Passenger Vehicle)
forms a separate vehicle category; previ-
ously assigned to HDV (Heavy-Duty 
Vehicles). 

(cid:3) “Full useful life” is extended to

120,000 miles (192,000 kilometers).

Phase-in
At least 25% of all new passenger-car and
LLDT (Light Light-Duty Trucks) registra-
tions are required to conform to Tier 2 stan-
dards when they take effect in 2004. The
phase-in rule stipulates that an additional
25% of vehicles are then required to conform
to Tier 2 standards in every following year. 
All vehicles are required to conform to Tier 2
standards by 2007. For the HLDT/MDPV cat-
egory, the phase-in period ends 2009.

Fleet averages
NOx emissions are used to determine fleet 
averages for individual manufacturers under
EPA legislation. CARB regulations, however,
are based on NMOG emissions.

Fleet fuel economy
The regulations defining average fleet fuel con-
sumption in the 49 states are the same as those
applied in California. Here again, the limit ap-
plicable to passenger cars is 27.5 miles per gal-
lon (8.55 liters per 100 kilometers).
Beyond this figure, manufacturers are required
to pay a penalty tax. The purchaser also pays a
penalty tax on vehicles that consume more
than 22.5 miles per gallon.

Emission-control legislation

EU legislation (passenger cars/LDT)

EU legislation
(passenger cars/LDT)

The regulations contained in European
Union directives are defined by the EU Com-
mission. Emission-control legislation for 
passenger cars/light-duty trucks is Directive
70/220/EEC from 1970. For the first time it
defined exhaust-gas emission limits, and the
provisions have been updated ever since.

limits (First Registration (FR)). The authori-
ties can also inspect serial-production vehi-
cles to verify compliance with emission limits
(Conformity of Production (COP)). 

EU directives allow tax incentives for vehi-
cles that comply with upcoming exhaust-gas
emission standards before they actually be-
come law. Depending on a vehicle’s emission
standard, there are a number of different 
motor-vehicle tax rates in Germany.

The emission limits for passenger cars
and Light-Duty Trucks (LDT) are contained
in the following exhaust-gas emission stan-
dards: 
(cid:3) Euro 1 (as from 1 July 1992) 
(cid:3) Euro 2 (as from 1 January 1996) 
(cid:3) Euro 3 (as from 1 January 2000) 
(cid:3) Euro 4 (as from 1 January 2005)

Emission limits
The EU standards define limits for the
 following pollutants:
(cid:3) Carbon monoxide (CO)
(cid:3) Hydrocarbons (HC) 
(cid:3) Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
(cid:3) Particulates, although these limits are
 initially restricted to diesel vehicles

A new exhaust-gas emission standard is gen-
erally introduced in two stages. In the first
stage, compliance with the newly defined
emission limits is required for vehicle models
subject to new Type Approvals (TA). In the
second stage – usually one year later – every
new registration must comply with the new

The limits for hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxides for the Euro 1 and Euro 2 stages 
are combined into an aggregate value
(HC+NOX). Since Euro 3, there has been 
a special restriction for NOX emissions in 
addition to the aggregate value.

Emission-control legislation

EU legislation (passenger cars/LDT)

341

The limits are defined based on mileage and
are specified in grams per kilometer (g/km)
(Fig. 1). Since EU 3, emissions are measured
on a chassis dynamometer using the MNEDC
(Modified New European Driving Cycle).

The Type V test assesses the long-term dura-
bility of the emission-reducing equipment. 
It may involve a specific test sequence, or 
it may be subjected to deterioration factors
specified by the legislation. 

The limits are different for vehicles with
diesel or gasoline engines. In future, they will
merge (probably by Euro 5).

The limits for the LDT category are not

uniform. There are three classes (1 to 3) 
into which LDTs are subdivided, depending
on the vehicle reference weight (unladen
weight + 100 kg). The limits for Class 1 
are the same as for cars.

Type approval
While type-approval testing basically corre-
sponds to U.S. procedures, deviations are
found in the following areas: Measurements
of the pollutants HC, CO, NOx are supple-
mented by particulate and exhaust-gas opac-
ity measurements on diesel vehicles. Test
 vehicles absolve an initial run-in period of
3,000 kilometers before testing. Deterioration
factors used to assess test results are  defined
in the legislation for every pollutant compo-
nent; manufacturers are also allowed to pre-
sent documentation confirming lower factors
obtained during specified endurance testing
over 80,000 km (100,000 km starting with 
EU 4).

Compliance with the specified limits must

be maintained over a distance of 80,000 km
(Euro 3), or 100,000 km (Euro 4), or after
5 years. 

Type tests
There are six different type tests for type
 approval. Of those, the Type I test and the
Type V test apply to diesel-engined vehicles. 
The Type I test evaluates exhaust-gas emis-
sions after cold-starting. Exhaust-gas opacity
is also assessed on vehicles with diesel en-
gines. 

CO2 emissions
There are no legal emission limits for CO2.
However, the vehicle manufacturers (Associa-
tion des Constructeurs Européen d’Automo-
biles (ACEA)(Association of European Auto-
mobile Manufacturers) have pledged to up-
hold a voluntary program. The objective is to
achieve CO2 emissions of max. 140 g/km for
passenger cars by 2008 – this is equivalent to
a fuel consumption of 5.8 l/100 km. 

In Germany, vehicles with specially low CO2
emissions (so-called 5-liter and 3-liter cars)
will be tax-exempt until the end of 2005. 

In-field monitoring
EU legislation also calls for conformity-verifi-
cation testing on in-use vehicles as part of the
Type I test cycle. The minimum number of
vehicles of a vehicle type under test is three,
while the maximum number varies according
to the test procedure. 

Vehicles under test must meet the follow-

ing criteria:
(cid:3) Mileages vary from 15,000 km to

80,000 km, and vehicle age from 6 months
to 5 years (Euro 3). In Euro 4, the mileage
specified ranges from 15,000 km to
100,000 km.

(cid:3) Regular service inspections were carried
out as specified by the manufacturer.
(cid:3) The vehicle must show no indications 

of non-standard use (e.g. manipulation,
major repairs, etc.).

If emissions from an individual vehicle fail
substantially to comply with the standards,
the source of the high emissions must be de-
termined. If more than one vehicle displays
excessive emissions in random testing, no
matter what the reason, the results of the ran-
dom test must be classified as negative. 
If there are various reasons, the test schedule

342

Emission-control legislation

Japanese legislation (passenger cars/LDT)

may be extended, providing the maximum
sample size is not reached.

If the type-approval authorities detect that a
vehicle type fails to meet the criteria, the vehi-
cle manufacturer must devise suitable action
to eliminate the defect. The action catalog
must be applicable to all vehicles with the
same defect. If necessary, a recall action must
be started.

Periodic emissions inspections (AU)
In Germany, all passenger cars and light-duty
trucks are required to undergo emissions in-
spection (AU) three years after their first reg-
istration, and then every two years. For gaso-
line-engined vehicles, the main focus is on
CO levels, while for diesel vehicles, the opac-
ity test is the main criterion.

Since the introduction of on-board diagnosis,
the exhaust-gas test also tests whether the
OBD system is functioning correctly to en-
sure monitoring of exhaust-gas-related com-
ponents and systems in use.

Japanese legislation
(passenger cars/LDTs)

The permitted emission values are also sub-
ject to gradual stages of severity in Japan. For
2005 it was decided to introduce a further
stage of severity for emission limits.

Vehicles with a gross weight rating up 
to 2.5 t (starting 2005: 3.5 t) are divided 
into three categories: passenger cars (up to
10 seats), LDV (Light-Duty Vehicle) up to
1.7 t, and MDV (Medium-Duty Vehicle) up
to 2.5 t (starting 2005: 3.5 t). Slightly higher
limits for NOX and particulates apply to the
MDV category compared with the other two
vehicle classes.

Emission limits
Japanese legislation specifies limits for the
following emissions (Fig. 1):
(cid:3) Carbon monoxide (CO)
(cid:3) Nitrogen oxides (NOX)
(cid:3) Hydrocarbons (HC)
(cid:3) Particulates (diesel vehicles only)
(cid:3) Smoke (diesel vehicles only)

Pollutant emissions are measured in the 
10 · 15-Mode Test (see the section entitled
“Japanese test cycle for passenger cars and
LDTs”). A modified 10 · 15 Mode Test, includ-
ing a cold start to be  introduced in 2005, is
under discussion.

Fleet fuel economy
In Japan, measures for reducing the CO2
emissions of cars are planned. One proposal
plans to fix the average fuel economy (CAFE
value) for the entire passenger-car fleet. The
proposal foresees a gradual phase-in of emis-
sion limits by vehicle weight.

U.S. legislation (heavy-duty trucks)

U.S. legislation
(heavy-duty trucks)

Heavy-duty trucks are defined in EPA legisla-
tion as vehicles with a gross weight rating
over 8,500 or 10,000 lb. (equivalent to 3.9 and
4.6 t), depending on vehicle type. 

In California, all vehicles over 14,000 lb.
(equivalent to 6.4 t) are classified as heavy-
duty trucks. To a great extent, Californian leg-
islation is identical to parts of EPA legislation.
However, there is an additional program for
city buses.

Emission limits
The U.S. standards for diesel engines define
limits for: 
(cid:3) Hydrocarbons (HC) 
(cid:3) NMHCs in some cases 
(cid:3) Carbon monoxide (CO) 
(cid:3) Nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
(cid:3) Particulate 
(cid:3) Exhaust-gas opacity 

The permissible limits are related to engine
power output and specified in g/kW. The
emissions are measured on the engine test
bench during the dynamic test cycle with cold

starting sequence (HDTC, Heavy-Duty Tran-
sient Cycle); the exhaust-gas opacity is mea-
sured using the Federal Smoke Test.

New, more stringent regulations apply 
to vehicles starting model year 2004, with 
significantly reduced NOX emission limits.
Non-methane hydrocarbons and nitrogen 
oxides are grouped together in one aggregate
(NMHC + NOX). CO and particulate emis-
sion limits remain at the same level as model
year 1998. 

Another very drastic tightening of emission

restrictions comes into force in model year
2007. The NOX and particulate emission lim-
its will then be 10 times lower than previous
levels. This is probably not achievable with-
out the use of emission-control systems
(e.g. NOX catalytic converters and particulate
filters). 

A gradual phase-in will take place for NOX
and NMHC emission limits between model
years 2007 and 2010. 

To help compliance with severe particulate

limits, the maximum permitted sulfur con-
tent in diesel fuel will be reduced from
500 ppm at present to 15 ppm from mid-
2006.

Emission-control legislation

EU legislation (heavy-duty trucks)

For heavy-duty trucks – in contrast with cars
and LDTs – there are no limits specified for
average fleet emissions and fleet consump-
tion.

Consent Decree
In 1998 a legal agreement was reached be-
tween EPA, CARB, and a number of engine
manufacturers. It provides for sanctions
against manufacturers if they make illegal
modifications to engines to achieve optimized
consumption in the highway cycle,  resulting
in higher NOX emissions. The “Consent De-
cree” specifies that the applicable emission
limits must also undercut the steady-state 
European 13-stage test in addition to the dy-
namic test cycle. Furthermore, emissions are
not allowed to exceed the limits for model
year 2004 by more than 25%, regardless of
driving mode within a specified engine-
speed/torque range (“not-to- exceed” zone). 
These additional tests are applicable to all

diesel commercial vehicles starting model
year 2007. However, emissions in the not- 
to-exceed zone may be up to 50% above 
the emission limits.

Long-term compliance
Compliance with emission limits must be
demonstrated over a defined mileage or
 period of time. Three weight classes are
 defined with long-term compliance require-
ments that gradually become more severe:
(cid:3) Light-duty trucks from 8,500 lb. (EPA) 

or 14,000 lb. (CARB) to 19,500 lb. 

(cid:3) Medium-duty trucks from 19,500 lb. to

33,000 lb.

(cid:3) Heavy-duty trucks over 33,000 lb.

In the case of heavy-duty trucks starting
model year 2004, long-term emission-limit
compliance over a period of 13 years or
435,000 miles must be documented. 

EU legislation
(heavy-duty trucks)

In Europe, all vehicles with a permissible
gross weight of over 3.5 t, or capable of trans-
porting more than 9 persons, are classified as
heavy-duty trucks. The emission-limit regula-
tions are set down in Directive 88/77/EEC,
which is subject to continuous updating. 
As for cars and light-duty trucks, new
emission limits for heavy-duty trucks are in-
troduced in two stages. New engine designs
must meet the new emission limits during
type approval. One year later, compliance
with the new limits will be a condition for
awarding a general vehicle approval. The leg-
islator can inspect Conformity of Production
(COP) by taking engines out of  serial produc-
tion and testing them for  compliance with the
new emission limits. 

Emission limits
For commercial-vehicle diesel engines, the
Euro standards define emission limits for 
hydrocarbons (HC and NMHCs), carbon
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), par-
ticulates, and exhaust-gas opacity. The per-
missible limits are related to engine power
output and specified in g/kW. 

The Euro 3 emission limit level has applied to
all new engine type approvals since October
2000 and also to all production vehicles since
October 2001. Emissions are measured dur-
ing the 13-stage European Steady-State Cycle
(ESC), and exhaust-gas opacity in the supple-
mentary European Load Response (ELR) test.
Diesel engines that are fitted with “advanced
systems” for emissions control (e.g. NOX cat-
alytic converter or particulate filter) must also
be tested in the dynamic European Transient
Cycle (ETC). The  European test cycles are
conducted with the engine running at normal
operating temperature. 

Emissions-control legislation

EU legislation (heavy-duty trucks)

345

The EU 5 level of emission limits will be in-
troduced in October 2008 for all new engine
approvals, and one year later for all new ser-
ial-production vehicles. Only the NOX emis-
sion limits will be more severe compared to
Euro 4. 

Very low-emission vehicles
The EU Directives allow for tax incentives 
for early compliance with the limits specified
by a particular phase of the EU standards, 
and for EEVs (Enhanced Environmentally
Friendly Vehicles). 

Voluntary emission limits are defined for
the EEV category for the ESC, ETC,and ELR
emission-limit tests. The NOX and particulate
emission limits comply with the Euro 5 ESC
emission limits. The standards for HC,
NMHC, CO, and exhaust gas opacity are
stricter than for Euro 5. 

ESC emission limits
ETC emission limits

In the case of small engines, i.e. engines with
a capacity of less than 0.75 liter per cylinder
and a rated speed of over 3000 rpm, slightly
higher particulate emission levels are permit-
ted than for large engines. There are separate
emission limits for the ETC – for example,
particulate limits are approximately 50%
higher than specified for the ESC because of
the soot-emission peaks expected under dy-
namic operating conditions.

In October 2005 the emission limit level Euro
4 enters into force initially for new type ap-
provals, and for serial production one year
later. All emission limits are significantly
lower than specified by Euro 3, but the
biggest increase in severity applies to particu-
lates, for which the limits have been reduced
by approximately 80%. The following
changes will also apply after introduction of
Euro 4:
(cid:3) The dynamic exhaust-gas emission test

(ETC) will be obligatory – in addition to
ESC and ELR – for all diesel engines. 
(cid:3) The continued functioning of emissions-
related components must be documented
for the entire service life of the vehicle.

Japanese legislation
(heavy-duty trucks)

In Japan, vehicles with a permissible gross
weight of over 2.5 t (from 2005: 3.5 t), or ca-
pable of transporting more than 10 persons
are classified as heavy-duty trucks. 

Emission limits
The “New Short-Term Regulation” has been
in force since October 2003. It specifies limits
for HC, NOX, CO, particulates, and exhaust-
gas opacity. Emission levels are measured by
the fixed Japanese 13-stage test (hot test), and
exhaust-gas opacity by the Japanese smoke
test. Long-term compliance for emission 
limits must be documented over a distance of
80,000 to 650,000 km (depending on the per-
mitted vehicle weight). 

The “New Long-Term Regulation” comes into
force in October 2005. Compared with 2003,
the emission limits are halved, and particulate
limits are even cut by 75%. 

(cid:2)

Ozone and smog

Exposure to the sun’s radiation splits nitrogen-
dioxide molecules (NO2). The products are
 nitrogen oxide (NO) and atomic oxygen (O),
which combine with the ambient air’s atomic
oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3). Ozone forma-
tion is also promoted by volatile organic com-
pounds. This is why higher ozone levels must
be anticipated on hot, windless summer days
when high levels of air pollution are present.

In normal concentrations, ozone is essential

for human life. However, in higher concentra-
tions, it leads to coughing, irritation of the
throat and sinuses, and burning eyes. It ad-
versely affects lung function, reducing perfor-
mance potential.

A dynamic Japanese test cycle will also be in-
troduced for this limit stage.

Regional programs
In addition to the nationwide regulations for
new vehicles, there are also regional require-
ments for the overall vehicle population
aimed at reducing existing emission levels by
replacing or upgrading old diesel vehicles.

Since 2003 the “Vehicle NOx Law” has been
in force for vehicles with a permitted vehicle
weight over 3,500 kg, for example in the
greater Tokyo region. The regulation stipu-
lates that 8 to 12 years after first vehicle regis-
tration, the NOx and particulate limits must
comply with the prevailing emission limit
levels (e.g. the 1998 limits starting 2003). 
The same principle also applies to particulate
emissions. Here, the regulation will already
apply 7 years after first vehicle registration. 

There is no direct contact or mutual movement
between the ozone formed in this way at
ground level, and the stratospheric ozone that
reduces the amount of ultraviolet radiation
penetrating the earth’s atmosphere.

Smog is not limited to the summer. It can

also occur in winter in response to atmos-
pheric layer inversions and low wind speeds.
The temperature inversion in the air layers
 prevents the heavier, colder air containing the
higher pollutant concentrations from rising and
dispersing.

Smog leads to irritation of the mucous
membranes, eyes, and respiratory system. 
It can also impair visibility. This last factor
 explains the origin of the term smog, which is
a contraction of “smoke” and “fog”.

U.S. test cycles for passenger cars and LDTs

347

U.S. test cycles for
passenger cars and LDTs

FTP 75 test cycle
The FTP 75 test cycle (Federal Test Proce-
dure) consists of speed cycles that were
 actually recorded in commuter traffic in 
Los Angeles (Fig. 1a).

This test is also in force in some countries
of South America besides the U.S.A. (includ-
ing California).

Preconditioning
The vehicle is subjected to an ambient tem-
perature of 20...30°C in a climatic chamber
for a period of 12 hours. 

Collecting pollutants
The vehicle is started and driven on the spe-
cific speed cycle. The emitted pollutants are
collected in separate bags during various
phases.

Phase ct (cold transient): 
Collection of exhaust gas during the cold test
phase.

Phase s (stabilized): 
Start of stabilized phase 505 seconds after
start. The exhaust gas is collected without 
interrupting the driving cycle. At the end 
of Phase s, after a total of 1,365 seconds, 
the engine is switched off for a period of
600 seconds.

Phase ht (hot transient): 
The engine is restarted for the hot test. The
speed cycle is identical to the cold transient
phase (Phase ct). 

Analysis
The bag samples from the first two phases are
analyzed during the pause before the hot test.
This is because samples may not remain in
the bags for longer than 20 minutes.
The sample exhaust gases contained in the
third bag are also analyzed on completion of
the driving cycle. The total result includes
emissions from the three phases rated at
 different weightings. 

The pollutant masses of Phases ct and s are
aggregated and assigned to the total distance
of these two phases. The result is then
weighted at a factor of 0.43. 

The same process is applied to the aggre-
gated pollutant masses from Phases ht and s,
related to the total distance of these two
phases, and weighted at a factor of 0.57. 
The test result for the individual pollutants
(HC, CO, and NOx) is obtained from the sum
of the two previous results.

The emissions are specified as the pollutant

emission per mile.

SFTP schedules
Test according to the SFTP standard (Supple-
mental Federal Test Procedure) were phased
in from 2001 to 2004. These are composed of
the following driving cycles: 
(cid:3) FTP 75 cycle 
(cid:3) SC03 cycle (Fig. 1b) 
(cid:3) US06 cycle (Fig. 1c)

The extended tests are intended to examine
the following additional driving conditions:
(cid:3) Aggressive driving
(cid:3) Radical changes in vehicle speed
(cid:3) Engine start and acceleration from stand-

(cid:3) Operation with frequent minor variations

ing start

in speed

(cid:3) Periods with vehicle parked
(cid:3) Operation with air conditioner on

348

Emission-control legislation

U.S. test cycles for passenger cars and LDTs

After preconditioning, the SC03 and US06 
cycles proceed through the FTP 75 ct phase
without exhaust-gas collection. Other pre-
conditioning procedures may also be used.

The SC03 cycle is carried out at a tempera-
ture of 35°C and 40% relative humidity (ve-
hicles with air conditioning only). The indi-
vidual driving cycles are weighted as  follows:
(cid:3) Vehicles with air conditioning:

35% FTP 75 + 37% SC03 + 28% US06

(cid:3) Vehicles without air conditioning:

72% FTP 75 + 28% US06

The SFTP and FTP 75 test cycles must be suc-
cessfully completed on an individual  basis.

Test cycles for determining
fleet averages
Each vehicle manufacturer is required to pro-
vide data on fleet averages. Manufacturers
that fail to comply with the emission limits
are required to pay penalties. 

Fuel consumption is determined from the
exhaust-gas emissions produced during two
test cycles: the FTP 75 test cycle (weighted at
55%) and the highway test cycle (weighted 
at 45%). An unmeasured highway test cycle
(Fig. 1b) is conducted once after precondi-
tioning (vehicle allowed to stand with engine
off for 12 hours at 20...30°C). The exhaust-
gas emissions from a second test run are then
collected. The CO2 emissions areused to 
calculate fuel consumption.

MNEDC
The Modified New European Driving Cycle 
(MNEDC) has been in force since Euro 3.
Contrary to the New European Driving Cycle
(Euro 2), that only starts 40 seconds after the
vehicle has started, the MNEDC also  includes
a cold-start phase. 

The 10 · 15-mode test cycle (Fig. 2) is con-
ducted once with a hot start. This test cycle
simulates characteristic driving behavior in
Tokyo. Top speed is lower than in the Euro-
pean test cycle due to the higher traffic den-
sity in Japan. This generally results in lower
driving speeds.

The procedure is as follows: After the vehicle is
allowed to warm up for approximately 15
minutes at 60 km/h, the concentrations of HC,
CO, and CO2 are measured in the exhaust pipe
at idle. The 10 · 15-mode hot test commences
after a second warm-up phase, consisting of 
5 minutes at 60 km/h.

Test cycles for heavy-duty trucks

13-stage test, the European Steady-State  Cycle
(ESC), has been in force in Europe since the
introduction of Euro 3 (October 2000). 

The test procedure specifies measurements
in 13 steady-state operating states  calculated
from the engine full-load curve. The emis-
sions measured at each operating point are
weighted according to certain  factors. This
also apples to power output (Fig. 1). The test
results are obtained for each pollutant by cal-
culating the total of the weighted emissions
divided by the total of the weighted power
output.

Test cycles for heavy-duty
trucks

For heavy-duty trucks, all test cycles are run
on the engine test bench. For nonstationary
test cycles, the exhaust gases are collected and
analyzed using the CVS method (cf. the sec-
tion entitled “Measuring procedures”), while
untreated exhaust gases are measured in the
steady-state test cycles. Emissions are speci-
fied in g/kWh.

Test cycles for heavy-duty trucks

For certification, an additional three NOx
measurements can be taken over the tested
range. The NOx emissions may not vary by a
significant degree from the levels measured at
the adjacent operating points. The aim of the
additional measurements is to prevent any
modification of engines specifically for test-
ing purposes.

As well as Euro 3, the ETC (European Tran-
sient Cycle, Fig. 2) was also introduced to
 determine gaseous emissions and particulate,
and the ELR (European Load Response) test
to measure exhaust-gas opacity. Under the
Euro 3 standards, the ETC applies only to
commercial vehicles with “advanced” emis-
sion-control equipment (particulate filters,
NOx catalytic converters); starting with Euro 4
(October 2005), it will be obligatory for all 
vehicles.

The test cycle is derived from realistic road-dri-
ving patterns and is subdivided into three sec-
tions: an urban section, an extra-urban section,
and a highway section. The length of the test is
30 minutes, and the periods of time for which
engine speeds and torque levels must be main-
tained are specified in seconds.

All European test cycles are performed with
the engine running at normal operating tem-
perature.

Japan
Pollutant emissions are measured using the
Japanese 13-stage steady-state test (hot test).
The engine operating points, their sequence,
and weighting are different from those de-
fined by the European 13-stage test, however.
Compared with the ESC; the test focuses on
lower engines speeds and loads. 
A dynamic Japanese test cycle that comes into
force in 2005 will also be introduced for this
limit stage. 

U.S.A.
Since 1987 engines for heavy-duty trucks
have been tested on an engine test bench
 according to a steady-state test cycle (Tran-
sient Cycle), including a cold-start sequence
(Fig. 3). The test cycle is basically equivalent
to operating an engine under realistic road-
traffic conditions. It includes significantly
more idle sections than the European ETC.
An additional test, the Federal Smoke
 Cycle, tests exhaust-gas opacity under dy-
namic and quasi steady-state conditions.

Starting with model year 2007, U.S. emis-
sion limits must also comply with the Euro-
pean 13-stage test (ESC). Furthermore, emis-
sions in the not-to-exceed zone (i.e. with any
driving mode within a specified engine
speed/torque range) may be max. 50% above
the emission limits.

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas test for 
type approval

During type-approval testing to obtain
 General Certification for passenger cars and
light-duty trucks, the exhaust-gas test is con-
ducted with the vehicle mounted on a chassis
dynamometer. The test differs from exhaust-
gas tests that are conducted using workshop
measuring devices for in-field monitoring. 

For the type approval of heavy-duty trucks,

exhaust-gas tests are carried out on engine
test benches.

The prescribed test cycles on the chassis dy-
namometer stipulate that practical on-road
driving mode must be simulated as closely as
possible. Testing on a chassis dynamometer
offers many advantages compared with on-
road testing:
(cid:0) The results are easy to reproduce since the

ambient conditions are constant.

(cid:0) The tests are comparable since a specified
speed/time profile is driven irrespective of
traffic flow.

(cid:0) The required measuring instruments are
set up in a stationary environment.

Exhaust-gas test for type approval

353

In addition, and for development purposes,
part of the exhaust gas flow can be extracted
continuously from sampling points along the
vehicle’s exhaust-gas system or dilution sys-
tem to analyze pollutant concentrations.

The complete sampling system, including the
exhaust-gas measuring instrument for hydro-
carbons, is heated to 190°C to avoid any con-
densation of hydrocarbons that boil at high
temperatures. 

There is also a dilution tunnel with high in-
ternal flow turbulence, and a particulate filter
whose loading is analyzed to determine par-
ticulate emissions. 

CVS dilution procedure
The most commonly used method of col -
lecting exhaust gases emitted from an engine 
is the Constant Volume Sampling (CVS)
method. It was introduced for the first time in
the U.S.A. in 1972 for passenger cars and light-
duty trucks. In the meantime it has been up-
dated in several stages. The CVS method is
used in other countries, such as Japan. It has
also been in use in Europe since 1982. 

During the dilution process, exhaust gas is
mixed with air, then part of this mixture is
collected in bags. The exhaust gas is only ana-
lyzed at the end of the test. Dilution avoids
condensation of water vapor contained in the
exhaust gases and also prevents the loss of gas
components that are dissolvable in water. 
Dilution also avoid secondary reactions in the
collected exhaust gas, and simulates actual 
dilution conditions in the  atmosphere. 

Besides type-approval testing, exhaust-gas
measurements on the chassis dynamometer
are conducted during the development of en-
gine components. 

Test setup
The test vehicle is placed on a chassis dy-
namometer with its drive wheels on the
rollers (Fig. 1, 3). The test cycle is repeated 
by a driver. During this cycle, the required
and current vehicle speeds are displayed on a
driver monitor. In some cases, an automated
driving system replaces the driver to increase
the reproducibility of test results by driving
the test cycle with extreme precision.

This means that the forces acting on the 
vehicle, i.e. the vehicle’s moments of inertia,
rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag,
must be simulated so that the test cycle on the
test bench reproduces emissions comparable
to those obtained during an on-road test. For
this purpose, asynchronous machines, direct-
current machines, or even electrodynamic re-
tarders on older test benches, generate a suit-
able speed-dependent load that acts on the
rollers for the vehicle to overcome. More
modern machines use electric flywheel simu-
lation to reproduce this inertia. Older test
benches use real flywheels of different sizes
attached by rapid couplings to the rollers to
simulate vehicle mass. A blower mounted a
short distance in front of the vehicle provides
the necessary engine cooling.

The test-vehicle exhaust pipe is generally a
gas-tight attachment to the exhaust-gas col-
lection system – the dilution system is de-
scribed below. A proportion of the diluted ex-
haust gas is collected there. At the end of the
test cycle, the gas is analyzed for pollutants
limited by law (hydrocarbons, nitrogen ox-
ides, and carbon monoxide), and carbon
dioxide (to determine fuel consumption).

354

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas test for type approval

Advances in the CVS method
Diluting the exhaust gas causes a reduction 
in pollutant concentrations as a factor of dilu-
tion. As pollutant emissions have dropped 
significantly in the past few years due to the
growing severity of emission limits, the con-
centrations of some pollutants (in particular
hydrogen compounds) in the diluted exhaust
gas are equivalent to concentrations in diluted
air in certain test phases (or are even lower).
This poses a problem from the measuring-
process aspect, as the difference between the
two values is crucial for measuring exhaust-
gas emissions. A further challenge is presented
by the precision of analyzers used to measure
small concentrations of  pollutants.

To confront these problems, more recent CVS
dilution systems apply the following mea-
sures:
(cid:0) Reduce dilution: This requires precautions
to avoid the condensation of water, e.g. by
heating parts of the dilution system.

(cid:0) Reduce and stabilize pollutant concentra-
tions in the dilution air, e.g. by using acti-
vated charcoal filters.

(cid:0) Optimize the measuring instruments

 (including dilution systems), e.g. by select-
ing or preconditioning the materials used
and system setups; by using modified elec-
tronic components.

(cid:0) Optimize processes, e.g. by applying  special

purge procedures.

Principle of the CVS method
Exhaust gas emitted by the test vehicle is
 diluted with ambient air (10) at an average
ratio of 1 : 5...1 : 10, and extracted using a spe-
cial pump setup (7, 8). This ensures that the
total volumetric flow, comprising exhaust gas
and dilution air, remains constant. The ad-
mixture of dilution air is therefore dependent
on the momentary exhaust-gas volumetric
flow. A sample is continuously extracted from
the diluted exhaust-gas flow and is collected
in one or more (5) exhaust-gas sample bags.
Filling the sample bags generally corresponds
to the phases in which the test cycles are di-
vided (e.g. the ht phase in the FTP 75-test 
cycle).

As the exhaust-gas sample bags are filled, a

sample of dilution air is taken and collected
in one or more (4) air-sample bags in order
to measure the pollutant concentration in the
dilution air.

The sampling volumetric flow is constant
during the bag-filling phase. The pollutant
concentration in the exhaust-gas sample bags
at the end of the test cycle corresponds to the
average value of the concentrations in the di-
luted exhaust gas for the sample-bag filling
period. The pollutant masses emitted during
the test are calculated from these concentra-
tions and from the total air/exhaust gas mix-
ture conveyed from the volume – taking into
account the pollutants contained in the dilu-
tion air. 

Dilution systems
There are two alternative methods to obtain a
constant volumetric flow of diluted exhaust
gas:
(cid:0) Positive Displacement Pump (PDP)

method: A rotary-piston blower (Roots
blower) is used.

(cid:0) Critical Flow Venturi (CFV) method: 
A venturi tube and a standard blower 
are used in the critical state.

Exhaust-gas measuring
 devices

Emission-control legislation in the EU, the
U.S.A., and Japan defines standard test proce-
dures for emission-limit pollutants in order
to measure the pollutant concentrations in
exhaust-gas and air-sample bags: 
(cid:0) Measurement of CO and CO2 concentra-

tions with Non-Dispersive InfraRed
(NDIR) analyzers. 

(cid:0) Measurement of NOX concentrations

 (aggregate of NO and NO2) using Chemi-
Luminescence Detectors (CLD). 

(cid:0) Measurement of total hydrocarbon con-

centrations (THC) using Flame Ionization
Detectors (FID). 

(cid:0) Gravimetric measurement of particulate

emissions.

NDIR analyzer
The NDIR (Non-Dispersive InfraRed)  analyzer
uses the property of certain gases to absorb in-
frared radiation within a narrow characteristic
wavelength band. The absorbed radiation is
converted into vibrational and rotational en-
ergy of the absorbing molecules.

1

NDIR analyzer 

Bag Mini Diluter
As an alternative to advances in CVS technol-
ogy described above, a new type of dilution
system was developed in the U.S.A.: the Bag
Mini Diluter (BMD). Here, part of the ex-
haust-gas flow is diluted at a constant ratio
with dried, heated zero gas (e.g. cleaned air).
During the test, part of the diluted exhaust-
gas flow that is proportional to the exhaust-
gas volumetric flow is filled in (exhaust-gas)
sample bags and analyzed at the end of the
driving test. Diluting the exhaust gas with a
pollution-free zero gas dispenses with air-
sample bag analysis followed by taking the dif-
ference between the exhaust-gas and air-sam-
ple bag concentrations. However, a more com-
plex procedure is required than for the CVS
method, e.g. one requirement is to  determine
the (undiluted) exhaust-gas  volumetric flow
and the proportional  sample-bag filling.

Testing commercial vehicles
The transient test method for testing emis-
sions from diesel engines in heavy-duty
trucks over 8,500 lb. (U.S.) or 3.5 t (Europe) is
performed on dynamic engine test benches
and also uses the CVS test method. This test
came into force in the U.S.A. starting model
year 1986 and is slated for 2005 in Europe.
However, the size of the engines demands a
test setup with a substantially higher
through put in order to keep to the same dilu-
tion ratios as for cars and light-duty trucks.
Double dilution (by means of a secondary
tunnel) permitted by law helps to minimize
equipment costs. 

Under critical conditions, the volumetric

flow rate of diluted exhaust gas is control-
lable, either using a calibrated Roots blower,
or venturi tubes.

The absorption of
 infrared radiation
within a particular
wavelength band 
is possible not only
with the gas compo-
nent measured, 
but also with 
water vapor.

In the NDIR analyzer, the analysis gas flows
through the absorption cell (vessel) (Fig. 1, 2)
where it is exposed to infrared radiation. The
gas absorbs radiation energy within the char-
acteristic wavelength band of the pollutant,
whereby the radiation energy is proportional
to the concentration of the pollutant under
analysis. A reference cell (7) arranged in par-
allel to the absorption cell is filled with an in-
ert gas (e.g. nitrogen (N2)). 

The detector (9) is located at the opposite end
of the cell to the infrared light source and
measures the residual energy from infrared
radiation in the measurement and reference
cells. The detector comprises two chambers
connected by a membrane and containing
samples of the gas components under analy-
sis. The reference-cell radiation characteristic
for this component is absorbed in one cham-
ber. The other absorbs radiation from the
test-gas vessel. The difference between the 
radiation received and 
the radiation absorbed in the two detector
chambers results in a pressure difference, and
thus a deflection in the membrane between
the measuring and reference detectors. This
deflection is a measure of the pollutant con-
centration in the test-gas vessel.

A rotating chopper (8) interrupts infrared 
radiation cyclically, causing an alternating 
deflection of the membrane, and thus a 
modulation of the sensor signal. 

NDIR analyzers have a strong cross-sensitiv-
ity 1) to water vapor in the test gas since H2O
molecules absorb infrared radiation across a
broad wavelength band. This is the reason
why NDIR analyzers are positioned down-
stream of a test-gas treatment system (e.g. 
a gas cooler) to dry the exhaust gas when they
are used to make measurements on undiluted
exhaust gas. 

ChemiLuminescence Detector (CLD)
Due to its measuring principle, the CLD is
limited to determining NO concentrations.
Before measuring the aggregate of NO2 and
NO concentrations, the test gas is first routed
to a converter that reduces NO2 into NO.

The test gas is mixed with ozone in a reaction
chamber (Fig. 2) to determine the nitrogen
monoxide concentration (NO). The nitrogen
monoxide contained in the test gas oxidizes
in this environment to form NO2; some of
the molecules produced are in a state of exci-
tation. When these molecules  return to their
basic state, energy is released in the form of
light (chemiluminescence).

A detector, e.g. a photomultiplier, measures
the emitted luminous energy; under specific
conditions, it is proportional to the nitrogen-
monoxide concentration in the test gas.

Flame Ionization Detector (FID)
The hydrocarbons present in the test gas are
burned off in a hydrogen flame (Fig. 3). This
forms carbon radicals; some of the radicals
are ionized temporarily. The radicals are dis-
charged at a collector electrode; the current
produced is measured and is proportional to
the number of carbon atoms in the test gas. 

Measuring particulate emission
A gravimetric process is a process specified by
law to measure particulate emissions during
type-approval testing. 

Gravimetric process (particulate filter process)
Part of the diluted exhaust gas is sampled
from the dilution tunnel during the driving
test and then channelled through particulate
filters. The quantity of particulate emissions
is calculated from the increase in weight of
the (conditioned) particulate filter, taking
into account volumetric flow. The gravimet-
ric process has the following disadvantages:
(cid:0) Relatively high detection limit, only re-

ducible to a limited extent by using inten-
sive instrument resources (e.g. to optimize
tunnel geometry).

(cid:0) The process requires numerous resources
since the particulate filter requires condi-
tioning to minimize environmental influ-
ences.

(cid:0) Only particulate mass is measured; how-
ever, it is not possible to determine the
chemical composition of the particulate or
particle size.

Due to the disadvantages discussed above, 
as well as the drastic reduction in limits for
particulate emissions anticipated in future,
the lawmakers are considering replacing the
gravimetric process, or supplementing it in
order to determine particle-size distribution
or particle quantity. However, an alternative
process has not yet been found.

The measuring instruments that show par-

ticulate-size distribution in exhaust gas in-
clude the following: 
(cid:0) Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS)
(cid:0) Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI)
(cid:0) Photo-Acoustic Soot Sensor (PASS)

Exhaust-gas measurement 
in engine development

For development purposes, many test
benches also include the continuous mea-
surement of pollutant concentrations in 
the vehicle exhaust-gas system or dilution
system. The reason is to capture data on
emission-limit components, as well as other
components not subject to legislation. Other
test procedures than those mentioned are
 required for this, e.g.:
(cid:0) GC FID and Cutter FID to measure
methane concentrations (CH4).

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Exhaust-gas measurement in engine development

GC FID and Cutter FID
There are two equally common methods 
to measure methane concentration in the test
gas. Each method consists of the combination
of a CH4-separating element and a flame ion-
ization detector. Either a gas-chromotography
column (GC FID), or a heated catalytic con-
verter, oxidizes the non-CH4 hydrocarbons
(cutter FID) in order to separate methane.
Unlike the cutter FID, the GC FID can only
determine CH4 concentration discontinu-
ously (typical interval between two measure-
ments: 30...45 seconds).

ParaMagnetic Detector (PMD)
There are different designs of paramagnetic
detectors (dependent on the manufacturer).
The measuring principle is based on inho-
mogenous magnetic fields that exert forces on
molecules with paramagnetic properties
(such as oxygen), causing the molecules to
move. The movement is proportional to the
concentration of molecules in the test gas and
is sensed by a special detector. 

Opacity measurement
An opacity meter (opacimeter) is used in
 development and in diesel smoke-emission
testing in the workshop during exhaust-gas
testing (see the section entitled “Emissions
testing (opacity measurement)”). 

The smoke-emission test equipment (Fig. 1)
used in development extracts a specified
quantity of diesel exhaust gas (e.g. 0.1 or 1 l)
through a strip of filter paper. As a require-
ment for the high-precision reproducibility of
results, the volume extracted is recorded for
every test sequence and converted to the stan-
dardized quantity. The system also takes ac-
count of pressure and temperature impacts,
as well as dead volume between the exhaust-
gas sample probe and the filter  paper.

The blackened filter paper is analyzed opto-
electronically using a reflective photometer.
The results are generally indicated as the
Bosch smoke number or mass concentration
(mg/m3).

Exhaust-gas measuring techniques

Emissions testing (opacity measurement)

359

Opacity meter (absorption method)
During unrestricted acceleration, a certain
amount of exhaust gas is taken from the
 vehicle’s exhaust pipe (without vacuum
 assistance), using an exhaust-gas sampling
probe and a hose leading to the measuring
chamber. This method avoids impacts arising
from exhaust-gas backpressure and its fluctu-
ations on test results, since pressure and tem-
perature are controlled (Hartridge tester). 
In the measuring chamber, a light beam
passes through the diesel exhaust gas. Attenu-
ation of the light is measured photoelectri-
cally and displayed as a percentage opacity T
or absorption coefficient k. High precision
and good reproducibility of test results are
dependent on a specific measuring-chamber
length and keeping the inspection windows
free from soot. 

Emissions testing 
(opacity measurement)

The procedure for emissions testing in the
workshop comprises the following steps for a
diesel-engined vehicle:
(cid:0) Identifying the vehicle.
(cid:0) Visually inspecting the exhaust-gas  system. 
(cid:0) Testing engine speed and temperature.
(cid:0) Detecting the average idle speed.
(cid:0) Detecting the average breakaway speed.
(cid:0) Opacity measurement: Initiating at least
three accelerator bursts (unrestricted
 acceleration) to determine exhaust-gas
opacity. If opacity figures are below the
limit, and all three measured values are
within a bandwidth of < 0.5 m–1, the  vehicle
passes the emissions test. 

With effect from 2005 Germany also stipu-
lates an on-board diagnosis as part of the
emissions test.
