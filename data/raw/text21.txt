Vehicle Mechanics

Abstract Before embarking on the focus of this book it was felt necessary to
provide a basic understanding of the dynamic forces experienced by any road
vehicle during normal operation. This chapter introduces such forces on a vehicle
when considered as a rigid body. It discusses the source of each force in some detail
and how they may be applied to predict the performance of a vehicle. It extends the
normal straight-line driving to include non-steady state cornering and the case of
car-trailer combinations. Each section generally includes typical problems with
detailed solutions.

1.1 Modelling Philosophy

Most of the analyses of vehicle performance rely on the idea of representing the real
vehicle by mathematical equations. This process of mathematical modelling is the
cornerstone of the majority of engineering analyses. The accuracy of the resulting
analysis depends on how well the equations (the mathematical model) represent the
real engineering system and what assumptions were necessary in deriving the
equations.

A vehicle is a complex assembly of engineering components. For different types
of analysis, it is reasonable to treat
this collection of masses differently. For
example, in analysing vehicle acceleration/deceleration, it may be appropriate to
lump together all the masses and treat them as if the vehicle were one single body, a
lumped mass, with the mass acting at an effective centre of mass, commonly termed
the “centre of gravity”. For ride analyses however, the unsprung masses would
typically be treated separately from the rest of the body since they can move
signiﬁcantly in the vertical direction relative to the body. Also, for an internal
combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, the engine mass may be treated separately to
represent its relative vertical motion on the engine mounts. For driveline analyses,
the masses and inertias of the rotating parts in the engine, gearbox, clutch, drive
shafts etc. may be separated from the rest of the vehicle mass.
Vehicle Mechanics

This lumped mass approach is extremely useful for modelling the gross motions
of the vehicle, i.e. in the longitudinal, lateral or vertical directions. The lumped
masses are assumed to be rigid bodies with the distribution of mass throughout the
body characterised by the inertia properties. Of course, no engineering component
is strictly a rigid body, implying inﬁnite stiffness, although it will in many cases be
a perfectly adequate assumption to treat it as such. The vehicle body, typically made
of pressed steel sections and panels spot-welded together is fairly ﬂexible—a
typical torsional stiffness for a saloon car is around 10 kNm/degree. For other types
of analysis, e.g. structural properties or high frequency vibration and noise prop-
erties, the vehicle body would be treated as a distributed mass, (i.e. its mass and
stiffness properties distributed around its geometric shape) and typically a ﬁnite
element approach would be used for the analysis.

Using the lumped mass approach to a vehicle dynamics problem, the governing
equations of motion can usually be derived by applying Newton’s Second Law of
Motion or its generalised version when rotations are involved which are usually
called the Rigid Body Laws. The approach, which is the preferred method for
tackling the majority of dynamics problems is:
(a) Deﬁne an axis system
(b) Draw the Free Body Diagram (FBD)
(c) Apply the Rigid Body Laws
(d) Write down any kinematic constraints
(e) Express forces as functions of the system variables
(f) The governing set of equations then come from combining (c), (d), and (e).

1.2 Co-ordinate Systems

There is a standard deﬁnition embodied in an SAE standard (SAE J670 Vehicle
Dynamics Terminology) for a co-ordinate system ﬁxed in the vehicle and centred
on the vehicle centre of gravity (C.G.) as shown in Fig. 1.1. Note that the rotational
motions of the vehicle body—roll, pitch and yaw—are deﬁned in the ﬁgure. The
vehicle ﬁxed co-ordinate system which, therefore, moves with the vehicle is useful
for handling analyses. For the analyses of vehicle performance in this chapter,
however, a simple ground ﬁxed axis system is appropriate and the analyses are
restricted to two dimensions involving longitudinal, vertical and pitch co-ordinates.

1.3 Tractive Force and Tractive Resistance

Static and dynamic calculations require an understanding of the dynamic forces and
loads involved during motion. These may be referred to as tractive forces and
resistances. The following sections discuss these loads and associated tyre
properties.

1.3.1 Tractive Force or Tractive Effort (TE)

The tractive effort (TE) is the force, provided by the engine or electric drivetrain,
available at the driven axle road/tyre interface to propel and accelerate the vehicle.
For a conventional ICE vehicle, TE is given by:

TE ¼ Te (cid:2) ng (cid:2) nd (cid:2) g

A typical internal combustion engine power and torque characteristic plotted
against engine speed is shown in Fig. 1.2. Note that the maximum torque and
maximum power occur at different engine speeds. An electric or hybrid electric
drivetrain would have different torque and power characteristic curves. However
drivetrains are not the focus of the current book so are not discussed further.

1.3.2 Tractive Resistances (TR)

A vehicle’s resistance to motion is due to three fundamental parameters: gradient
resistance, aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance (with slow speed manoeuvres,
turning resistance is also important).

1.3.2.1 Gradient Resistance (GR)

If the vehicle is progressing up a gradient, GR is the proportion of a vehicle’s weight
acting down a gradient—the “mg sin h” component as indicated in Fig. 1.3. If the
vehicle is progressing down the gradient, the component would be assisting the
vehicle in which case the force would be termed “gradient assistance”. GR can be
represented as a single force acting at the C.G. of the vehicle and parallel to the road
surface:

Gradient Resistance ðAssistanceÞ ¼ (cid:3) mg sin h

ð1:3Þ

Note:
(cid:129) Gradient Resistance/Assistance is proportional to vehicle weight (mg).
(cid:129) The force normal to the road is always “mg cos h” and, as h tends to zero, the
total normal force at the tyre/road interface approximates to mg, the weight of
the vehicle.

1.3.2.2 Aerodynamic Resistance or Drag Force (D)

The aerodynamic drag force is a measure of the effectiveness of vehicle to progress
through air. It can be represented as a single force acting at the centre of pressure at
some distance above road level. This distance would normally be determined,
initially, by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and conﬁrmed by wind
tunnel testing.

The Drag Force (D) is given by the following equation:

D ¼ 1

where:

q

v

air density

velocity of vehicle relative to surrounding air.

Note:
(cid:129) The drag force is not dependent on the vehicle weight but it is proportional to
the square of the relative velocity. As power is force (cid:2) velocity then the power
required to overcome drag is proportional to the cube of the relative velocity.
(cid:129) The drag resistance is proportional to CD (cid:2) A so the product of these param-
eters determines the overall drag force on a vehicle at a particular velocity.
The drag coefﬁcient is ultimately determined experimentally from wind tunnel
tests. It can also be estimated from a coast-down test providing the other resisting
forces,

important vehicle design parameter from an energy efﬁciency, and hence fuel
economy, point of view. The best passenger cars now have a CD of around 0.3.
Typical values for other vehicles are shown in Table 1.1.

i.e. rolling resistances, are known. The drag coefﬁcient

The drag coefﬁcient is dependent on the element of the vehicle design which
determines how well the air ﬂows round the vehicle. In essence this represents the
“efﬁciency” of the vehicle passing through a ﬂuid. Losses occur if the air is caused
to change direction or even becomes stationary relative to the vehicle, such that the

static pressure increases forward of the vehicle. If air ﬂows quickly over the vehicle
then the static pressure will reduce and in some instances become negative relative
to ambient.

Although for full aerodynamic analysis, the compressibility of the air must be
taken into account, it is instructive to consider the incompressible ﬂow equation, a
common form of Bernoulli’s equation, which is valid at any arbitrary point along a
streamline:

Note that the “gz” term can usually be ignored for a road vehicle.
Clearly, from Eq. (1.5), as the air speed falls the pressure will increase locally.
Conversely as air speed increases, the local pressure will fall and may in fact
become negative to ambient. This explains why papers will be “sucked” through an
open sun roof at high speed.

Figure 1.4 shows streamlines ﬂowing over a Mercedes car in a wind tunnel. It
should be noted that the earlier the air separates from the vehicle, the greater the

“wake” (the area directly behind the vehicle), resulting in an increase in negative
pressure at the rear of the vehicle and an increase in aerodynamic drag. Other losses
occur if the air forms vortices in the wake of the vehicle or if the air is caused to
travel a tortuous path such as that in the engine compartment or the wheel arches.
Such airﬂows are often controlled and may be referred to as “air management”, the
air ﬂow being used to cool the engine and brakes. The positive pressure areas
indicated in Fig. 1.4 may be used to advantage by positioning air intakes at these
points.

As well as horizontal drag forces, aerodynamic ﬂow over a vehicle will also
typically generate vertically downward forces (negative lift). This down force will
aid cornering but will effectively add to the vehicle tyre/road interface force and
increase rolling resistance forces during straight line driving. The aim of formula
racing cars ﬁtted with wings is to balance the increased down force required for
cornering with the accompanying increased wing drag developed on the high speed
straight.

The question may arise about the total area to be considered for calculating
aerodynamic drag if the vehicle is towing a trailer or caravan. A vehicle storage roof
box makes a good deﬂector of air. If no other information is available then it is
usual to add the vehicle and caravan frontal areas together to give an upper limit to
the total overall drag. If this proves to be incorrect then the combination will
perform better than expected. On the other hand, if the frontal area is underesti-
mated, the vehicle may be ﬁtted with too small an engine capacity and the com-
bination will perform badly—it will be underpowered.

1.3.2.3 Rolling Resistance (RR)

The rolling resistance is deﬁned as the force that must be overcome to cause the
vehicle to move at constant speed over a horizontal surface, assuming no vehicle
body aerodynamic forces are present. It is normally assumed that the vehicle is
travelling in a straight line and that the road surface is reasonably smooth. RR is
represented as a force at the road/tyre interface of each wheel. It may be reduced to
a single force acting at the road/tyre interface of each axle.

The rolling resistance arises from two main sources: the continuous deformation
of the tyres during rolling and frictional effects in the mechanical driveline com-
ponents. Rolling tyres undergo a continual cyclical deformation as the tyre passes
continuously through the contact region area. This causes deformation of the
sidewalls and tread area and, because it is not a perfectly elastic process, some
energy is lost through hysteresis (see Fig. 1.5). This lost elastic energy appears as
heat which may be conﬁrmed by “feeling” the tyre temperature after a period of
high speed driving. If the tyre is under-inﬂated then sidewall deformation increases
along with the temperatures. If the vehicle continues to be driven with excessive

1.3 Tractive Force and Tractive Resistance

9

Fig. 1.5 Hysteresis loss within a tyre during loading and unloading

deﬂation then sidewall delamination may occur. In addition, small amounts of
sliding between the tread elements and the road surface occur which add to the
losses. At higher speeds, aerodynamic effects due to air drag on the rotating tyres
again add to the losses.

It is common to lump all the rolling resistance losses for a vehicle together and
approximate them in terms of a rolling resistance coefﬁcient deﬁned by the fol-
lowing equation:

RR ¼ N (cid:2) CR ¼ mg cos h (cid:2) CR

ð1:6Þ

where

rolling resistance

RR
CR coefﬁcient of rolling resistance
N

normal force perpendicular to the surface on which the vehicle is moving.
Note that N will generally be the “mg cos h” element of the vehicle weight
(mg) acting normal to the road surface but should also include any downforce
imposed by aerodynamic effects.

If the vehicle is at standstill then the initial rolling resistance is usually referred to
as starting resistance, akin to static friction conditions. Starting resistance may be
50–80% more than the steady state rolling resistance: CR typically varies from
0.012 rolling to 0.020 starting.

Rolling resistance primarily results from losses in sidewall and tread deformation
resulting in hysteresis losses within the tyre which shows up as heat. The road type
also inﬂuences resistance as the tyre impresses into the surface of the road. It is
generally considered constant but it is in reality speed dependent, rising slightly
with speed. This information would be normally supplied by tyre manufacturers.
Typical values of CR for different vehicles and road surfaces are given in Table 1.2.
The rolling resistance equation is a useful approximation which may be used for
simple “ﬁrst order” calculations to evaluate vehicle transmission loads, performance
and fuel economy. However, rolling resistance, whether expressed as a force or a
non-dimensional coefﬁcient, is not constant in practice.

In particular, the rolling resistance of the tyres, which of course, is a critical

use “slicks” (no tread) in dry weather because they wish to minimise rolling
resistance by reducing/eliminating tread deformation.

tyre wall deﬂections (see Fig. 1.6).

(cid:129) Load and inﬂation pressure. (see Fig. 1.7).

If a normal tyre is inﬂated to the correct pressure, the rolling resistance reduces
and vehicle economy increases. If the tyre is under-inﬂated, the rolling resistance
will increase due to excessive tyre wall deformations. If excessive over-inﬂation
occurs then vehicle handling is affected. Current technology is tending towards

This is a move intended to minimise fuel consumption yet maintain optimum
vehicle performance.

Rolling resistance can also change signiﬁcantly during cornering. At higher
speeds this tends to be less of an issue as aerodynamic drag plays a greater role in
the overall resistances, and dynamic frictional coefﬁcient falls (dynamic friction
coefﬁcient being less than the static, or “stiction”, value). At low speed, such as
urban driving, parking and heavy trafﬁc conditions, aerodynamic drag is less
important and resistance to manoeuvring increases as the tyre/road interface friction
coefﬁcient rises.

In general, the cornering resistance depends on the steered wheel angle (which
depends on the cornering radius), steered wheel load, tyre/road interface friction
level and drive conﬁguration (front, rear or all-wheel drive). Consider the situation
in Fig. 1.8:

where l is the static tyre/road interface friction coefﬁcient (often referred to as
adhesion coefﬁcient) and a is the angle between the steered direction of the wheel
and the forward motion of the vehicle.

Figure 1.9 shows typical variations of the Tractive Resistances (TR) and
Tractive Effort (TE) against vehicle speed for an ICE vehicle. The Tractive Effort
(TE) curve is calculated from the engine torque/engine speed characteristic at a
particular gear ratio as deﬁned in Eq. (1.1). Vehicle speed (v) is derived from the
engine speed, transmission ratios and tyre rolling radius as deﬁned in Eq. (1.2).

It can be seen from Fig. 1.9 that:

At v1, TE is greater than TR and so the vehicle is able to accelerate;
At v2, TE is less than TR and so the resultant is negative and the vehicle will

decelerate;

At v3, TE equals TR and so steady state (constant) speed results.

1.4 Tyre Properties and Performance

A tyre is a means of transmitting the torque developed by the drivetrain to the road
such that the tractive effort available may be used to propel the vehicle. The tyre
must also play its part in slowing the vehicle down when the brakes are applied. It
also has to ensure safe manoeuvring, such as cornering. Because of this it must have
a sufﬁciently high coefﬁcient of friction with the road surface to avoid wheel slip
during acceleration and braking and also to prevent instability during cornering. It
must also be compliant
it should be capable of conforming to the
ever-changing road surface. This means that local deformations should be catered
for along with road undulations and that it must have a reasonable degree of
ﬂexibility if it has to play an effective part of the suspension system. Although the
ﬂexure of the tyre is useful in meeting these demands, the resulting hysteresis losses
contribute signiﬁcantly towards the overall rolling resistance of the vehicle as
described above.

in that

1.4.1 Tyre Construction

There are two types of tyre construction—radial ply and cross (bias) ply. These are
shown in Fig. 1.10. The most common tyres to be found on road cars are radial ply.
The primary advantage of radial ply tyres is that the side walls are more ﬂexible and
so more tread remains in contact with the road during cornering. This is demon-
strated in Fig. 1.11. Figure 1.12 shows the general construction of a radial-ply tyre
in more detail.

Advantages of radial-ply over cross-ply tyres:
(cid:129) Longer Tread Life—Strengthened bracing under tread reduces tread ﬂexure

(“squirm”) in contact patch area.

(cid:129) Cooler Running—Thinner side walls and less friction between plies. Runs

20–30 °C cooler than cross-ply because of lower tread squirm.

(cid:129) Lower Rolling Resistance—Lower hysteresis losses due to less tread squirm as a

result of ﬂexible sidewalls.

(cid:129) Enhanced Comfort—Flexible sidewalls are more forgiving with road undula-
tions, readily absorbing uneven road surfaces. Less vibration transmitted—
quieter.

16

1 Vehicle Mechanics

(cid:129) Increased Impact Resistance—The working (bracing) plies under the tread (see
Fig. 1.10) better protects the inner lining. The longer cords are better placed to
absorb impact stresses (strain energy) due to impacts.

(cid:129) Greater Puncture Resistance—the working belts better resist penetration of road

debris.

(cid:129) Superior Handling—Increased footprint area remains in contact with the road
during cornering (see Fig. 1.11). Due to side wall ﬂexure the tyre slip angle is
less than cross-ply so the vehicle is better able to follow the intended line of
steer.

(cid:129) Better Wet Traction—Steel belts stiffen the tread so it does not deform as much

as cross-ply resulting in better displacement of rain water.

(cid:129) Lower Running Costs—As a result of lower tread wear and lower rolling

resistance.

(cid:129) Reduced Sidewall Damage—Because sidewalls are more resilient (compliant) to

side impacts such as scufﬁng curbs.

Disadvantages of radial over cross-ply tyres:
(cid:129) Poor transport handling, since low lateral stiffness causes the tyre sway to

increase as the speed of the vehicle increases.

(cid:129) Increased vulnerability to abuse when overloaded or under-inﬂated. The side-

wall tends to bulge which could cause damage and puncture.

1.4.2 Tyre Designation

The tyre designation/classiﬁcation information is moulded around the rim of the
tyre, typically as shown in Fig. 1.13.

For example consider the designation 215/65 R 15 95 H where:

215 indicates the width of the tyre in mm.
65

provides the aspect ratio of the tyre wall to tyre width—in this case the wall
height is 0.65 (cid:2) 215 = 139.75 mm.

Load index—ranges from 69 to 100. Load capacity depends on load index
and inﬂation pressure. For example a load index of 95 at 2.9 bar pressure
gives 690 kg load capacity. Tables are supplied that provide such
information.

The unladen tyre diameter D is equal to the wheel diameter + twice tyre wall

height.

Thus, in the above case:

Note:

D ¼ ð15 (cid:2) 25:4Þ þ 2 0:65 (cid:2) 215

ð

Þ ¼ 660:5 mm:

(1) The effective rolling radius of the tyre will be less than suggested by the
unladen diameter due to deﬂections of the tyre under the normal wheel loads.
(2) The heavy weight of the tread, combined with the support belts and ﬂexible tyre
wall, may result in the tyre increasing in diameter at higher speeds. This may
result in the vehicle travelling slightly faster than theoretical predictions—
typically circa 6%.

18

1 Vehicle Mechanics

1.4.3 The Friction Circle

The tyre/road interface force necessary for acceleration, braking and cornering is
dependent on the tyre/road interface friction level and the normal force on the tyre.
The normal force on the tyre should include any load transfer effects and aerody-
namic forces.
In general:

Tyre=road force ¼ Interface friction coefficient (cid:2) Normal force on tyre
F ¼ lN

Under normal operation this force needs to be sufﬁcient to cater for a combi-
nation of braking and cornering or acceleration and cornering resulting in a safe
operating locus referred to as the “Friction Circle” as indicated in Figs. 1.14 and
1.15. In reality the “Circle” is more elliptical rather than circular as the lateral force
is inﬂuenced by the non-linear cornering force/tyre load characteristic of the tyre for
differing slip angles. In general, the “Friction Circle” will provide a ﬁrst order
estimate of the tyre/road adhesion available.

The Friction Circle diameter is determined by the magnitude of total vertical
load (N) and the tyre/road interface friction coefﬁcient (l). This diameter represents
the limit of tyre adhesion before gross sliding/spinning/lock-up of the wheel occurs.
From Fig. 1.15, the resultant horizontal force acting at the interface is given by:

If a combination of longitudinal and lateral force (giving a resultant force R)

1.4.4 Limiting Frictional Force Available

Traction and braking force generated at the tyre/road contact patch are as a result of
small amounts of slip occurring. For braking, this physically means that the actual
forward velocity of the wheel is greater than the forward velocity of the wheel if it
were free rolling at the same rotational speed.

The longitudinal slip, s, during braking is deﬁned as:

s ¼ v (cid:4) Xr
v

where:

v
forward velocity of wheel
r
rolling radius of tyre
X rotational speed of wheel.

Slip is often deﬁned as a percentage:

(cid:3)

v

(cid:2) 100%

ð1:12Þ

Thus, slip ranges from zero when the wheel is free rolling to 100% when the
wheel is locked but still sliding. A typical curve of the relationship between braking
coefﬁcient of friction and wheel slip is shown in Fig. 1.16.

The limiting frictional force available is normally associated with the sliding
condition of the tyre when the wheel is locked up. In fact, this is not the condition
under which maximum braking force is available which occurs at a slip of around
10% (see Fig. 1.16) but locked wheel sliding is the situation most commonly
associated with panic braking. The public perception of this danger has diminished
now that anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have become standard.

Young engineers often ﬁnd confusion between rolling resistance forces, which
are present whenever the vehicle is moving, as discussed in Sect. 1.3.2.3, and

1.4 Tyre Properties and Performance

limiting frictional forces available during acceleration or braking, as discussed in
the current Section. The two sets of coefﬁcients however are almost two orders of
magnitude different, typical values being:

Rolling resistance coefficient ¼ 0:012(cid:4)0:015
Limiting tyre=road friction coefficient ðon a good dry roadÞ ¼ 0:9

The performance of a vehicle (acceleration) is generally based on the power
available (power limited acceleration). As such the tyre/road normal interface force,
along with the associated tyre/road friction coefﬁcient (adhesion coefﬁcient),
determines whether that power may be used. As the tyre/road interface force
depends on load transfer effects during acceleration (or braking), rather complex
calculations aimed at determining the axle/wheel dynamic loads are necessary as
outlined in the following sections.

1.5 Rigid Body Load Transfer Effects

for Straight Line Motion

1.5.1 Vehicle Stationary or Moving at Constant Velocity

on Sloping Ground

The general case of a vehicle on sloping ground is shown in Fig. 1.17. If the vehicle
is stationary or moving at constant speed, then the forces on it can be analysed
using the static equilibrium equations. Note that it has automatically been assumed
in drawing the ﬁgure that the entire vehicle can be treated as a single lumped mass.

1 Vehicle Mechanics

Note also that it is convenient to deﬁne the axis system relative to the sloping
ground. The axle loads can now be found by taking moments about some point. e.g.
the rear wheel contact patch:

N1ða þ bÞ þ Dc þ mg h sin / (cid:4) mg b cos / ¼ 0

ð1:13Þ

This enables N1 to be calculated. Then resolving perpendicular to the slope gives N2:

mg cos / (cid:4) N1 (cid:4) N2 ¼ 0

ð1:14Þ

If the vehicle is stationary, then the aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance
forces would not be present. The force at the rear wheel contact point resulting from
application of the parking brake would then equal the down slope component of
gravity, mg sin /, in order to maintain static equilibrium.

1.5.2 Vehicle Accelerating/Decelerating on Level Ground

The analysis of the forces acting on the vehicle during acceleration or deceleration
is slightly subtler than it ﬁrst appears. In fact, it can be tackled in two ways using
either Newtonian dynamics or the d’Alembert approach.

The Newtonian approach was outlined in Sect. 1.1. This is the preferred method
of tackling dynamics problems. Note that
if the body being analysed is not
accelerating or decelerating then the m€x or I€h terms are zero and the equations
automatically reduce to the equilibrium equations used for static analyses.

An alternative technique is d’Alembert’s approach. There are occasions on
which this has advantages but it is vital to understand the differences between the
two approaches. D’Alembert’s principle allows dynamics problems to be treated as
statics problems. It relies upon adding imaginary forces—commonly referred to as
inertia forces—to the free body diagram and then treating the body as if it were in
static equilibrium. These imaginary forces are mass (cid:2) acceleration ðm€xÞ terms;
they have the units of force but they are not actually forces and so they are fun-
damentally different from the externally applied forces. As such they may be
referred to as pseudo-forces.

It is absolutely crucial to decide which method is being used before starting any
dynamics problem. Getting confused between the two methods is a common source
of errors; a notorious trap is to put “inertia forces” on a free body diagram and then
apply Newton’s Laws. This is to some extent understandable when terms like
centrifugal force have fallen into common usage, despite the fact that it is not a
force at all but one of d’Alembert’s “mass (cid:2) acceleration” terms.

It is recommended that students adhere to the direct approach using Newton’s
Laws of Motion. There are particular situations in which d’Alembert’s principle can
be helpful, but for the majority of problems it offers little advantages.

1.5.2.1 Newtonian Approach

The free body diagram for a vehicle accelerating on level ground is shown in
Fig. 1.18 where:
(cid:129) N1 and N2 are the interface loads between tyre and road
(cid:129) F is the tractive effort (TE) available at the tyre road interface
(cid:129) R1 and R2 are the rolling resistances at each axle
(cid:129) D is the aerodynamic drag
(cid:129) mg is the vehicle weight.

Applying the Rigid Body Laws for the vehicle centre of gravity:
X

Fx ¼ m€x

X

X

Fz ¼ m€z ¼ 0 since €z is zero

MG ¼ IG

€h ¼ 0 since €h is zero

where IG = moment of inertia about C.G.

Equation (1.15) gives:

F (cid:4) D (cid:4) RR ¼ m€x

Thus the tractive effort less any resistance to motion gives the force available to

accelerate the vehicle.

Equation (1.16) as before gives:

mg (cid:4) N1 (cid:4) N2 ¼ 0

ð1:19Þ

That is on a level road the total tyre/road interface forces must equal the vehicle

weight.

ð1:15Þ

ð1:16Þ

If moments are taken about the centre of gravity, Eq. (1.17) gives:

N1a (cid:4) R1h þ Dðc (cid:4) hÞ þ Fh (cid:4) N2b (cid:4) R2h ¼ 0

ð1:20Þ

Numerical problems, usually involving the calculation of the axle loads under
acceleration and braking, can be solved from a combination of these simultaneous
equations. The axle loading changes, i.e. a shift of load on to the rear wheels during
acceleration and on to the front wheels during braking, are referred to as load (or
weight) transfer effects. The use of the term “weight transfer” is not encouraged since
the actual weight (i.e. mg) of the vehicle does not change, nor does its centre of
gravity, but the axle loads do vary dependent on the level of acceleration/deceleration.

Substituting for N2 and F in Eq. (1.20) gives:

N1a (cid:4) R1h þ Dðc (cid:4) hÞ þ ðm€x þ D þ RRÞh (cid:4) ðmg (cid:4) N1Þb (cid:4) R2h ¼ 0

ð1:21Þ

But R1 + R2 = RR and Eq. (1.21) simpliﬁes to:

m€xh þ N1ða þ bÞ (cid:4) mgb þ Dc ¼ 0

1.5.2.2 D’Alembert’s Approach

The pseudo-force or d’Alembert force ðm€xÞ is added to the FBD as shown in
Fig. 1.19 and then the problem may be treated as if it were a static rather than a
dynamic problem.

The moment equation may be calculated around any point since the entire body
is now treated as if it were in equilibrium. Note that this is not the case with the
Newtonian approach where the moment equation may only be applied about the
centre of gravity or a ﬁxed point on the ground about which the body is constrained
to rotate (e.g. at the pivot of a link).

This freedom to take moments about any point actually provides a slight
advantage in solving this particular problem. Note that using the Newtonian
approach, it is necessary to solve three simultaneous equations (Eqs. 1.22–1.24) to
obtain the axle loads N1 and N2. Using the d’Alembert approach these can be
obtained directly by, for example, taking moments about the front wheel:

m€xh þ mga (cid:4) N2ða þ bÞ þ Dc ¼ 0

ð1:28Þ

N2 ¼ mga þ Dc þ m€xh

ða þ bÞ

Taking moments about the rear wheel gives:

From which:

From which:

N1 ¼ mgb (cid:4) Dc (cid:4) m€xh

ða þ bÞ

N1ða þ bÞ þ m€xh (cid:4) mgb þ Dc ¼ 0

ð1:30Þ

It will be noticed again that the m€xh and Dc terms are positive for the rear axle

and negative for the front axle. These terms represent the load transfer effect.

Hence, for this particular problem of the accelerating car, d’Alembert’s approach
has the beneﬁts of being quicker and more efﬁcient in terms of time in obtaining
numerical solutions. The principal cause for concern is that the direction of the
pseudo-force needs to be known. If this force is applied incorrectly the calculations
would be misleading.

1.5.3 Rear Wheel, Front Wheel and Four

Wheel Drive Vehicles

Although a vehicle’s performance may not be limited by power it may be limited by
the tractive effort which a vehicle may develop before wheel-slip occurs. That is the
maximum transmission torque which the drivetrain may usefully transmit between
tyre and ground and is directly related to the tyre/road interface load and the tyre/
road interface friction (adhesion) coefﬁcient. Since it has been shown that the load
transfer effect causes the tyre/road interface load to vary during acceleration (or
braking) then the added complication of a caravan or trailer may inﬂuence the
choice of drive for the vehicle (see Sect. 1.5.4).

In general we have:

where “F” is the tractive effort demand and Ni is the normal load on the ith axle.
Re-arranging gives the so-called friction demand or required adhesion coefﬁcient

li to avoid wheel spin on that axle:

Thus front wheel drive performance is limited by the axle load of the front wheels
which effectively reduces as the vehicle acceleration increases. Rear wheel drive
performance is limited by the rear wheel axle load which effectively increases as the
vehicle acceleration increases. With 4-wheel drive it is assumed that the full weight
of the vehicle may be utilised and that the weight transfer effect plays no part in the
performance of a vehicle. In practice the transfer box on a 4-wheel drive vehicle will
usually be designed to split the transmission torque between front and rear axle in
proportion to the anticipated axle loads of the vehicle so that the full vehicle weight
may be used. If this “balance” is not maintained, possibly because of the addition of
a trailer, then the full weight of the vehicle may not be employed and the traction
limit will be controlled by the axle load most below the design load for the particular
tyre/road adhesion coefﬁcient. However modern 4-wheel drive vehicles employ a
traction control system to distribute the torque most effectively.

1.5.4 Caravans and Trailers

From Fig. 1.22 it will be noticed that there are 2 additional forces when a caravan or
trailer is coupled to a vehicle, the longitudinal force (T), known as the drawbar pull
which is zero under static conditions, and the vertical hitch load (N2). The car now
has 4 unknowns and the caravan (trailer) has 3 unknowns. Under normal condi-
tions, the vertical hitch load will be positive (downwards) on the vehicle and

negative (upwards) on the trailer. Also, during acceleration, the drawbar pull will be
negative (rearward) on the vehicle and positive (forward) on the trailer.

A single axle trailer will normally increase the rear axle load under static con-
ditions. During acceleration this hitch load will reduce if sufﬁciently high accel-
erations are experienced. Combined with poor trailer load distribution, this hitch
load may in fact become negative with a subsequent reduction in rear axle loading
and effective increase in front axle loading. In a dynamic situation, when the
combination is moving, the aerodynamic drag forces may also play an important
role and then the trailer height will reﬂect on the hitch loads and subsequently the
axle loads.

tance coefﬁcient of 0.012.

Under static conditions, both acceleration ð€xÞ and T = 0.
As before we have 3 equations of motion to solve as deﬁned in Eqs. (1.15–1.17).

This level of friction demand (adhesion coefﬁcient) should be exceeded under

It is suggested to the reader to repeat the above example using d’Alembert

approach.

1.6 Rigid Body Load Transfer Effects During Cornering

It has been shown that
acceleration/deceleration is given as:

the longitudinal

load transfer effect

(LTE) due to

and that due to aerodynamic drag as:

LTE€x ¼ (cid:3) m€xh
ða þ bÞ

LTED ¼ (cid:3) Dc
ða þ bÞ

The positive sign in the above equations relates to the rear axle and negative sign
to the front axle. Since the centre of gravity is generally along the central axis of the
vehicle then the longitudinal load transfer effect may be considered as equal for
each wheel on a single axle.

During cornering there is a lateral load transfer effect due to the cornering, i.e.
centrifugal, forces. This lateral load transfer effect tends to increase the load on the
outer wheels and reduce the load on the inner wheels. As the centre of gravity is
generally not centrally displaced along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, there is a
need to proportion the cornering load transfer effect to the front and rear wheels—
see Fig. 1.23.
We have:

Centrifugal force ðCFÞ ¼ mv2
R

where m is vehicle mass, v is forward velocity of vehicle and R is the radius of the
turn.

Thus the lateral load transfer effect is given by:

LTECF ¼ CF

h
T

where h is the height of the C.G. and T is the wheel track width.

As the centre of gravity is assumed to be centrally displaced between the axles,
and the longitudinal LTE has already been proportioned front/rear, then the front/
rear lateral LTEs as calculated above are added to the outer wheel and deducted
from the inner wheel. It is now possible to determine the load on each wheel.

By example, the individual wheel LTE terms for a vehicle braking during a
left-hand turn are as shown in Table 1.3. It will be noted from Table 1.3 that
summing all the individual loads for each wheel leads to the vehicle weight “mg”.
To determine the lateral adhesion (friction) demands on each wheel is difﬁcult

but generally follows the usual calculation:

Lateral tyre=road interface force demand ðFÞ ¼ lN or l ¼ F
N

As an example, the tyre/road interface demand at each wheel is determined as
follows under ﬁrstly steady state cornering (no braking or acceleration) and sec-
ondly, under cornering with acceleration/braking.

Thus the friction demand on the rear left wheel is equal to that on the rear right

From the above it is seen that for steady state cornering each wheel will
demand equal adhesion on the front axle and equal adhesion on the rear axle. This
means that tyre slip will be axle based rather than wheel based. As such the loss of
control will be when the axle demanding the highest adhesion exceeds the friction
limit for the particular tyre/road conditions. Thus the tyre characteristics play an
important role in this scenario with the tyre load/slip angle characteristic deter-
mining over/under steer.

1.6.2 Non-steady State Cornering

When acceleration or braking is included, the resultant tyre/road interface force
needs to be determined. The centrifugal force is a body induced force (acting at the
C.G.) and could therefore be proportioned to each wheel dependant on axle and
wheel loading. Braking and traction cannot be so proportioned as the torque is an
input to the wheel and the motive force acts at the tyre/road interface.

1.6 Rigid Body Load Transfer Effects During Cornering

39

Unless an anti-lock braking system (ABS) is deployed, the braking force for
each wheel on the front axle will be the same, and the braking force for each wheel
on the rear axle will be the same. With traction, the force per wheel will vary due to
the differential and possibly yaw control on the driven axle. In general, the wheel
forces are not inﬂuenced by tyre loading until the required adhesion is exceeded and
the wheels will then either lock-up or slide.

With reference to Figs. 1.14 and 1.15, the resultant force in the case of combined

centrifugal force (CF) and braking force (BF) is as follows:

It is seen the friction demands are now different for each wheel. From the above,
the rear left wheel demands the highest adhesion coefﬁcient so will be the ﬁrst to
experience problems. However all the above friction demands are readily achiev-
able under normal road conditions.

1.7 Concluding Remarks

This chapter has introduced basic topics surrounding the mechanics of road vehi-
cles, knowledge of which is necessary to understand and appreciate the more
detailed material contained in the remaining chapters of the book. Particular
attention has been paid to the importance of the tyres as the principal means of
generating sufﬁcient traction/braking and cornering force to control the vehicle in a
safe and reliable manner. The importance of being able to calculate wheel loads
allowing for load transfer effects has been emphasised using rigid body assump-
tions. In Chap. 3 of the book we will see that more accurate calculations require the
ﬂexibilities within the vehicle body, primarily in the suspension system, to be taken
into account. Nonetheless the above theory should enable the design engineer to
make reliable estimations of the wheel loads and total tyre/road interface forces on
all wheels during both straight line and non-steady state cornering conditions. In
addition, it should be possible to predict conditions when the calculated adhesion
limits may be exceeded and vehicle handling becomes a problem. Modern vehicles
of course employ sophisticated control systems such as ABS to monitor wheel
loads and then proportion braking or traction accordingly with the aim that the
friction demands should be equal for all wheels.

Chapter 2
Steering Systems

Abstract The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide the automotive engi-
neer with a basic understanding of steering systems. It reviews current and modern
designs with accompanying theories regarding the forces within the systems, both
static and dynamic.
It considers power assistance and the move towards
steer-by-wire as full electronic control becomes increasingly reliable. The theory is
supported by worked examples and “case studies” that more readily demonstrate
their application. As such the engineer should be in a position to develop appro-
priate in-house computer-aided design packages that meet a speciﬁc need without
unnecessary peripheral features. The chapter begins by introducing requirements
and regulations that govern the basic design strategies. It continues with consid-
eration of steering geometry and current common designs. The forces imposed on
the steering system, both for a stationary and moving vehicle, are introduced along
with the move towards electric steering systems. The chapter concludes by con-
sidering four wheel steer and additional steering assistance.

2.1 General Aims and Functions

Within the automotive industry there is no stand-alone subject area as all systems
interact with each other, the design decisions in one area impacting on that of
another system. As such steering and suspension systems should be developed with
close co-operation between the respective designers. As always, safety plays a
signiﬁcant role in any design and in particular in steering systems since drivers
interact with the steering whereas they do not generally have control of the sus-
pension system. Ride comfort and road handling are therefore regarded as a more of
a quality and reﬁnement issue. Because of the safety implications and driver
interface, steering design is guided by international regulation with which all OEMs
must comply. These guidelines are outline at the beginning of the next section.

The basic aim of a steering system is to rotate the steered wheels in response to

driver input and thus provide overall directional control of the vehicle.

Steering Systems

In order to do this the function of an effective steering system must be to:
(cid:129) Provide a reliable connection system between the steered wheels and the dri-

ver’s steering wheel input.

(cid:129) Provide controlled kinematic relationships to achieve the correct steer angles of

both inner and outer wheels.

(cid:129) Minimise steering effort yet maintain driver “feel”.

In all cases the steering system employed must be safe and must comply with the

current regulations as outlined below.

OF

2.2.1 General Requirements

(cid:129) The actuating force must be harmonious to the centre as far as the end stop and
must not decrease. The reason is to ensure the driver is always in control of the
input.

(cid:129) It must be possible to drive the vehicle accurately, i.e. without any unusual

steering corrections.

(cid:129) Play in the mechanical parts is impermissible. This means that if the driver

reverses direction there is no “backlash” or “take-up” in the system.

(cid:129) The entirety of the mechanical transmission devices must be able to cope with

all loads and stresses occurring in operation.

(cid:129) Unusual driving manoeuvres, such as driving over obstacles and accident-like
occurrences must not lead to any cracks or breakages. A crack is possibly the
worst scenario as this may propagate and fail at some later time.

(cid:129) If the actuating force at the steering wheel for a normal passenger car exceeds
150 N, power assistance is necessary. If such power assistance fails, an actu-
ating driver force of 300 N must not be exceeded.

(cid:129) For a normal passenger car, it must be possible to turn the front wheels into the
position corresponding to a turning radius of 12 m in 4 s with a force of 150 N

2.2.2 Steering Ratio

Steering ratio is deﬁned as the ratio of steering wheel rotation angle (lock to lock) to
steer angle movement of the road wheels (lock to lock).

Normal steering wheel rotation (lock to lock):
3–3.5 turns
Typical steered wheel angles to give minimum turning circle for passenger cars:
±35°

48

2 Steering Systems

Note:
(1) designs are now being developed where ±75° steered wheel angle is becoming

(2) London taxis have a high steered wheel angle of ±60° which gives greater

realistic

manoeuvrability.

Typical steering ratios (steering wheel angle to steered wheel angle):
(cid:129) Passenger cars

15–20:1

(lower value for power assisted steering and higher value for manual steering)

(cid:129) Trucks

30–40:1

The actual steering ratio may vary from the design value due to steering torque

reactions acting against compliance within the steering system.

2.2.3 Steering Behaviour

The requirements in terms of steering behaviour can be summarised as follows:
(cid:129) Jolts from irregularities in the road must be damped out before they reach the
steering wheel. However such damping must not cause the driver to lose contact
with the road—the “feel” element.

(cid:129) The basic design of the steering kinematics must satisfy the Ackermann con-
ditions (see below). This is not necessarily always achieved, or desired, because
inﬂuences such as tyre slip, steering geometry (camber) and
of external
suspension/geometric inﬂuences.

(cid:129) By means of suitable stiffness of the steering system (particularly if rubber

elements are used) the vehicle must react to minute steering corrections.

(cid:129) When the steering wheel is released, the steered wheels must return automati-
cally to the straight ahead position and must remain stable in that position.
(cid:129) The steering ratio must be as low as possible in order to obtain ease of handling

and give a responsive steering system.

(cid:129) The resulting steering forces at the steering wheel are not only inﬂuenced by the
steering ratio but also by the front axle loading, the size of the turning circle, the
wheel suspension (castor, steering-axis inclination, steering roll radius), the tyre
tread and the speed of vehicle (the dynamic forces).

2.3 Steering Geometry and Kinematics

49

2.3 Steering Geometry and Kinematics

2.3.1 Basic Design Needs

A fundamental requirement of all current steering systems is to connect both steered
wheels on an axle to ensure they remain at some related position to each other
regardless of turn angle i.e. there is a need to ensure a kinematic relationship
between the two wheels. A basic way to achieve this is as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each
wheel is connected to a knuckle or upright which is connected to the chassis
through some swivel mechanism. Each of the knuckles is then connected to a
track-rod using ball joints so that, when a lateral force is applied to this track-rod,
their relevant pivot and so
both wheels move together, rotating/rolling about
changing the vehicle direction.

The force along the track rod may be applied by hydraulic, mechanical or
electrical means or any combination of these. Such a basic system connects the
wheels during steering but does not provide for the wheels to satisfy the Ackermann
angle requirements. This Ackermann criteria requires each of the steered wheels to
be rotated by a different amount so that they are orientated to trace a true rolling
radius about a common turning point as indicated in Fig. 2.2.

True Ackermann steering is virtually impossible to achieve over the full range of
steering angles using practical linkage designs. Nor is it necessarily desirable since
real turning manoeuvres invariably involve some tyre sideslip as discussed below.
However the trapezoidal geometry involved in the design shown in Fig. 2.3 comes
close to providing Ackermann geometry which may require the inner wheel to
rotate through considerably greater angles than the outer wheel as indicated in
Fig. 2.4.

This most convenient geometry to approximate this need is to direct the steering
arms to intersect the rear rigid axle at its centre as shown in Fig. 2.3. With such
geometry the wheels rotate about the chassis pivot points to adopt the angles as
indicated in Fig. 2.4. The angles of the steering arms should be noted as this will
result in different torques being applied to each wheel and a possible ﬂuctuation in
steering force as felt at the steering wheel. If this does happen then there will be a need
to modify the torque over the steering range to give a uniform steering wheel force.

2.3 Steering Geometry and Kinematics

51

It must be noted that regulations state that this force at the steering wheel should not
reduce as the wheel is turned away from the neutral position.

It should also be noted how the track arm moves to achieve Ackermann steering.
This movement needs to be accounted for in any steering gear design that is rigidly
mounted on the chassis. Tie rods are normally used to allow for such movement of
the steering arms as indicated in Fig. 2.4.

Maintenance of Ackermann geometry is more important for specialised, lower
speed vehicles, e.g. taxis and delivery vehicles, which spend more of their time in
low speed turning manoeuvres; minimisation of tyre scrub and steering efforts are
important in these conditions. The classic London taxi is designed with close to
perfect Ackermann geometry up to its 60° maximum inner wheel steer angle.

2.3.2

Ideal Ackermann Steering Geometry

The nominally ideal geometry involved in a vehicle following a curved path is
deﬁned as the Ackermann geometry as shown in Fig. 2.5.

From Fig. 2.5, it can be seen that, assuming the wheels are rolling perfectly (i.e.
no sideslip), the following basic expressions describe the inner and outer wheel
angles:

Simplifying so that the outer angle may be calculated from the inner angle gives:

where L is the wheelbase and R is the mean radius of turn at the rear axle.

The theoretical track turning circle diameter ðDsÞ as measured at the suspension

intercept at the ground (Fig. 2.6) is then given by the following equation:

Clearly, to minimise DS, the wheelbase “L” needs to be as small as possible and
Þ as large as possible. This requires an even larger inner

wheel angle ðdiÞ. However this inner wheel angle is limited by packaging con-
straints such as foot-well space, axle and suspension components and, on front
wheel drive vehicles, the working angle of the drive joints and the need to ﬁt snow
chains.

The difference between the inner ðdiÞ and outer steer angle doA

ð

Þ is known as the

differential steer angle ðdAÞ or toe difference angle, i.e.:

If a steer angle error is accepted then, because the inner wheel is restricted due to
packaging constraints, the outer wheel must turn to a greater angle to reduce the
Þ and
turning circle. The difference between the true Ackermann outer angle doA

ð2:8Þ

It is normal to restrict the “error” to within some industry standard with technical
manuals being obliged to state the deviation, or ﬂaw, at an inner wheel angle of 20°.
With some vehicles, the deviation may in reality become negative at low angles
which indicates the outer wheel turns more than the inner wheel even at low turn
angles where packaging is not such an issue. This may be an additional design
intention as wheel camber is related to castor angle (see castor inclination angle),
and camber becomes an important feature. At high speeds (low steer angles), it may
be a desire to increase negative camber on the outer, most heavily loaded, wheel. In
addition, during high speed manoeuvring, tyre sideslip angles are involved and the
need to satisfy Ackermann steering geometry becomes less important.

In general it would be normal for a vehicle manufacturer to have some form of
policy to achieve a target deviation, typically 60% of true Ackermann (i.e. 60% of
required differential steer angle) at full lock.

2.4 Review of Common Designs

2.4.1 Manual Steering

The main function of the steering system is to provide a connection between the
steered wheels and the driver’s steering wheel. It is the primary means by which the
driver exercises directional control over the vehicle. In the past, regulations insisted
on a mechanical
link between the steering wheel and the steered wheels.
Technological advances have reached a level where this mechanical link is no
longer a requirement which allows true “steer-by-wire” systems to be employed.
This technology is now widespread but it is still common to include a mechanical
link between the steering wheel and steered wheels.

Because the forces and moments involved can be large, some form of power
assistance is commonly provided in order to control the driver effort involved to
acceptable levels (the work done element of force versus distance). If the system is
totally power controlled then there must be some form of steering wheel resistance

introduced to give the driver “feel” for the interaction between tyre and road during
manoeuvres.

The design of a steering linkage involves controlling the kinematic relationships
to achieve the correct steer angles at the inner and outer steered wheels as discussed
above. However, these basic kinematic relationships are modiﬁed by several fea-
tures: changes in suspension deﬂection, compliances from suspension bushes and
forces/moments arising from the drivetrain (tractive effort). Hence, although some
of the design principles involved in the steering kinematics may be viewed in
isolation, a complete analysis of behaviour in practice must include the entire
suspension system plus drivetrain if appropriate.

The discussion here concentrates on front wheel steering (FWS). Rear wheel
steering (RWS) was generally restricted to specialised off-road (typically dumper
trucks) or loading vehicles (fork trucks), although it is now being introduced in
combination with FWS to create four wheel steering systems. Such advanced
systems allow greater manoeuvrability for parking and better dynamic handling
during high speed lane changes.

There are two fundamentally different steering system designs: the rack and
pinion system and the steering box systems as discussed below. All linkage designs
are very much dictated by space availability.

2.4.2 Rack and Pinion System

In passenger car design, the most common mechanism in current circulation is the
rack and pinion (Fig. 2.7). Rotation of the steering wheel controls rotation of the
pinion, often through a steering column which includes a pair of universal joints for
access reasons, which then controls translational motion of the rack. The ends of the
rack are connected to the steering arms of the steered wheels by tie rods as shown in
Fig. 2.8. It is these tie rods that account for movement of the track arms as shown in
Fig. 2.4.

Recent developments in rack and pinion steering systems have focused on
variable ratio designs, in which the effective steering gear ratio varies with steering
wheel angle, and on enhancements to the power assistance systems to try and
provide the best compromise between ease of control and good feedback to the
driver. Figure 2.9 shows the geometry of a variable pitch rack that provides more

even steering force over the full range of steered wheel movement to account for
“effective” changes in steering moments. From Fig. 2.9, we have:

Steering ratio ¼ Steering wheel diameter

or

d2

Steering wheel diameter
d1

Clearly the smaller the denominator the higher the steering ratio, resulting in a
lower force being necessary at the steering wheel around the centre (straight ahead)
position.

2.4.3 Steering Box Systems

Because of their robust design, steering box systems are normally found on com-
mercial or off-road vehicles and heavy cars. Figure 2.10 shows a screw and cam
follower design where the cam follower is connected to the Pitman arm shaft. Many
different designs exist, typically, cam and roller, worm and nut, worm and roller and
recirculating ball as shown in Fig. 2.11. The fundamental difference relative to the
rack and pinion design is that the steering gearbox converts rotary motion of the
steering wheel into rotary motion of a steering arm, commonly termed a “Pitman”
arm. This “Pitman” arm is connected to a steering linkage which steer the wheels.
Two different installations are shown in Fig. 2.12 (simple drag link connected
directly the one of the wheel’s steering arm with a link connection between the two
wheels) and Fig. 2.13 which shows a more complex linkage mechanism with power
assistance provided by the hydraulic cylinder.

Good steering system design requires precision between the input and output
sides of the steering box, so particular attention is paid to the avoidance of
backlash (lost motion between mating parts because of clearances between them).
Backlash can be experienced when the direction of movement is reversed and the

lost motion is taken up before the reversal of motion begins. Steering efﬁciencies in
the forward and reverse direction were at one time an important design criteria,
although they have become less so with the increased use of sophisticated power
steering systems. For a manual steering system it is beneﬁcial to maintain a high
forward efﬁciency in order to keep steering forces low. The reverse efﬁciency
(back-driving), however is a compromise; a low value minimises the transmission
of road roughness disturbances back to the driver but at the expense of removing
some of the driver feel.

2.4.4 Hydraulic Power Assisted Steering (HPAS)

To reduce the force required at the steering wheel, hydraulic pressure may be used
to assist the movement of either the rack or the linear movement of the ball screw in
a steering box. In either case the system must now include a hydraulic “power
pack” in the form of a reservoir and pump. Since steering needs to remain within
the control of the driver, the ﬂow of oil to the steering system needs to cease when
the driver stops steering. This may be achieved using either an orbital metering unit
or a rotary ﬂow distributor.

2.4 Review of Common Designs

59

2.4.4.1 Orbital Metering Unit

This comprises a small orbital metering pump that is supplied with ﬂuid under
pressure. Its sole function is to pass oil from the “power pack” to the steering
mechanism in a controlled manner. Connection between the steering wheel and the
steering mechanism is now by hydraulic hose rather than by mechanical linkages.
The ﬂow of ﬂuid is linearly proportional to the rotation of the steering wheel. If the
steering wheel is not turned then no ﬂuid is metered through the unit and the oil
bypasses it under nominal back-pressure. As such pressure is only generated as
needed so energy is not wasted. This type of steering is used on heavy industrial
vehicles such as earth movers, bulldozers, diggers, cranes etc.

2.4.4.2 Rotary Flow (Valve) Distributor—Fig. 2.14

In this case the ﬂow of ﬂuid is governed by a degree of “twist” in a torsion bar (item
6 in Fig. 2.14) within the steering column. The degree of rotary twist is limited by a
loose spline at its inner end. Note that it is this mechanical connection that allows
steering to be still performed if the hydraulics fail—but the manual load will be
high. As the steering wheel is turned, the torsion bar is caused to twist as the road
wheels remain stationary. This difference in torsional displacement causes a rotary
valve to open which allows ﬂuid to be directed to the appropriate end of the steering
mechanism. If the steering wheel stops rotating the ﬂuid continues to be transferred
to the steering mechanism until the “twist” in the steering column returns to zero.
The rotary valve then closes. Such a system is shown in Fig. 2.14 for a steering
rack, a similar hydraulic arrangement being used for a steering box.

2.4.4.3 Reaction Control Valve

The reaction control valve is a spool (shuttle) valve which is used in steering box
assemblies. When the steering wheel is turned the recirculating ball screw engages
with the nut so driving it in a desired direction. This is the normal function of the
steering box which results in rotation of the Pitman arm. At the same time there is
residual rotational drag between the screw and nut which, if allowed, causes the nut
to rotate slightly in the same direction as the screw rotation. A small lever on the nut
engages with the spool valve and as the nut rotates it causes the valve to move
linearly. Oil under pressure is then directed to the appropriate side of the box to
assist steering. If an opposite rotation is applied to the steering wheel then the nut
rotates slightly in the opposite direction so causing a change in the spool position,
and delivery direction. Under no input from the steering wheel, the spool valve will
take up a central position due to self-centring springs and the oil is directed back to
the reservoir under nominal back-pressure.

2.4.5 Electric Power Assisted Steering (EPAS)

The problems with hydraulic PAS is that there is a need to ensure the operating
hydraulic pressure is always available. In virtually all cases, the pump will be a
ﬁxed deliver pump, typically a vane type pump. Even though by-pass valves may
be employed (oil not “blowing-off” over a pressure valve) the engine has to provide
power to overcome the back-pressures, and this requires fuel. To mitigate this
problem the “assist” element may be obtained using electric motors. This operating
principle may also offer more steering control such as variable speed/force char-
acteristics—typically,
the steering force required increases during parking
manoeuvres. The general criteria for EPAS may be listed as follows:
(cid:129) Safe operation in all driving situations and a very high level of availability.
(cid:129) Highly dynamic response characteristics in the most varied driving situations.
(cid:129) A sufﬁcient level of steering assist for the driver in the case of intensive actu-

ation forces, for example, parking manoeuvres.

(cid:129) Minimal noise during all steering manoeuvres; for this vehicle function, acoustic

brand.

(cid:129) More and more steering functions are being integrated into modern EPAS
systems, which improve safety or comfort for the driver, and can be corre-
spondingly marketed by the vehicle manufacturers.

The general layout of a column-mounted EPAS system is shown in Fig. 2.15.
Note that the steering column still exists. This ensures steering is still “possible” in
cases of electrical failure. To minimise motor torque and therefore size, the motor

speed will be high and as such a high gear ratio between motor and steering gear
will be necessary. Two such methods of reduction are the worm and wheel as
shown in Fig. 2.16 and the harmonic drive as shown in Fig. 2.17.

The “worm” is driven by an electric motor which rotates the wheel. The wheel
may be ﬁtted to a recirculating ball nut which rotates and causes a ball screw to
move linearly so replacing the function of the rack. The ratio is given as:

The harmonic drive is used within a column mounted steering unit (Fig. 2.18)
along with electric power assistance. It uses a rigid external gear (annulus) that has
more teeth than its mating ﬂexible internal gear. An elliptical cam rotates inside the

ﬂexible gear causing the teeth to mesh at its extremes and to disengage at the
narrow section of the cam. The difference in the number of teeth on the annulus and
ﬂexible gear causes the internal gear to rotate signiﬁcantly slower (dependant on the
number of teeth differential) than the input cam (motor) speed. As such the output
torque will be higher by the same ratio (assuming 100% efﬁciency).

Harmonic drive ratio ¼ Flexible gear teeth (cid:2) Annulus teeth

Example If the annulus has 202 teeth and the ﬂexible gear has 200 teeth, then:

Drive ratio ¼ 200 (cid:2) 202

¼ (cid:2)0:01

200

Thus speed reduction is 100:1 and the negative sign indicates output rotation in

opposite direction to input.

The worm and wheel reduction gearing is stronger than the harmonic drive and
is also capable of reasonably high reduction ratios (typically 100:1). It tends to be
rather bulky and heavier which is a disadvantage. Backlash is avoided by having
the bearings mounted in “elastic” mounts and the worm may then be pushed into
positive engagement with the wheel.

Superposition steering responds to driver input and is speed related. The torque
demand is detected by induction coils within the EPAS system. The greater the
rotary displacement (e.g. in parking), the greater the torque demand. There is also
vehicle speed feedback that reduces torque demand as speed increases such as in
high speed driving.

Dependant on the packaging constraints, the motors may be included within the
steering column or on the steering mechanism itself. Drive may still be rack and
pinion but rotary ball screws now become an option as shown in Figs. 2.19, 2.20
and 2.21.

With full electric steer, it may become possible to provide linear motion at the
steering gear using hollow motors and recirculating ball screws. If this were
adopted then each wheel may be controlled independently to account for tyre slip
and individual wheel camber. In the case of the recirculating ball screw being used
within the steering gear, the nut is held axially yet is caused to rotate by the electric
motor. The screw is constrained from rotating so moves axially providing the axial
force to steer the wheels. Such a system is shown in Fig. 2.22. The power required
by the motor depends on the force demand, distance travelled and the time for the
full movement.

2.4.6 Steer-by-Wire

It will be noted that within both the HPAS and EPAS systems shown above, there is
still a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the steered wheels as
previously required by the regulations. As the control systems and safety protocols
have advanced, the regulations have been relaxed and this is no longer a require-
ment. This gives the designer much more versatility in positioning the steering
wheel/unit. Indeed it would be possible to have a vehicle whereby the steering
could be passed across the vehicle, changing left hand to right hand drive within

minutes. The sensation of using a steering wheel still exists but is no longer
restricted to conventional mechanisms—joystick, twist grips or other forms of
control now being an option.

Because there is no longer a mechanical connection between the steered wheels
and the steering wheel, there is a need to include a “reaction torque actuator” that
gives the driver steering “feel”. This may be achieved using a resistance poten-
tiometer to provide a resistance torque that may be directly related to vehicle speed.
In addition it has been mentioned above that independent steering to left and right

66

hand wheels is now a possibility. In such cases steering may be adjusted to be speed
related e.g. when parking or indeed when braking or accelerating (toe-in/out). Also
acceleration/deceleration controllers can be used to integrate the wheel torques and
steering to give predictive yaw control.

2.5 Steering “Errors”

The previous sections have described the various ways in which the wheels may be
turned to provide vehicle direction. The ideal situation would be to have the wheels
rotating around a true arc with zero tyre scrub. It has been shown that this may
achieved in theory using Ackerman geometry. It is difﬁcult enough to achieve this
through geometric design alone and its realisation becomes increasingly difﬁcult for
a variety of reasons classiﬁed as steering “errors”. These errors are due to general
compliance and operational characteristics such as tyre slip, compliance in the
mechanical system (elastomeric components) and set-up (geometric) errors. The
designers’ challenge is to understand these anomalies and include them in the
design strategy to improve vehicle handling.

2.5.1 Tyre Slip and Tyre Slip Angle

The previous idealised geometry is based on a vehicle using hard tyres. Modern
tyres take a different path than intended when subjected to a side force. Figure 2.23
shows the plan and end view of a wheel, initially moving in the direction indicated.
If a side force is applied to the wheel as indicated, the wheel will take a different
path to the direction the wheel points, even though the wheel is still pointing in the
original direction. The angle between the path the wheel is actually taking and the
plane of the wheel is termed the “slip angle” (a). This term is slightly misleading
since the tyre does not actually slip and the term “creep angle” may be a better
description. However the term slip angle is in common use.

The slip angle is caused by the deﬂection of the side wall and tread. It is
proportional to the side force acting on the tyre but not in a linear manner. The
greater the tyre aspect ratio (tyre wall height to width) the greater the slip. As such,
low aspect ratio tyres have less slip than high aspect ratio tyres. This is true until the
tyre is caused to slide. Up to this point the following applies:

The cornering power (CP) of a tyre is governed by:

increase.

2.5.1.1 Effect of Slip Angles on Ackermann Geometry

As mentioned above the need to develop true Ackermann geometry is not so
important in reality because of the effects of slip angle on the resulting geometry.
This is shown more clearly in Figs. 2.24 and 2.25.

Understeer is preferred on normal road cars as this tends to keep the driver in
control of the vehicle. Racing car drivers may prefer oversteer to enhance cornering
abilities but this requires advanced driving skills that are generally absent from
normal drivers. If both the front and rear slip angles are the same then, although the
car still “slips”, there is no over or under-steer and the term “neutral steer” is used.

2.5.2 Compliance Steer—Elastokinematics

“Compliance Steer” is the change in steer angle of front or rear wheels resulting
from compliance in suspension and steering linkages as produced by forces and/or
moments applied at the tyre/road contact. In essence compliance steer results from
deformation of elastomeric elements within the steering and suspension system as a
result of wheel forces from the road/tyre interface.

There are over 70 elastomeric components (elastomer/metallic composites) on a
typical car. In brief they are pseudo-bearings—that is, the two connected parts are
allowed to move relative to each other but not continuously as with rolling element
bearings. They are designed in a variety of forms, generally providing rotational

and/or translational constraint. They are used to enhance comfort but may degrade
with age and affect vehicle handling performance. The science of elastomers and
elasto-kinematics is complex and may be used to provide differing characteristics in
different directions of component part movement (Fig. 2.26). These ﬁgures show a
cylindrical or bush type (mainly rotational) and sandwich type (mainly compres-
sion). If the elastomer compound is removed from any region then the compliance
(spring stiffness) will be changed in that direction. This section is concerned only
with the elastomeric parts found in suspension and steering systems such as shown
in Fig. 2.27.

There are two types of Compliance Steer:

Compliance understeer—compliance steer which increases vehicle understeer or
decreases vehicle oversteer.
Compliance oversteer—compliance steer which decreases vehicle understeer or
increases vehicle oversteer.

Generally understeer is better than oversteer as the steering control remains with
the driver—the driver is always turning into the corner. Oversteer may require a
correcting reversal of direction by the driver. Figures 2.28 and 2.29 demonstrates
the effect of such deformations on the oversteering and understeering of a vehicle
for two different rear suspension arrangements.

The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by
the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions. When the vehicle
is decelerating, the trailing arm pivots towards the rear as the wheel is “pulled”
backwards relative to the chassis (Fig. 2.28). This results in “toe out”, which
makes the vehicle unstable as it adds to the desired steering direction creating
oversteer.

Fig. 2.29 Weissach axle semi trailing arm suspension

For the Weissach axle (Fig. 2.29), the front pivot bushing of the trailing arm is
replaced by a short link. In this arrangement, when the vehicle decelerates and the
wheel is “pulled” back, the result is “toe-in” at the rear. This adds to stability by
reducing oversteer and is a design principle adopted by Porsche. It exempliﬁes how
the designer has used elastomer deﬂections to an advantage in reducing oversteer by
subtracting from the driver’s chosen steering direction, leading to the desired effect
of understeer.

It should be noted that any designed “toe-in” effect should take into consider-
ation the understeer which may be experienced by a negative castor on the rear
causing understeer (toe-in) as a result of side forces during cornering.

During normal operation a wheel may move linearly forward and rearward
typically by the order of a total of 26 mm, that is 14 mm forward and 12 mm
rearward. In general it is desired that the wheel moves linearly fore/aft and does not
toe-in or out at the front wheel. As such, the positions of the ends of the track arms
(connections to tie rods) and steering arms are carefully selected, along with
compliant bushings, to avoid any tendency to toe-in. If these positions are selected
incorrectly then geometric errors are induced resulting in bump and roll steer.

2.5.3 Steering Geometry Errors

The idealised treatment normally considers the suspension geometry in plan-view
and in isolation. In practice this geometry is modiﬁed as the wheel moves up and
down on the suspension. The additional constraint imposed on the wheel motion by
the tie rod connected to the steering mechanism can cause additional steering effects
during bump or roll motions. Such effects are usually small but nevertheless can
have an important inﬂuence on vehicle handling, steering feel and tyre wear.

The interaction between steering and vertical suspension movement is controlled
by the locus of the outer end of the tie rod. If this is coincident with the locus of the
steering arm joint (attached to the hub), then no steer effects will occur. In relation
to the two dimensional view shown in Fig. 2.30, the ideal centre of rotation for the
tie rod can be calculated from geometry. Even this geometrical calculation may not
be perfect because three dimensional effects are ignored. Hence CAD systems or
purpose-design suspension kinematics packages are normally used for the sus-
pension and steering layout.

2.5.3.1 Bump and Roll Steer

Figure 2.30b and c illustrate two possible effects in a qualitative fashion. In
Fig. 2.30b the position of the tie rod, assuming it is mounted to the rear of the
suspension, causes a toe out effect to occur as the wheel moves either in jounce

2.5 Steering “Errors”

73

(bounce) or rebound. However, if the inboard end of the tie rod were mounted
inboard of the ideal point, then a toe-in effect would occur. If the error was sym-
metrical then no resulting steer effect would occur. On the other hand, if one wheel
tie rod was inboard and the other outboard then during a bump or rebound incident
the wheels would tend to steer together either left or right, giving rise to bump steer.
In Fig. 2.30c, the tie rod on the left hand wheel is mounted above the ideal point.
This causes a right hand steer during bounce (toe-in) and a left hand steer during
rebound (toe-out). The opposite effect occurs at the right hand wheel. Thus during
body roll, both wheels steer in the same direction. For example, a right hand turn
(positive steer) will cause the body to roll outwards to the left, giving rise to bounce
motion at the left wheel and rebound motion at the right. Both wheels will steer to
the right, (i.e. into the turn) thus giving an oversteer effect, giving rise to roll steer.
It is clear that this arrangement should be avoided on “normal” vehicle designs.

2.5.3.2 Self-conﬁrmation

Strike a true radius using the relay link details of Fig. 2.30a. Then, on the same
drawing, strike a new radius using the outboard position of the steering link in
Fig. 2.30b—note how the shorter radius blends at the steering arm ball joint but
will “pull” the steering arm in at any other position (because of the shorter radius),
causing the wheel to toe out (you may repeat with inboard position where the wheel
will toe in as the radius is larger). Similarly strike a revised radius using the new
position of the relay link as in Fig. 2.30c. Note how this curve and the idealised
curve cross at the steering arm ball joint, being out-board above the ball joint and
in-board below the ball joint. This causes the steering arm to “push out” (toe-in)
during bump and “pull in” (toe-out) during rebound. This results in the wheels
steering in the same direction during vehicle roll giving rise to roll steer.

Important Geometric Parameters in Determining
Steering Forces

2.6.1 Front Wheel Geometry

The important elements of a steering system not only comprise the steering linkages
as described above but also steer rotation about the steer rotation axis. The steer
angle is achieved by rotation of the steered wheel about a rotation axis. This is
generally not vertical and is tipped inboard at the top producing a lateral inclination
angle and also tipped in a longitudinal plane to produce a castor angle. This
combination of two inclined angles creates the “kingpin axis” and is this axis about
which the wheel rotates. The general geometry for the lateral inclination angle and

the castor angle is as shown in Fig. 2.31. It is this geometry that determines the
forces and moment reactions within the steering system.

This combined angle is the wheel axis of rotation or the swivel axis as shown in
Fig. 2.32. The lateral inclination angle, commonly known as the “kingpin” incli-
nation angle, may vary between 0–5° for trucks and 10–15° for passenger cars, the
difference being due to vertical space availability. The intersection of the kingpin
axis with the ground does not normally coincide with the centre of the tyre contact
patch, there being a deliberate offset. This lateral offset (d) may be referred to as the
scrub radius and is regarded as negative if it falls outboard of the tyre contact
patch centre and positive if it falls inboard of the contact patch, as shown in
Figs. 2.32 and 2.33 respectively.

The longitudinal inclination angle is referred to as mechanical (or kinematic)
castor, positive castor being when the intercept at the ground is forward of the tyre
contact patch. This distance (e) is known as the kinematic castor trail or
mechanical trail. Castor angles normally range from 0 to 5°.

2.6.2 Kingpin Inclination Angle (Lateral Inclination Angle)

The kingpin inclination angle has the effect of causing the vehicle to rise when the
wheels are turned. This creates a self-aligning moment which depends on the
kingpin inclination angle, the scrub radius (offset at the ground) and the castor
inclination angle.

Figure 2.33 shows arrangements for a double wishbone suspension and
McPherson strut suspension both with positive lateral offset. It should be noted that
the axis passed through both the upper and lower swivel joints for the double
wishbone whilst for a McPherson strut the axis passes through the upper swivel
joint at the body and the lower swivel joint on the lower suspension arm—it is not
the axis through the damper/spring itself. With this arrangement the effect of the
body weight is to maintain the wheel in the straight ahead position.

2.6.3 Castor Inclination Angle (Mechanical Castor)

Castor inclination axis is the inclination of the swivel axis in a longitudinal
direction, shown positive in Fig. 2.34. The intercept of the axis with the ground
provides a moment arm (kinematic castor trail) which in turn provides a speed
dependent self-aligning moment resulting from lateral forces:

where “v” is vehicle velocity, “m” is proportion of vehicle mass on the front tyres
and “R” is turning radius.

An increased offset at the road will tend to increase self-alignment such that it
may be felt at the steering wheel, thereby increasing steering effort. To take
advantage of castor/camber offsets but maintain an acceptable steering effort, it may
be necessary to introduce “castor offset at the hub”, shown as “t” in Fig. 2.34.
This reduces the moment arm at the tyre contact by the distance “t” and is negative
so giving a reduced overall offset at the ground (e − t). The beneﬁts of negative
castor offset at the hub, combined with positive castor angle, are that the kinematic
castor trail is reduced so that the inﬂuence on steering from uneven road surfaces is
reduced and that camber alteration is maintained when wheels are turned
(Fig. 2.35).

For the steered wheels the camber angle changes as a function of the steer angle
as shown in Fig. 2.35. In this example, it can be seen that, with increasing castor
angle, there is a tendency to produce positive camber at the inboard wheel (circa
6.5°) and negative camber on the outside wheel (circa 3.8°) thus improving turn-in
response. Since front wheel drive vehicles also create a self-righting moment due to
the tractive forces, the resulting increased self-righting moment caused the designer
in this case to introduce negative castor. This had the disadvantage of creating
positive camber on the outside wheel during a turn and possibly an unstable situ-
ation—the negative castor will cause oversteer which in turn causes increased
lateral forces. When negative castor is introduced to the non-steered rear wheels, the
resulting moment, and system compliance, provides a toe-in effect creating
understeer which assists in high speed lane changes.

2.7 Forces Associated with Steering a Stationary Vehicle

The maximum forces at the steering wheel occur when the vehicle is stationary; in
practice, these forces also occur during slow speed parking manoeuvres. The forces
arise from two effects—the frictional resistance due to the tyre scrubbing on the
road and the jacking of the vehicle.

2.7.1 Tyre Scrub

The tyre contact patch and its relationship with the swivel axis is shown in
Fig. 2.36. Estimating the moment acting around the scrub axis (scrub moment MS)
relies on some approximations and some empirical evidence. First, if the tyre
contact patch is assumed to be circular (diameter = a) and the pressure distribution
is uniform, then the moment required to turn the tyre around the centre of the
contact area may be calculated by ﬁrst considering the centre point steering case.
For centre-point steering the axis of swivel is about the centre of the tyre.
Although this leads to light dynamic steering loads during driving it gives heavy
static steering loads as the tyre “scrubs” about its contact patch. With such an

To reduce this load and provide dynamic “feel” for the driver the swivel centre is
moved away from the centre of the tyre by a distance “d”. With this arrangement
the tyre tends to have a higher degree of roll and less “scrub”.

An empirical equation is now used for dealing with this geometry which
involves identifying an effective moment arm and a revised coefﬁcient of friction.

The effective moment arm is given by the equation:

The equation for scrub moment now becomes:

ð2:15Þ

The effective coefﬁcient of friction (µe) is obtained from empirical curves pro-
vided by the tyre manufacturer. A typical example is shown in Fig. 2.38 for a
passenger car tyre on dry concrete. Using this curve it is seen with Centre Point
Steering and d/a = 0 then the coefﬁcient of friction is at its highest at around 0.8.
The friction then rapidly drops to an approximately constant value of around 0.2
over the typical range of values of “d/a” used in practice. Such a graph may also be
presented as MS/W on the “y” axis against swivel offset “d” on the “x” axis.

Jacking of the Vehicle

When the wheel is turned, the body will move upwards and the moment around the
swivel axis to achieve this, MJ, the jacking moment, can be derived by ﬁrst
equating the rate of work involved at the swivel axis to that involved in jacking.
Figure 2.39 shows the geometry involved with a view along the swivel axis and
below the wheel indicating the locus of the wheel centre as the steer angle, a,
increases.

Summing the scrub and jacking moments gives the total moment at each wheel:

Total moment at the left hand wheel = 594 + 28 = 622 N m
Total moment at the right hand wheel = 594 + 42 = 636 N m
Note order of magnitude difference between scrub and jacking moments.

2.7.3 Forces at the Steering Wheel

A plan view of a steering system using a steering box is shown in Fig. E2.1a. The
horizontal force in the centre of the track rod is the sum of two horizontal com-
ponents arising from the moments around the swivel axles at each wheel. The force
at the track rod is determined as indicated in Figs. E2.1a and E2.1b.

From Fig. E2.1c, we have:
Linear force at rack (F) (cid:6) Pitch circle radius of pinion (r) = Tangential force at

For a given steering force required at the rack, the overall steering force ratio is

therefore given by:

ð

Þ ratio ¼ F=E ¼ R=r

It will be seen that the ratio is inversely proportional to the pinion radius. If the
radius changes so does the ratio. This may assist in providing a constant force when
the force at the rack varies due to the effective length of the steering arms changing
as the road wheels turn. Such a technique is shown in Fig. 2.7 where a variable
pitch rack gives rise to an effective change in the pinion radius and so a variable
steering ratio.

that the torque at the steering wheel is 75 N m. The maximum angle “b”, as
indicated in Fig. E2.1a, is ±37° and the steering wheel lock to lock is 3.5 turns. It is
intended to replace the steering box with a rack and pinion mechanism with an
initial selection using a constant pitch rack and 7 tooth pinion with 3 module tooth
form (3 mm addendum) with an expected overall efﬁciency of 97%.

The task is to investigate the viability of replacement of the steering box and the

impact on driver perception.

It is required to determine the steering wheel torque with the new arrangement
and whether it will be seen by the driver as signiﬁcantly different. Work done is the

If the tooth module was to remain the same at 3 mm and the track travel was to

2.8 Forces Associated with Steering a Moving Vehicle

The complete sets of forces and moments acting on a rolling tyre is shown in
Fig. 2.40 using the SAE J670e tyre axis system. All three forces plus three asso-
ciated moments affect the moment around the swivel axis. These are:
(cid:129) Vertical force (normal wheel load) and rotational aligning moment
(cid:129) Lateral force (cornering) and rotational overturning moment
(cid:129) Longitudinal force (traction/braking) and rotational rolling resistance moment.

The moments around the swivel axis of each wheel are summed through the
steering system and eventually act through the steering gear to be felt at the steering
wheel. Each of these forces are considered in turn below.

2.8.1.1 Effect of Lateral Inclination Angle

This has effects due to both the swivel axis inclination and the castor angle. The ﬁrst
of these is the same as the jacking effect discussed above. Using the SAE axis
system, the swivel axis effect results approximately in a moment for the left hand
wheel as shown in Fig. 2.41.

Moment ¼ (cid:2)Fzl sin kd sin a

ð2:18Þ

The moment is negative because rotation is anticlockwise. Note that the moment
is in a direction to return the wheel to a dead ahead position, creating a self-centring
effect.

Similarly the moment for the right hand wheel is:

Moment ¼ (cid:2)Fzr sin k d sin a

During steer, the moments resulting from the vertical load and swivel axis
inclination angle on both the left and right wheels act together to produce a
cumulative centring moment.

It is appropriate to resolve the moments about the vertical axis giving:

Total Moment about vertical axis ¼ (cid:2)ðFzl þ FzrÞ sin k d sin a cos k

ð2:21Þ

(Compare with Eq. 2.16 for Jacking Moment).

Note that, if “k” is small, cos k ! 1. Equally, by observation of the moment
equations, it may be concluded (because of the double sine terms and small angles)
that the moments will be small. Regardless, from a design perspective, it is best to
conﬁrm magnitudes before deciding whether the values need consideration.

2.8.1.2 Effect of Castor Inclination Angle

From Fig. 2.42, the component of Fzr perpendicular to the plane of the castor angle
is Fzr sin u and when the wheel
the appropriate moment arm is
is turned,
approximately d cos a. Note that the moments at left and right wheel arising from
this geometry oppose each other.

94

2 Steering Systems

For the castor angle, the moment produced by the right hand wheel during a turn is:

Moment about right hand wheel castor axis ¼ (cid:2)Fzr sin u d cos a

ð2:22Þ

(negative because moment at right hand wheel is counter clockwise).
For left hand wheel the moment is clockwise (therefore positive):

Moment about left hand wheel castor axis ¼ þ Fzl sin u d cos a

ð2:23Þ

Total moment about castor axes ¼ Fzl sin u d cos a (cid:2) Fzr sin u d cos a
ð

Þ

ð2:24Þ

where u = castor angle and a = steer angle.

Again, resolving about the vertical axis, the moment becomes:

ð
Total moment about vertical axes ¼ Fzl sin u d cos a (cid:2) Fzr sin u d cos a

Þ cos u

ð2:25Þ

But as “u” is small, cos u ! 1. Equally, observation of the moment terms

shows that the moments oppose each other so the overall effect is minimal.

Example E2-4
A car has a mass of 1200 kg with weight distribution 52% at the front and 48% at
the rear. The car is right hand drive and the driver mass (md) is 100 kg. The
proportion of driver mass distribution on the front axle is two thirds to the front
offside wheel and one third to the nearside wheel, as shown in Fig. E2.4a.

(i) Calculate the torque necessary on both road wheels to hold the wheels at

We have cos u = cos 5 = 0.996 so let it be = 1.
Given left wheel castor to be 5° and right wheel 5.1°, the steering torque from
the difference in the castor angle and wheel loads is then given by Eq. (2.25) as:

The steer angle at which the torque balance occurs is then given by equating the

the castor angle as follows:

(iii) Calculate the distance the vehicle can travel before it deviates laterally
by 1 m (to the edge of the lane) at this steer angle if the vehicle is initially
centred and aligned in a road lane

The lateral deviation may be determined from the geometry of a vehicle trav-

R ¼ 57:3(cid:5)=rad

(cid:6) wheelbase

(cid:6) 2:55 ¼ 107:6 m

For a given angle of travel ðwÞ on the circle, the lateral deviation (Y) is:

Y ¼ R 1 (cid:2) cos w

Þ ¼ 1 m and; as R ¼ 107:6 m, this gives cos w ¼ 0:9907 or

ð
w ¼ 7:82(cid:5)

The longitudinal distance travelled is:

X ¼ R sin w ¼ 107:6 sin 7:82 ¼ 14:64 m

Thus, without steer correction by the driver, the vehicle would leave the lane in

around 14.64 m of travel down the road.

2.8.2 Lateral Force

2.8.2.1 Moment Due to General Offset

Lateral forces produce a self-centring moment because they act at the centre of the
tyre at a distance of r tan u behind the effective centre of rotation deﬁned by the
castor angle as shown in Fig. 2.43. The r tan u term (where r = tyre radius) is often
called the castor trail (or mechanical trail).

Fig. 2.46 Centre of tyre contact patch alters to rear and towards centre of turning radius. This
alters centre of point of action for vertical and lateral forces

The tyre centre of pressure, where the lateral force at the wheel ðFywÞ and
longitudinal force ðFLongÞ are assumed to act, shifts rearward of the wheel centre to
provide an additional trail known as tyre trail or pneumatic trail (PT). Under
braking or tractive effort during cornering, the centre of pressure also shifts away
from the tyre centre by a lateral amount (PL) to create an additional moment
resulting from the tractive or braking effort.

If the pneumatic trail is included, then the equation for the outside wheel

becomes:

Total self (cid:2) centring moment ¼ Fyr þ Fyl

ð

Þ cos u ð2:29Þ

(cid:10)

Note that the effective lateral tyre centre moves inboard on the outer tyre and
outboard on the inner tyre. This produces the situation shown in Fig. 2.46 where the
lateral tyre contact patch moment arm is different for inboard and outboard wheels.
The pneumatic trail may only be determined from test information on a par-
ticular tyre. The tyre is tested on a drum roller rig or a tyre rig with a moving ﬂat
table. The latter runs on a hydrostatic ﬁlm of ﬂuid to reduce friction. Both types of
rig are able to measure the wheel load force, side force (and therefore lateral
dynamic friction ly), slip angle and self-aligning moment in one process—the
wheel load serving as a parameter. It is then possible to calculate the tyre trail for a
range of wheel loads and slip angles. It should be noted that the movement is
dependant of the tyre load so the pneumatic trail positions will differ for the outer
and inner tyres. This will inﬂuence the overall steering “feel” (feedback) during
cornering.

2.8.3 Longitudinal Force—Tractive Effort (Front Wheel

Drive) or Braking

These forces, whether arising from traction (front wheel drive) or braking, act
through the moment arm deﬁned by the swivel axis offset, d, as shown in Fig. 2.47
for a right hand wheel. The longitudinal force Fxr is resolved about the castor axis
to give Fxr cos u:

As shown above, the offset “d” is reduced during steering to be “d cos a” where

“a” is the wheel steer angle. This gives a moment at the right hand wheel as:

Mr ¼ þ Fxr cos u d cos a

ð2:30Þ

This is positive because the moment is clockwise on the right hand wheel. On

the left hand wheel the moment is counter clockwise i.e. negative:

Total Moment ¼ Fxr cos u d cos a (cid:2) Fxr cos u d cos a

ð2:31Þ

If a = 0 this reduces to:

Total Moment ¼ Fxr (cid:2) Fxr

ð

Þ cos u d

ð2:32Þ

Note that the effects at each side tend to cancel each other out but the resulting
overall moment is sensitive to left/right wheel forces. If there is a difference
between these forces then the vehicle will pull to one side during traction/braking.

forces.

2.8.4 Rolling Resistance and Overturning Moments

This acts as shown in Fig. 2.48 and may be resolved into two forces, one normal to
the wheel ðRR sin /Þ and the other along the wheel ðRR cos /Þ where / is the steer
angle.

Note that the lateral pneumatic lateral offset becomes irrelevant.
Compared to the other forces experienced by the wheel, these effects are so small
that they are normally neglected. Typically the adhesion at the tyre/road interface
for braking and tractive effort may be as high as 0.8. The rolling resistance coef-
ﬁcient may be as low as 0.01. As both these forces are a function of wheel load then
the difference is in the order of a factor of 80.

Example E2-5
A front wheel drive car is driven round a right hand bend of 300 m radius at
60 km/h. The front axle torque applied during this manoeuvre is 1200 N m.

The front wheel arrangement is as follows:

Mass acting on front axle (equal load per wheel) 700 kg

105

2.9 Four Wheel Steering (4WS)

Controlling the steering of the rear wheels in addition to the front wheels can have a
signiﬁcant effect on the vehicle handling response. There are two distinct methods
of achieving rear wheel steering: (a) by passive means, relying on the effect of the
lateral forces in combination with suspension compliances, or (b) by active means
in which an actuator controls the rear wheel steer angles. Passive compliance steer
effects are discussed in the next chapter on Suspension Systems and Components
since these effects are an intrinsic part of the suspension design. Active devices are
discussed here since they are linked directly to the steering system design. Various
schemes have been proposed based on mechanical, hydraulic and electrical actu-
ation and the Japanese manufacturers have been particularly keen to market 4WS
vehicles.

The 4WS systems are normally arranged so that, for low speed manoeuvres, the
rear wheels steer in the opposite sense from those at the front. For high speeds, the
rear wheels steer in the same sense as those at the front. At low speeds, manoeu-
vrability is increased by virtue of the reduced turning circle. However, a conse-
quence of 4WS is the increased tendency of the rear of the vehicle to swing
outwards (i.e. the off-tracking effect); this can cause difﬁculties when parking close
to walls, for example. At high speeds, the beneﬁts of in-phase rear steer are better
transient response in, for example, lane change manoeuvres and improved control
of the yaw damping following a transient input.

Advantages of 4WS:

(cid:129) Superior cornering stability.
(cid:129) Improved steering responsiveness and precision.
(cid:129) High speed straight line stability.
(cid:129) Notable improvement in rapid lane-changing manoeuvres.
(cid:129) Smaller turning radius and tight-space manoeuvrability at low speed.

Generally, at low wheel steering angles, the rear wheels are turned in the same
direction as the front wheels whilst, at high wheel steering angles, the rear wheels
are turned in the opposite direction. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2.49. Clearly the
steering characteristic of the rear wheels need to be linked to the characteristic of
the front wheels. If the front wheels are turned through a small angle, the rear
wheels turn a small angle in the same direction. As the angle of the front wheels
progressively increase, the rear wheels are returned to a central position and then
begin to turn in the opposite direction. This characteristic is shown in Fig. 2.50.
Earlier mechanical designs achieved this using a rear steering gearbox which was
mechanically connected to the front steering gear. These systems became more
complex as power assisted steering was introduced but have been simpliﬁed to
some degree with the introduction of electric steering.

2.10 Developments in Steering Assistance—Active

Torque Dynamics

Consider a body mounted on four castor wheels—it is free to move in any planar
direction. If it is desired to steer the body, it would be necessary to ﬁrst control the
direction of one axle (say lateral for the front). Direction is achieved by providing a
longitudinal force at the rear but biased towards one side. This offset force provides
the linear force for forward direction but also a moment to induce steer. In essence
this is the method used to steer and propel a shopping trolley. The front wheels are
ﬁxed (lateral restraint) and the rear wheels are castors. The rear end is moved and
the trolley is then pushed. If a similar principle is applied to a vehicle then “ad-
ditional” steering assistance is possible. For four wheel drive vehicles this may be
achieved in two ways as described below.

2.10.1 Active Yaw Damping

Principally used on four wheel drive vehicles, this system uses the front and rear
differentials to modulate the torque applied to each wheel by locking and unlocking
them dependent on the dynamic situation. As such the system can modulate the
torque provided to each wheel in real time. If the steering system can determine that
a corner is being negotiated then it can allow the vehicle to enter the corner with
necessary rear wheel drive to “push” the vehicle into the corner (as there is less
centrifugal force on the rear wheels). As the vehicle progresses through the corner
then the wheel torque progressively increases to the front wheels so “pulling” it out
of the corner (less centrifugal force on the front wheels). In general terms the torque
is transferred from the rear wheels to the front wheels as it goes round the corner,
the bias split being towards the front wheels as it leaves the corner. This provides
maximum straightening torque as the vehicle leaves the corner so enhancing
stability.

Modulation of torque side to side based on yaw and wheel speed data increases

stability further, particularly on slippery surfaces and emergency situations.

2.10.2 Active Torque Input

This system senses a reduction in steering ability, possibly because of front end
drift. In such a situation, straight ahead drive is increased to one of the rear wheels
which assists cornering ability by correcting the drift. Conversely, during a com-
bined cornering and braking manoeuvre, the braking may be biased to compensate
for detected over or understeer. This method is directly related to input torque
(tractive or braking) to each wheel and so may be referred to as active torque
distribution.

2.11 Concluding Remarks

This chapter has introduced basic topics surrounding the steering of road vehicles.
Particular attention has been paid to the general geometric and kinematic require-
ments in order to be able to control the vehicle in a safe and reliable manner. The
importance of being able to calculate steering wheel loads allowing for both
quasi-static and dynamic manoeuvres has been emphasised. In Chap. 3 we will see
the close connections between the steering and suspension systems, especially for
modern front wheel drive vehicles with very tight packaging constraints.

Developments in steering systems will include more active control and further
enhancements in performance. For example,
regulations provide information
regarding turning circles but not steer angles. In general cars have a wheel steer
angle of around ±35° but this may not provide the manoeuvrability required for
conﬁned parking. The development of 4-wheel steer helps improving such
manoeuvres but it can lead to unnecessary expense if the vehicle is intended only
for urban use. If improved parking is a requirement then increased steer angles is
needed, hence ±65° is normally speciﬁed for taxis. Such needs are being addressed
with concept designs for enhanced urban mobility which suggests a steering angle
of up to ±75° is achievable. This will improve turning and parking manoeuvrability
and will beneﬁt all vehicles during city driving. Figure 2.56 shows such a concept
design for an urban vehicle.

Suspension Systems and Components

Abstract Suspension system design is as much about quality/reﬁnement as being a
handling/safety issue. This chapter begins by considering the kinematic require-
ments of any suspension system before discussing common suspension systems for
both dependant and independent designs. Both front and rear suspension designs
are considered. The chapter continues with a detailed analysis of the suspension
system components—tyres, linkages, springs and d`ampers—the latter including
active damping. It aims to extend the understanding of load transfer when body roll
is considered along with the effects of sprung and unsprung masses. Both anti-squat
and anti-dive designs are also studied. The chapter concludes with a quarter vehicle
analysis whereby body bounce and wheel hop modes are identiﬁed as areas of
interest. The chapter includes many numerical examples to better explain the theory
and demonstrate their application.

3.1

Introduction to Suspension Design

Ride quality and handling are two of the most important issues related to vehicle
reﬁnement. Together they produce some design conﬂicts that have to be resolved by
compromise. Also, the wide range of operating conditions experienced by a vehicle
which affect both ride and handling must be taken into account by the chassis
engineer. This all adds up to some very challenging tasks for the suspension
designer.

While the chassis engineer has a checklist of functional requirements for a given
design, there are also a number of other constraints that have to be met. These
include cost, weight and packaging space limitations, together with requirements
for robustness and reliability, ease of manufacture, assembly and maintenance.

Suspension design like other forms of vehicle design is affected by development
times dictated by market forces. This means that for new vehicles, reﬁned

Suspension Systems and Components

suspensions need to be designed quickly with a minimum of rig and vehicle testing
prior to launch. Consequently, considerable emphasis is placed on computer-aided
design. This requires the use of sophisticated mathematical models and computer
software that enables a variety of “what-if” scenarios to be tested quickly and
avoids the need for a lot of prototype testing.

In order to understand the issues facing the suspension designer it is necessary to

have knowledge of:
(cid:129) The requirements for steering, handling and stability
(cid:129) The ride requirements related to the isolation of the vehicle body from road

irregularities and other sources of vibration and noise

(cid:129) How tyre forces are generated as a result of braking, accelerating and cornering
(cid:129) The needs for body attitude control
(cid:129) Suspension loading and its inﬂuence on the size and strength of suspension

members.

This chapter aims to address the above issues.

3.1.1 The Role of a Vehicle Suspension

The principal requirements for a vehicle suspension are:
(cid:129) To provide good ride and handling performance—this requires the suspension to
have vertical compliance to provide chassis isolation while ensuring that the
wheels follow the road proﬁle with minimum tyre load ﬂuctuation.

(cid:129) To ensure that steering control is maintained during manoeuvring—this requires
the wheels to be maintained in the proper positional attitude with respect to the
road surface.

(cid:129) To ensure that the vehicle responds favourably to control forces produced by the
tyres as a result of longitudinal braking and accelerating forces, lateral cornering
forces and braking and accelerating torques—this requires the suspension
geometry to be designed to resist squat, dive and roll of the vehicle body.
(cid:129) To provide isolation from high frequency vibration arising from tyre excitation
—this requires appropriate isolation in the suspension joints to prevent the
transmission of “road noise” to the vehicle body.

(cid:129) To provide the structural strength necessary to resist the loads imposed on the

suspension.
It will be seen that these requirements are very difﬁcult to achieve simultane-
ously, particularly when the added constraints of cost, packaging space, robustness
and other factors are taken into account. This leads to some design compromises
that often result in less than perfect performance for some of the desired outcomes.

3.1.2 Deﬁnitions and Terminology

There is considerable terminology associated with suspension design that may
appear unfamiliar for engineers in their formative years who are meeting the subject
for the ﬁrst time. Most of this terminology will be described as it arises. A useful
summary of the most common vehicle dynamics deﬁnitions may be found in SAE
670e Vehicle Dynamics Terminology. However care is needed as there are some
differences between American and European terminology.

Figure 3.1 illustrates the SAE 670e whole vehicle reference axes together with
the terms used to describe rotation about these axes. These axes have their origin at
the centre of gravity of the vehicle. Note that other axis systems are sometimes used
in vehicle dynamics analysis.

3.1.3 What Is a Vehicle Suspension?

The isolation of a vehicle body from the road undulations that are fed into the tyre
of a vehicle at the road/wheel interface requires relative movement between the
wheel and the body. This motion is, in general, controlled by some form of linkage
mechanism that incorporates both stiffness and damping. It is this mechanism that is
termed a suspension.

Suspension components, particularly springs and dampers, have a profound
effect on ride and handling performance. In addition to the constraints imposed by
suspension performance requirements, component designers have a range of other
constraints to consider. These include weight, cost, packaging, durability and
maintenance. Because of the hostile environment in which suspension components

operate, and the high ﬂuctuating loads (and hence stresses) involved, fatigue life is
another of the designer’s prime concerns. All suspension systems generally com-
prise the same components—springs, dampers and linkages. Springs are described
in the Sect. 3.4, dampers in Sect. 3.5 and kinematic linkages in Sect. 3.6.

3.1.4 Suspension Classiﬁcations

In general suspensions can be broadly classiﬁed as dependent, independent or semi-
dependent types.

With dependent suspensions the motion of a wheel on one side of the vehicle is
dependent on the motion of its partner on the other side. For example, when a wheel
on one side of an axle strikes a pothole, the effect of it is transmitted directly to its
partner on the other side. Generally this has a detrimental effect on the ride and
handling of the vehicle.

As a result of the trend to greater vehicle reﬁnement, dependent suspensions are
no longer common on passenger cars. However, they are still commonly used on
commercial and off-road vehicles. Their advantages are simple construction and
almost complete elimination of camber change with body roll (resulting in low tyre
wear). Dependent suspensions are also commonly used at the rear of front-wheel
drive light commercial vehicles and on commercial and off-highway vehicles with
rear driven axles (live axles). They are occasionally used in conjunction with
non-driven axles (dead axles) at the front of some commercial vehicles with rear
wheel drive.

With independent suspensions the motion of wheel pairs is independent, so that
a disturbance at one wheel is not directly transmitted to its partner. This leads to
better ride and handling capabilities. This form of suspension usually has beneﬁts in
packaging and gives greater design ﬂexibility when compared to dependent sys-
tems. Some of the most common forms of front and rear independent suspension
designs are considered below. McPherson struts, double wishbones and multi-link
systems are commonly employed for both front and rear wheel applications.
Trailing arm, semi-trailing arm and swing axle systems tend to be used predomi-
nantly for rear wheel applications.

There is also a group of suspensions that fall some way between dependent and
independent suspensions and are consequently called semi-dependent. With this
form of suspension, the rigid connection between pairs of wheels is replaced by a
compliant link. This usually takes the form of a beam that can twist providing both
positional control of the wheel carrier as well as compliance. Such systems tend to
be simple in construction while having scope for design ﬂexibility when used in
conjunction with compliant supporting bushes (elastomer bushes).

3.1 Introduction to Suspension Design

3.1.5 Deﬁning Wheel Position

Since one of the most important functions of a suspension system is to control the
position of the road wheels, it is important to understand the deﬁnitions relating to
wheel location. The location of the wheels relative to both the road and the vehicle
suspension is important and will in general be affected by suspension deﬂection and
tyre loading. In the following sub-sections, parameters relating to wheel position are
deﬁned and their effect on handling behaviour is considered.

3.1.5.1 Camber Angle

This is the angle between the wheel plane and the vertical—taken to be positive
when the wheel leans outwards from the vehicle (Fig. 3.2).

Camber is affected by vehicle loading and by cornering. A slight positive camber
(0.1°) gives more even wear and low rolling resistance. However, on passenger
cars, the setting is often negative (even when the vehicle is empty). Front axle
values range from 0° to −1°20′. Negative camber improves lateral tyre grip on
bends and improves handling because of camber thrust effects (these are a conse-
quence of tyre characteristics).

A disadvantage of an independent suspension is that the wheels incline relative
to the vehicle body on a bend (Fig. 3.3). This tends to produce increased negative
camber on the inner wheels and increased positive camber on the outer wheels.

The outer wheels then try to roll towards the outside of the bend tending to produce
an understeer condition. Note that the change of camber (relative to the road) is a
combination of changes due to suspension movement (rebound on the inside, bump
on the outside) and changes due to body roll.

3.1.5.2 Kingpin Inclination (Steered Axles Only)

Sometimes called swivel pin inclination, kingpin inclination (KPI) is the angle
between the kingpin axis and the vertical (Fig. 3.2). It has the effect of causing the
vehicle to rise when the wheels are turned and produces a noticeable self-centring
effect for KPI’s greater than 15° (see Chap. 2). When the wheels are turned, the
magnitude of the self-aligning moment
is dependent on the kingpin angle,
the kingpin offset and the castor angle. Typical kingpin angles for passenger cars
are between 11° and 15.5°.

The effects of KPI are as follows:

(cid:129) Tyre wear—induced camber changes can create wear particularly at high lock

angles.

(cid:129) Returnability—this is improved with increased values of KPI due to work done

in lifting the vehicle from the straight ahead to the turned position.

(cid:129) Torque steer—this is related to the drive shaft angles.
(cid:129) Lift-off/traction steer on bends—increasing KPI may result in an increased

vehicle reaction to mid-bend traction changes.

(cid:129) Steering effort—KPI causes lift of the vehicle as the steering angle is increased.
This results in an increasing amount of work done at the steering system to
achieve a given wheel angle. However an increase of KPI from zero to 15° is
unlikely to increase the steering effort by more than 10%.

(cid:129) Tyre clearance—changes in KPI affect wheel swept envelope and hence tyre

clearance.

3.1 Introduction to Suspension Design

117

3.1.5.3 Kingpin Offset

Kingpin offset (KPO) is the distance between the centre of the tyre contact patch
and the intersection of the kingpin axis at the ground plane (“d” in Fig. 3.2), taken
to be positive when the intersection point is at the inner side of the wheel. In
practice the KPO varies from small positive to small negative values. For a given
suspension, KPO can be changed by changing tyre width. Increasing KPO
improves the returnability of the steering (see below). The disadvantage is that the
offset provides a moment arm so longitudinal forces at the tyre contact patch due to
braking, or striking a bump or pothole, are transmitted through the steering
mechanism to the steering wheel.

The effects of kingpin offset are thus:

(cid:129) Returnability—positive increases of KPO will increase returnability due to the

increased lift with steering angle.

(cid:129) Brake stability (outboard brakes)—with a diagonal split braking system, nega-
tive KPO will assist in counteracting the steer effect of a failed system. A similar
effect occurs with “split-l” braking where one wheel locks, or with unbalanced
front brakes. For braking on a bend, negative KPO produces toe-in on the outer
wheels creating a tendency to oversteer. With inboard brakes the hub offset (see
below) is the critical dimension.

(cid:129) Torque steer—with a conventional non-biased differential ensuring equal torque
to each shaft, if one wheel loses traction, large values of KPO will cause
steering ﬁght.

(cid:129) Steering effort—it is generally assumed that either positive or negative KPO will
reduce static steering effort by allowing some rolling of the tyre on the road
surface reducing tyre scrub. In practice there appears to be little effect even with
large values of KPO.

3.1.5.4 Kingpin Offset at the Hub

This is deﬁned as the horizontal distance from the kingpin axis to the intersection of
the hub axis and the tyre centreline as indicated in Fig. 3.2. Hub offset is deﬁned as
positive when the tyre centre line lies outside the kingpin axis at hub centre height.

3.1.5.5 Castor Angle

Castor angle is the inclination of the kingpin pin axis projected into the fore-aft
initially through the wheel centre—positive in the direction shown in
plane,
Fig. 3.4. The castor angle produces a self-aligning torque for non-driven wheels. It
is dependent on suspension deﬂection and for steered wheels it inﬂuences the
camber angle as a function of steering angle (see Steering Chap. 2).

Fig. 3.4 Deﬁning castor angle and castor trail

The effects of castor angle are as follows:
Tyre wear—induced camber changes can create shoulder wear particularly at

high lock angles.

Steer response—a positive castor angle will generate negative camber on an

outside wheel thus enhancing turn-in response.

3.1.5.6 Castor Trail

Castor trail, often called mechanical trail, is the longitudinal distance from the point
of intersection of the kingpin axis and the ground to the centre of the tyre contact
patch as shown in Fig. 3.4. It inﬂuences the magnitude of the self-righting moment.
On some front wheel drive cars, there is an increased self-righting moment during
cornering due to the offset of the tractive force and lateral force. This is undesirable
in that the understeer effect is then too great and the steering is unduly inﬂuenced by
rough road surfaces.

The effects of castor trail on vehicle behaviour are as follows:

(cid:129) Straight line stability—improved with higher castor trail.
(cid:129) Returnability—stronger with higher castor trail.
(cid:129) Braking stability—castor angle will generally reduce with braking (due to hub
wind-up and vehicle pitch) resulting in reduced castor trail leading to a degra-
dation in braking stability, i.e. braking stability is enhanced with higher levels of
castor trail.

(cid:129) Steering effort—castor trail has very little effect on steering effort at stationary or
at very low speeds, but otherwise steering effort increases with increasing castor
trail. Steering feel at high lateral accelerations (with impending loss of grip) is
also inﬂuenced by castor trail.

3.1 Introduction to Suspension Design

119

3.1.5.7 Castor Offset at the Hub

Castor offset at the hub is the longitudinal distance from the vertical centre line
through the wheel centre to the intersection of the longitudinal axis through the
wheel centre and the kingpin axis. It is positive when in front of the wheel centre as
shown in Fig. 3.4. It is possible to use a negative offset to reduce mechanical trail
and self-centring force felt at the steering wheel.

3.1.5.8 Toe-in/Toe-Out

This is the difference between the front and rear distances separating the centre
plane of a pair of wheels (quoted at static ride height and measured to the inner rims
of the wheels). Toe-in is when the wheel centre planes converge towards the front
of the vehicle as shown in Fig. 3.5. Braking and rolling resistance forces tend to
produce a toe-out effect, while tractive forces (front wheel drive vehicles) tend to
produce the opposite effect. This leads to front wheels being set to toe-in for both
non-driven and driven front axles. In the latter front wheel drive case, this is to
ensure driving stability when the driver suddenly takes his foot off the accelerator.
With independent front suspensions, body roll can produce changes of toe and
hence roll steer. This is discussed in the Steering chapter.

3.1.6 Tyre Loads

Suspension loads result from the set of forces and moments that are generated at the
tyre/road interface during vehicle motion. These forces depend on the static loads
produced by masses of the vehicle, occupants and payload, together with the
dynamic forces arising from accelerating, braking, cornering, tyre rolling resistance
and aerodynamic effects. These combined tyre forces affect the handling ability of
the vehicle and it is the chassis designer’s task to ensure that their effects are
satisfactorily controlled.

3.1.6.1 Tyre Contact Patch

Due to tyre compliance, the tyres deform to produce a contact area over which tyre
load is distributed. This is called the tyre contact patch. For static loading condi-
tions, this is a symmetrical area as shown in Fig. 3.6a. The centre of pressure in this
case lies vertically below the axle centre. During motion of the vehicle, the tyre
contact patch becomes distorted depending on whether the vehicle is accelerating,
braking, cornering etc. These actions produce a distributed set of normal and shear
forces in the tyre contact patch. It is these shear forces, and the compressive/tensile
shear deﬂections across the interface, that cause the tyre to “creep” in the direction
of the force, this “creep” generally being referred to as tyre slip.

3.1.6.2 Vertical Forces

Under static conditions, the load distribution in a vehicle determines the vertical
load supported by each wheel. These forces are altered under dynamic conditions
(acceleration, braking and cornering) by load transfer effects as described in
Chap. 1. During acceleration the vertical load increases on the rear wheels and
decreases on the front wheels. The reverse happens during braking. During
cornering there are lateral (centrifugal force) forces exerted on the vehicle through
its mass centres. Since these lie above the ground plane, they increase the vertical
load at the outer wheels and decrease them at the inner wheels.

Aerodynamic forces also affect the vertical tyre loads. When the vehicle is
moving forward the aerodynamic drag forces always increase the rear wheel
loading and reduce the front wheel loading. These forces become signiﬁcant for
passenger car speeds above about 80 km/h and are dependent on vehicle type and
body design. Since the aerodynamic forces acting on a vehicle are above the ground

3.1 Introduction to Suspension Design

121

plane, they produce moments that cause pitch and roll. These in turn produce load
transfer and hence affect tyre loading.

3.1.6.3 Longitudinal Tyre Forces

Longitudinal tyre forces are produced by braking and accelerating, rolling resis-
tance and aerodynamic forces. They are affected by both wheel-slip and vertical
loading.

3.1.6.4 Lateral Force and Slip Angle

As a result of the cornering force described above, there is also a shear force
produced in the plane of the tyre contact patch. This produces distortion of the
contact patch resulting in the direction of wheel motion differing from the wheel
heading by an angle called the slip angle. Figure 3.6b shows this for the case of a
non-steered wheel. This clearly has implications for directional control and han-
dling stability of a vehicle. Aerodynamic forces and camber angle also affect lateral
tyre forces.

3.1.6.5 Pneumatic Trail and Self-Aligning Moment

As a result of distortion of the tyre contact patch, the resultant lateral tyre force Fy
acts at a distance tp (termed the pneumatic trail), behind the vertical centre line
through the wheel centre (Fig. 3.6b). This produces a self-aligning moment, Mz, of
magnitude tpFy about an axis normal to the road surface.

3.1.6.6 Vertical Tyre Stiffness or Tyre Spring Rate

The vertical stiffness of a tyre is closely proportional to the applied vertical load and
is generally dependent on the following:
(cid:129) Size
(cid:129) Construction
(cid:129) Inﬂation pressure
(cid:129) Camber
(cid:129) Temperature
(cid:129) Speed of rotation
(cid:129) Lateral and longitudinal forces.

122

3 Suspension Systems and Components

It is generally accepted that 90% of the tyre stiffness is related to inﬂation
pressure. It is clear from the above listed variables that stiffness is a dynamic and
hence variable quantity. So tyre manufacturers will not supply a given stiffness
value but will provide dynamic rolling radius and circumference data at various
speeds, loads, pressures and camber angles. From the given information, the chassis
engineer will be in a position to calculate ride heights and gearing for a range of
operation conditions.

A ﬁrst order estimate of tyre vertical stiffness may be determined by measuring
the rolling radius to establish the tyre deﬂection under load. A ﬁrst order estimate
for stiffness is the tyre load/deﬂection ratio. If the length of the contact patch is
known then the rolling radius and tyre vertical deﬂection may be calculated to give
the vertical stiffness. It should be noted that the contact patch comprises both the
pressurised semi-rigid core, which supports the majority of the load, and the rela-
tively soft rubber contact area which provides the grip or adhesion.

3.2 Selection of Vehicle Suspensions

In this section the factors that inﬂuence the selection of suspension types are
examined. The kinematic requirements for suspensions and a range of suspension
conﬁgurations are also discussed.

Having selected a suspension mechanism for a given vehicle a number of issues
need to be considered. These include how the wheel movement changes relative to
both the vehicle body and the road surface over the range of suspension travel and
whether the suspension members are able to cope with the variety of loads imposed
on them. Of particular concern are changes in camber and toe angles together with
changes in track width (this is related to tyre scrub and hence tyre wear). The
loading in some suspension mechanisms produces a need for additional support
members. In general these do not affect the kinematic behaviour of the suspension
mechanism.

Initially, it is assumed that suspension mechanisms undergo rigid body motion
with no compliance at the joints between members. However, most modern sus-
pensions do incorporate some compliance at certain joints to facilitate subtle wheel/
body movements such as compliance steer to enhance handling performance. Also,
it
the motion of the wheel relative to the body is
2-dimensional, i.e. it occurs in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the
vehicle. In reality, because of additional design requirements, e.g. pitch control of
the vehicle body, the wheel motion needs to be 3-dimensional.

is assumed initially that

The complexity of the issues facing the chassis designer can be appreciated
when one also considers how various operational factors affect chassis performance
as outlined below.

3.2 Selection of Vehicle Suspensions

123

3.2.1 Factors Inﬂuencing Suspension Selection

Choice of suspension is primarily determined by the engine-drive combination,
which is in turn determined by the following:
(cid:129) The functional requirements of the vehicle (use, performance capabilities and

(cid:129) The need to place a high proportion of the vehicle mass over the driven axles to

cargo space).

aid traction.

The most common combinations are outlined as follows.

3.2.1.1 Front Mounted Engine and Rear Wheel Drive

In this case there is not the same restriction on engine length as there is with the
front engine, front wheel drive combination. For this reason this conﬁguration is
adopted for more powerful passenger cars and estate cars. Under full load most of
the vehicle mass is on the driven axle. However, when lightly loaded, e.g. only
driver and passenger (the 2-up condition), this conﬁguration leads to poor traction
on wet and wintry roads, a problem that can be overcome with the use of traction
control.

With this conﬁguration, the implications for the choice of a rear suspension are
that it has to accommodate the differential and drive shafts while still providing an
acceptable boot space.

3.2.1.2 Front Mounted Engine and Front Wheel Drive

In this case the engine and transmission form one unit which sits in front of, over, or
just behind the front axle. This leads to a very compact arrangement compared to
the previous case and this is no doubt responsible for its almost universal adoption
on small to medium sized saloons (up to 2 litre capacity). The main advantages
include a signiﬁcant load on the driven and steered wheels for normal vehicle loads
providing good traction and road holding on wet and icy roads. With a fully laden
vehicle this advantage tends to be lost as the centre of gravity is then further to the
rear.

The implications for front suspension design are that provision must be made for
drive shafts and steering gear. In general the packaging space for the suspension is
limited by the size of the engine-transmission unit. This engine-drive conﬁguration
favours McPherson strut and double wishbone types of suspensions at the front.
A variety of rear suspensions are possible for this drive conﬁguration. The type of
vehicle and the degree of reﬁnement required usually inﬂuence the choice.

124

3 Suspension Systems and Components

3.2.1.3 Four Wheel Drive

In this case it is possible to have all the wheels driven continuously or to have one
of the pair of wheels always connected to the engine while the other pair are
selected manually or automatically as required. The aim is of course to improve
traction for all road conditions especially wet and wintry conditions. All wheel
drive is particularly advantageous for off-road conditions and for improving
climbing ability regardless of loading conditions.

From the point of view of suspension selection, the requirements for the front
suspension are similar to that on a vehicle with front mounted engine and front
wheel drive. The rear suspension requirement is similar to that for a rear suspension
on a vehicle with a front mounted engine and rear wheel drive.

Suspensions have been broadly categorised in Sect. 3.1.4 as dependent, inde-
pendent or semi-dependent. Solid axles have been categorised as dependent sys-
tems. However, other connections across the vehicle, such as anti-roll bars, are not
classed as dependent because, although they inﬂuence suspension forces across an
axle, they do not provide a geometric constraint.

3.2.1.4 Other Factors

The mass of the components associated with the wheel hub, brake components
(outboard brakes), and parts of the other masses connected to the wheel hub, e.g.
suspension links, suspension spring and damper, create what is known as the un-
sprung mass. This produces an additional resonant frequency when the vehicle
system is subjected to road induced vibration (a 2 degree of freedom system). The
effect is to increase the dynamic tyre load and cause degradation in ride comfort.
The aim should therefore be to keep the unsprung mass to a minimum.

Another factor to be considered is the roll centre (and hence roll axis) location.
This affects such things as the amount of body roll in cornering, the amount of
lateral load transfer and the loads in the suspension links. There is a roll centre in
the vertical
transverse plane passing through each axle. Suspension type and
geometry determine its location. Some suspension types allow much greater ﬂex-
ibility in the choice of roll centre location. This is discussed in detail in Sect. 3.8
below.

3.3 Kinematic Requirements for Dependent

and Independent Suspensions

The main objective in suspension design is to isolate the vehicle body from road
surface undulations. Ideally, this requires that the wheels of the vehicle perfectly
follow the road surface undulations with no vertical movement of the vehicle body.

In analysing this scenario, it is possible to assume that the vehicle body is stationary
while we consider the motion of the wheels.

The motion requirements of the wheels relative to the vehicle body can be
satisﬁed in a number of different ways. If each wheel can move independently of its
partner on the other side of the vehicle (i.e. an independent suspension, as deﬁned
in Sect. 3.1.4), this can be achieved kinematically as shown in Fig. 3.7. In the ﬁrst
example (Fig. 3.7a), the wheel moves vertically relative to the vehicle body via a
sliding contact system. In the second example (Fig. 3.7b), the required vertical
motion is accompanied by rotation about a pivot attached to the body, while in the
third example (Fig. 3.7c), the wheel and hub are attached to one of the links in a
4-bar mechanism. This provides the required vertical wheel movement accompa-
nied by a small rotation. All of these examples have some practical disadvantages as
discussed below when applications are considered.

In an independent suspension the mechanism coupling the wheel to the body of
the vehicle is said to have a single degree of freedom, i.e. the motion of the wheel
relative the body can be described by a single coordinate. If it is necessary to couple
a pair of wheels together on a single axle (as in a dependent suspension), the
mechanism required must have two degrees of freedom to allow vertical movement
of each wheel while at the same time having a near rigid connection between the
two wheels. A practical example of how this can be achieved is shown in Fig. 3.8.

3.3.1 Examples of Dependent Suspensions

Axles may be categorised into two sub-groups:
(cid:129) Drive axles—sometimes called “live” axles—in which solid axles carry the

driven wheels and differential.

allows rotation but prevents lateral movement of the axle

(cid:129) Non-driven axles—usually called “dead” axles—in which a solid beam simply

connects the two none driven wheels which may be steerable.

Solid axles are rarely used in modern passenger vehicle designs. They are
however almost universally used for trucks and commercial vehicles and for many
off-highway vehicles because of their simplicity (relative to independent systems).
They virtually eliminate wheel camber (except for the small amount arising from
different tyre deﬂections on the inner and outer wheels) and wheel alignment is easy
to maintain, providing good tyre wear properties.

Many methods of mounting solid axles using dependent suspension systems
have been and are still used in vehicle design. Only the main types and associated
principles are covered here.

3.3.1.1 Hotchkiss Drive

this is known as the Hotchkiss arrangement (Fig. 3.9). It

The most familiar form of mounting a solid drive axle is on a pair of semi-elliptic
leaf springs;
is a
remarkably simple suspension and produces satisfactory location of the wheels with
the minimum number of components. Its simplicity derives from the leaf spring
properties, i.e. compliant in the vertical direction but relatively stiff laterally and
longitudinally.

Developments in leaf springs over the years have overcome problems with
inter-leaf friction. Single and taper leaf designs now tend to be used. However, for
the low spring rates required for good ride performance, single leaf springs are
generally inadequate to resist lateral loads and driving and braking torques on
modern vehicles. In such cases, additional strengthening links such as Panhard rods
are used as indicated in Fig. 3.8. These Panhard rods constrain movement back to
the chassis and inhibits spring wind-up (the spring adopting an “S” shape due to
wheel input torque) which results in wheel hopping.

The detailed design of the leaf spring itself and the associated shackle mounting
geometry (Fig. 3.9) which accommodates changes in effective spring length is not
straightforward. Design guidelines are published in the SAE Spring Design Manual.

3.3.1.2 Four-Link Arrangements

The requirements for a solid axle to have two degrees of freedom and also withstand
all types of loading can be satisﬁed by a number of four-link suspension mechanisms.
In the mechanism shown in Fig. 3.10, two upper and two lower links—usually
trailing (but not always)—react the driving/braking torques while providing the
required vertical and roll degrees of freedom. Lateral control may be provided by

angling the upper links (as shown in Fig. 3.10), triangulating the upper links, or by
providing an additional Panhard rod. Any springing medium can be used, but coil
or air springs are the most common. The advantages of this suspension design over
the Hotchkiss arrangement are greater design ﬂexibility in arranging the roll centre,
the anti-dive/squat geometry and controlling roll steer.

3.3.2 Examples of Independent Front Suspensions

Almost all passenger cars, and increasing numbers of light trucks, use independent
suspensions at the front. The gradual shift towards independent suspensions has
resulted from their beneﬁts in packaging, especially for front wheel drive vehicles
where they are better able to ﬁt into the limited space available around the engine/
transmission system. They also permit greater suspension design ﬂexibility and
overcome problems of steering shimmy vibrations often associated with beam axle
designs. Over the years a bewildering number of independent suspension designs
have been proposed and the descriptions here are restricted to the generic types.

3.3.2.1 McPherson Strut Suspensions

Great simplicity is the main beneﬁt of this design with the wheel controlled by a
lower control arm in combination with the McPherson sliding strut (Fig. 3.11). The
conﬁguration shown in Fig. 3.11 is well able to withstand the longitudinal and
lateral loads that will arise for various operating conditions. Advantages of the
design are good packaging and simplicity, whilst its disadvantages are a high
installation height (which may conﬂict with the bonnet line) and wheel loads that
produce a moment which must be reacted by the McPherson strut. This moment
may cause friction problems in the strut. Angling the axis of the spring relative to
the strut axis can reduce this problem. Note connection of strut to anti-roll bar in
the example shown in Fig. 3.11.

3.3.2.2 Wishbone Suspensions

Upper and lower wishbones (or arms as they are called in the United States) are
combined to form a classic four-bar linkage mechanism when viewed from the
front. Figures 3.7c and 3.12 show typical double wishbone arrangements. The
wishbones are nearly always unequal in length with the upper arm being invariably
shorter than the lower one to meet the space limitations in front-engine vehicles
(Fig. 3.12).

3.3.2.3 Multilink Designs

Multi-link suspensions are now a common feature on passenger cars from
mid-range models upward. They are usually based on three, four, or ﬁve links per
wheel station and are designed to give more complete control over wheel posi-
tioning. This comes at a price due to the added number of components, and the
extra effort required in setting them up. The front suspension of a ﬁve link design as

130

shown in Fig. 3.13 is typical of such designs. Because of the number of links (5 in
this case), the suspension mechanism is over-constrained kinematically. Suspension
movement is only possible because of compliant suspension bushes at the ends of
some of the links. As such the wheel tends to orbit about the kingpin axis during
steer in addition to rolling.

3.3.3 Examples of Independent Rear Suspensions

Differences in rear suspension design are dictated by whether the axle is driven or
non-driven. In the case of rear wheel drive, one must consider the packaging space
(effected by both differential and a need to minimise intrusion into the boot space)
and also torque-steer effects. This latter point is particularly relevant for larger,
more powerful, saloon cars. Some examples are discussed below.

3.3.3.1 Trailing Arm Suspension

A simple single trailing arm (Fig. 3.14) can be used with a torsion bar spring or
with a rubber or hydro-elastic one. With this design the wheel camber is the same as
the body roll angle.

3.3.3.2 Swing Axle Suspension

This is also a simple way of achieving an independent rear suspension (Fig. 3.15).
The length of the swing axle controls the camber behaviour but this has to be
relatively short to accommodate the differential. Camber changes (and consequently
scrub) are signiﬁcant during normal wheel travel. Also this design is particularly
prone to the problem of jacking (vertical movement of the vehicle) and is little used
nowadays.

3.3.3.3 Semi-trailing Arm Systems

This design is a cross between a pure trailing arm and a swing axle (Fig. 3.16). The
additional ﬂexibility in the design allows a compromise in the control of camber
and jacking. However care must be taken with the geometry to control the amount
of steer which results from the inclination of the pivot axis. More recent variants of
this type of design try to exploit small amounts of rear steering to improve overall
vehicle handling qualities.

3.3.4 Examples of Semi-independent Rear Suspensions

3.3.4.1 De Dion System

In this suspension design the drive is separated from the solid axle (Fig. 3.17).
Hence, the differential is chassis mounted and the simple axle is typically located by
one of many four-link variations.

The De Dion suspension makes use of universal joints at both the wheel hubs
and the differential and uses a tubular beam to hold the wheels in parallel. The De
Dion tube is not directly connected to the chassis or designed to ﬂex so does not act
as an anti-roll bar. Its main advantage is that the unsprung mass is reduced dra-
matically compared with a live axle. Additionally there are camber changes during
axle bounce or rebound due to the Watt linkage mechanism. With zero camber
settings on both wheels, good traction is obtained with wide tyres and wheel
hopping is reduced at high power inputs. However, the De Dion suspension does
not have signiﬁcant cost or performance advantages over a fully independent
system and hence is generally less used these days.

3.3.4.2 Trailing Twist Axle System

This arrangement has become common at the rear of small front wheel drive
vehicles due to its relative simplicity and low cost. It is a cross between a fully
independent trailing arm arrangement and a dependent beam axle arrangement. The
axle is replaced by a crossbeam that is allowed to twist by an amount controlled by
the geometry of the suspension and the structural properties of all the members.

An example is shown in Fig. 3.18. Such designs are known by various names,
trailing twist-axle and semi-dependent suspensions. The cross member is

effectively rigid in bending but has torsional compliance and this performs a
function similar to that of an anti-roll bar.

The support bushes can be angled and designed to have a different stiffness
along and perpendicular to their respective principal axes (Fig. 3.19). This can
produce a shear centre behind the wheel axis to give a compliance steer in the
correct direction consistent with understeer.

The shape of the open section cross-member can be varied to alter the position of
its shear centre (a feature of open sectioned members in torsion, typically rolled
channel section). This permits some ﬂexibility in the choice of roll centre location
as discussed in Sect. 3.8 below.

3.4 Springs

Suspension systems require a variety of compliances to ensure good ride, handling
and NVH performance. The need for compliance between the unsprung and sprung
masses in order to provide good vibration isolation has long been recognised. In
essence, a suspension spring ﬁtted between the wheel and body of a vehicle allows
the wheel to move up and down with the road surface undulations without causing
similar movements of the body. For good isolation of the body (and hence good
ride), the springs should be as soft as possible consistent with providing uniform
tyre loading in order to ensure satisfactory handling performance.

The relatively soft springing required for ride requirements is normally inade-
quate for resisting body roll in cornering; therefore it is usual for a suspension
system to also include additional roll stiffening in the form of anti-roll bars.
Furthermore, there is the possibility of the suspension hitting its limits of travel as a
result of abnormal ground inputs (e.g. as a result of striking a pothole). It is then
necessary to ensure that a minimum of shock loading is transmitted to the sprung
mass. This requires the use of additional springs in the form of bump stops to
decelerate the suspension at its limits of travel.

Finally, there is also a requirement to prevent the transmission of high frequency
vibration (>20 Hz) from the road surface via the suspension to connection points on

3.4 Springs

135

the chassis. This is achieved by using rubber bush connections (elastomeric com-
ponents) between suspension members—see Steering chapter.

The following compliant elements are thus required in suspension systems:
suspension springs, anti-roll bars, bump-stops and rubber bushes. In this section
attention is concentrated on suspension springs and anti-roll bars.

3.4.1 Spring Types and Characteristics

The main types of suspension spring are:
(cid:129) Steel springs (leaf springs, coil springs and torsion bars)
(cid:129) Hydro-pneumatic springs
(cid:129) Air bag springs.

3.4.1.1 Leaf Springs

Sometimes called semi-elliptic springs, these have been used since the earliest
developments in motor vehicle technology. They rely on beam bending principles
to provide their compliance and are a simple and robust form of suspension spring
still widely used in heavy commercial applications such as lorries and vans. In some
suspensions (e.g. the Hotchkiss type) they are used to provide both vertical com-
pliance and lateral constraint for the wheel travel. Size and weight are among their
disadvantages.

Leaf springs can be of single or multi-leaf construction. In the latter case
(Fig. 3.20) interleaf friction can affect their performance and this can be reduced
with the use of interleaf plastic inserts. Rebound clips are used to bind the leaves
together for rebound motion. The swinging shackle accommodates the change in
length of the spring produced by bump loading. The main leaf of the spring is
formed at each end into an eye shape and attached to the sprung mass via rubber
bushes. Suspension travel is limited by a rubber bump stop attached to the central
rebound clip. Structurally, leaf springs are designed to produce constant stress along
their length when loaded.

Spring loading can be determined by considering the forces (see Sect. 3.10)
acting on the spring and shackle as a result of wheel loading (Fig. 3.21a). The
spring is a three force member with FA, FW and FC acting at A, B and C respec-
tively. The wheel load FW, is vertical and the direction of FC is parallel to the
shackle (a two-force member). The direction of FA must pass through the inter-
section of the forces FW and FC (point P) for the link to be in equilibrium. Knowing
the magnitude of the wheel load enables the other two forces to be determined. The
number, length, width and thickness of the leaves determine the stiffness (rate) of
the spring. Angling of the shackle link can be used to give a variable rate. When the
angle h°< 90° (Fig. 3.21), the spring rate will increase (i.e. have a rising rate) with
bump loading.

3.4.1.2 Helical Coil Springs

This type of spring shown in Fig. 3.22 provides a light and compact form of com-
pliance that is an important feature in terms of weight and packaging constraints. It
requires little maintenance and provides the opportunity for co-axial mounting with a
damper. Its disadvantages are that because of low levels of structural damping, there
is a possibility of surging (resonance along the length of coils) and the spring as a
whole does not provide any lateral support for guiding the wheel motion.

Most suspension coil springs are of the open coil variety (helix angle greater
than 15°). This means that the coil cross-sections are subjected to a combination of
torsion, bending and shear loads as shown in Fig. 3.23. Spring rate is related to the
wire and coil diameters, the number of coils and the shear modulus of the spring
material. Cylindrical springs with a uniform pitch produce a linear rate. Variable
rate springs are produced by varying either the coil diameter (conical types) and/or
the pitch of the coils along their length. In the case of variable pitch springs, the
coils are designed to progressively “bottom-out” as the spring is loaded, the shorter
pitch coils making contact ﬁrst. The number of working coils are progressively

reduced thereby increasing stiffness with load. It would not be common for a coil
spring to be fully compressed (all coils touching) as this distorts the coils, increases
stresses and reduces spring life.

number of active coils, “n”.

3.4.1.3 Hydro-Pneumatic Springs

In this case the spring effect is produced by compressing a constant mass of gas
(typically nitrogen) in a variable volume enclosure. The principle of operation of a
basic diaphragm accumulator spring is shown in Fig. 3.26. As the wheel deﬂects in
bump, the piston moves upwards transmitting the motion to the ﬂuid and com-
pressing the gas via the ﬂexible diaphragm. The gas pressure increases as its vol-
ume decreases to produce a hardening spring characteristic.

The principle was exploited in the Moulton-Dunlop hydro-gas suspension where
damping was incorporated in the hydro-pneumatic units. Front and rear units were
connected to give pitch control. A further development of the principle has been the
system developed by Citroen. This incorporates a hydraulic pump to supply pres-
surised ﬂuid to four hydro-pneumatic struts (one at each wheel-station). Height
correction of the vehicle body is achieved with regulator valves that are adjusted by
roll-bar movement or manual adjustment by the driver.

In general, hydro-pneumatic systems are complex (and expensive) and mainte-
nance can also be a problem in the long term. Their cost can, however, be offset by
good performance. Patents cover the two systems discussed above, but there is still
scope for development of alternative hydro-pneumatic systems. Some of these
concepts are incorporated into controllable “active” suspensions.

Figure 3.27 shows a typical suspension as used on many heavy duty vehicles,
including trailers, and Fig. 3.28 shows a diagrammatic representation of a rolling
seal air-cushion. The air bag is totally enclosed by a rolling diaphragm type seal and
is provided by air pressure from the vehicle on-board compressor via storage
reservoirs. The maximum operating pressure is in the region of 2–5 bar dependant
on vehicle load during a severe bump before the stops are engaged.

The distances L1 to L2 in Fig. 3.28 give the wheel to suspension ratio, some-

times referred to as the transmission ratio.

With such systems (requiring pressurised air), it would be possible to vary the
supply pressure from side to side to counter vehicle roll and possible roll-over. In
addition fore to aft pressure could be controlled to reduce vehicle pitch during
braking/acceleration.

3.4.2 Anti-roll Bars (Roll Stabilisers)

Anti-roll bars (ARB’s) are a very simple type of spring and consequently very
cheap to manufacture. In essence the design consists of a bar loaded in torsion when
the two wheels connected by the ARB deﬂect by differing amounts. As such a
torsion bar is both wear and maintenance free. Despite their simplicity they cannot
easily be adopted for some of the more popular forms of suspension.

ARB’s are used to reduce body roll and have an inﬂuence on a vehicle’s
cornering characteristics (in terms of understeer and oversteer). They do not con-
tribute to overall suspension stiffness if both wheels bump/rebound the same
amount. Figure 3.29a shows how a typical roll bar is connected to a pair of wheels.
The ends of the U-shaped bar are connected to the wheel supports and the central
length of the bar is attached to the body of the vehicle. Attachment points need to be
selected to ensure that bar is subjected to torsional loading without bending.

If one of the wheels is lifted relative to the other, half the total anti-roll stiffness
acts downwards on the wheel and the reaction on the vehicle body tends to resist

body roll. If both wheels are lifted by the same amount, the bar does not twist and
there is no transfer of load to the vehicle body. If the displacements of the wheels
are mutually opposed (one wheel up and the other down by the same amount), the
full effect of the anti-roll stiffness is produced.

Roll stiffness is equal to the rate of change of roll moment with roll angle.
Figure 3.29b shows the contributions to the total roll moment made by suspension
stiffness and anti-roll bar stiffness.

The anti-roll bar as shown in Fig. 3.30 is an adaptation of the simple torsion bar.
In this design the total bar construction would be of the same section to reduce
costs. As such the torque arm section of the bar will be subject to bending which
should be included in calculation of total stiffness.

The principle of operation of any ARB (Fig. 3.31) is to convert the applied
wheel load FW into a torque FW (cid:2) R producing twist in the twist section of the bar.
A circular cross-section bar gives the lowest spring weight for a given stiffness and
may be solid or tubular. In this case simple torsion of shaft theory can be used to
determine the stiffness of the bar and the stresses within it. In general, stiffness is

related to diameter and length of the torsion bar and the shear modulus of the
material. The torque arm (of length R as shown in Fig. 3.31) should be relatively
stiff in comparison to the torsion section and may sometimes be neglected in
stiffness calculations. A bending moment FW (cid:2) L is also induced in the twist
section of the member and supports should be positioned to minimise this. As the
torque arm rotates under load, the moment arm changes, requiring twist angle
corrections (for large rotations) to be made in design calculations.

3.5 Dampers

3.5.1 Damper Types and Characteristics

Frequently called shock absorbers, dampers are the main energy dissipaters in a
vehicle suspension. They are required to dampen vibration after a wheel strikes a
pot-hole or similar. In addition they provide a good compromise between low
sprung mass acceleration (related to ride) and adequate control of the unsprung
mass to provide good road holding.

Suspension dampers are usually telescopic devices containing hydraulic ﬂuid.
They are connected between the sprung and unsprung masses and produce a
damping force that is proportional to the relative velocity across their ends. The
features of the two most common types of passive damper are shown in Fig. 3.32.
Figure 3.32a shows a dual tube damper in which the inner tube is the working
cylinder while the outer cylinder is used as a ﬂuid reservoir. The latter is necessary
to store the surplus ﬂuid that results from a difference in volumes on either side of
the piston. This is a result of the variable rod volume in the inner tube.

In the monotube damper shown in Fig. 3.32b, the surplus ﬂuid is accommodated
by a gas-pressurised free piston. An alternative form of monotube damper (not
shown in Fig. 3.32) uses a gas/liquid mixture as the working ﬂuid to absorb the
volume differences.

Comparing the two types of damper shown in Fig. 3.32, the dual tube design
offers better protection against stones thrown up by the wheels and is also a shorter
unit making it easier to package. On the other hand, the monotube strut dissipates
heat more readily.

In dealing with road surface undulations in the bump direction (the damper in
compression), relatively low levels of damping are required when compared with
the rebound motion (the damper extended). This is because the damping force
produced in bump tends to aid the acceleration of the sprung mass, while in
rebound an increased level of damping is required to dissipate the energy stored in
the suspension spring. These requirements lead to damper characteristics that are
asymmetrical when plotted on force-velocity axes (Fig. 3.33). The damping rate (or
coefﬁcient) is the slope of the characteristic. Ratios of 3:1 for rebound to bump are
quite common.

The characteristics called for in damper designs are achieved by a combination
of oriﬁce ﬂow and ﬂows through spring-loaded one-way valves. These provide
plenty of scope for shaping and ﬁne-tuning of damper characteristics. Figure 3.34
shows the principle of the combined oriﬁce and valve control system and Fig. 3.35
the resultant characteristic. Bump and rebound would have different valves. At low
relative velocities, damping is by oriﬁce control until the ﬂuid pressure is sufﬁcient
to open the pre-loaded ﬂow-control valves. Hence the shape of the combined
characteristic shown in Fig. 3.35. The problem with the design as shown in
Fig. 3.34 is that by using a sphere in the cut-off valve the operation of the valve
tends to be either open or closed (on/off).

A driver-operated adjustment mechanism can be used to obtain several damping
characteristics from one unit. Typical curves for a three position adjustable damper are
shown in Fig. 3.36. A continuous electronically controlled adjustment forms the basis
of one type of controllable suspension designed to improve both ride and handling.

3.5.2 Active Dampers

3.5.2.1 Variable Resistance Designs

The general principle is to have a 2-setting valve. In one position the oriﬁce is small
and so the suspension is “ﬁrm”. If a bypass is employed (a larger oriﬁce is opened
alongside the small oriﬁce) then the oriﬁce resistance reduces and the suspension is
“soft”. The one-way valve remains the same and so its characteristic (slope) remains
unchanged. In such a case, only 2 settings are possible. The modiﬁed system is
indicated simply in Fig. 3.37 and the characteristics are shown in Fig. 3.38.

To obtain more settings, a second valve is used which then gives 4 settings, ﬁrm,
medium, soft and extreme soft. With the 2-setting valve the ratio of damping
between bounce and rebound is dependent on the cylinder and rod dimensions.
There is an additional relief valve that gives the “slope” of the characteristic.

An additional feature of more recent designs is to control the valve opening
using a needle valve. Using this modiﬁcation of
the
force-velocity characteristics may be shaped by altering the needle design (taper
and shape) giving more control of ﬂow. A further advance would be to also provide
for a variable spring preload and so control when the valve lifts. In these advanced
designs a solenoid is used to adjust the spring preload, the rate being controlled by
the current supply. This allows the valve to be opened progressively (rather than on/
off) and so change the overall characteristics. The modiﬁed basic principle is shown
in Fig. 3.39 and the characteristics in Fig. 3.40.

Such a damping system may be referred to as Continuous Damping Control
(CDC) and a typical modern system is shown in Fig. 3.41 along with the internal
the
valve arrangement. The solenoid indicated progressively opens the valve,

valve is shown in Fig. 3.42.

If independent control of bounce and rebound is required then 2 proportional

valves can be used, one each for bounce and rebound as shown in Fig. 3.43.

3.5.2.2 The Use of Rheological Fluids: Variable Viscosity Technology

Two types of rheologically-active ﬂuid are used to give variable damping:
(cid:129) Magneto-reheological (MR) ﬂuid
(cid:129) Electro-rheological (ER) ﬂuid.

Magneto-rheological ﬂuid contain a mixture of iron particles in the damper oil.
The “valve” is just an electromagnetic solenoid itself, located at the piston, which
has holes to connect the lower with the upper working chamber through which the
oil ﬂows as shown in Fig. 3.44. A magnetic ﬁeld is generated around the valve, its
strength changing the orientation of the iron particles within the valve area. This in
turn changes the viscosity of the ﬂuid and therefore the ﬂow through the valve
holes. The effect increases the resistance of ﬂow and generates a pressure change
inside the active (compressed) chamber of the damper. The viscosity of the ﬂuid
inside the working chamber is not changed and keeps the same physical com-
pressibility characteristics.

Electro-rheological ﬂuid works

to the
in a
magneto-rheological ﬂuid. In this case the ﬂuid is based on a silicon oil ﬂuid
containing particles of an electro-active polymer. An electric ﬁeld is applied and
this generates an effect similar to that in a magneto-rheological ﬂuid. Because of the
required high voltages of 1–2 kV and the challenges of isolation, this principle has
not yet been used in series car applications.

similar principle

very

Both MR and ER principles are limited to mono-tube applications because of the
restrictions of the ﬂuids themselves which are similar to each other in this regard.

analysis (since forces are excluded). This means that bush compliances cannot be
included. Hence the suspension must be treated as if all the link connections are
perfect pivots, sliders or ball joints.

A kinematic analysis of a proposed suspension is invariably the ﬁrst analysis

performed by the designer in order to:

does not interfere with the body

There are three ways in which suspension kinematics can be analysed:

It is the third approach that we are going to use in the following example.

3.7 Roll Centres and Roll Axis

Roll centre and roll axis are important concepts for studying vehicle handling and
are also used in the calculation of lateral load transfer for cornering operations.

There are two deﬁnitions of roll centre. One is based on forces and the other on

kinematics. The ﬁrst of these (the SAE deﬁnition) states that:

(1) The roll centre is a point in the transverse plane through any pair of wheels at
which a transverse force may be applied to the sprung mass without causing it
to roll.
The second is a kinematic deﬁnition which states that:

(2) The roll centre is the point about which the body can roll without producing

any lateral movement at either of the wheel contact areas.

In general each roll centre lies on the vertical line produced by the intersection
of the longitudinal centre plane of the vehicle and the vertical transverse plane
through a pair of wheel centres. The roll centre heights in the front and rear wheel
planes tend to be different as shown in Fig. 3.45. The line joining the centres is

called the roll axis, with the implication that a transverse force applied to the sprung
mass at any point on this axis will not cause body roll.

3.7.1 Roll Centre Determination

For a given front or rear suspension, the roll centre can be determined from the
kinematic deﬁnition by using the Aronhold-Kennedy theorem of three centres. This
states: “when three bodies move relative to one another they have three instanta-
neous centres all of which lie on the same straight line”.

To illustrate the determination of roll centre by this method consider the double
wishbone suspension shown in Fig. 3.46. Consider the three bodies capable of
relative motion as being the sprung mass, the left-hand wheel and the ground. The
instantaneous centre of the wheel relative to the sprung mass Iwb, lies at the
intersection of the upper and lower wishbones, while that of the wheel relative to
the ground lies at Iwg. The instantaneous centre of the sprung mass relative to the
ground (the roll centre) Ibg, must (according to the above theorem) lie in the centre
plane of the vehicle and on the line joining Iwb and Iwg, as shown in the diagram.
Iwg always lies in the position shown in Fig. 3.46. Changing the inclination of
the upper and lower wishbones can vary Iwb, thereby altering the location of Ibg and
ultimately the load transfer between inner and outer wheels during cornering. In the
case of the McPherson strut suspension (Fig. 3.47) the upper line deﬁning Iwb is
perpendicular to the strut axis. Figures 3.48, 3.49 and 3.50 illustrate the locations of
roll centres for a variety of independent suspensions. The importance of roll centre
location is discussed below.

For the swing axle suspension shown in Fig. 3.48 the wheel pivots about the

inner swivel axis giving the roll centre as indicated.

Fig. 3.50 Roll centre location for semi-trailing arm suspension

constrained to move in a vertical plane (with no transverse movement) and hence
Iwb lies at inﬁnity along the pivot axis (to the right). The roll centre therefore lies in
the ground plane on the centre-line of the vehicle.

For the semi-trailing arm suspension (Fig. 3.50) the pivot axis is inclined and
intersects the vertical lateral plane through the wheel centre at Iwb a distance L from
the centre plane of the wheel. The roll centre Ibg lies on the line connecting Iwb with
the instantaneous centre of the wheel relative to the ground Iwg.

Figure 3.51 shows the roll centre determination for a four-link rigid axle sus-
pension. In this case the wheels and axle can be assumed to move as a rigid body.
The upper and lower control arms produce instant centres at A and B respectively
(projected to the vehicle centreline). Connecting these together produces a roll axis
for the suspension. The intersection of this axis with the transverse wheel plane
deﬁnes the roll centre.

The ﬁnal example illustrating roll centre determination is the Hotchkiss rear
suspension shown in Fig. 3.52. The analysis in this case is somewhat different to
the previous examples. Lateral forces are transmitted to the sprung mass at A and B.
The roll centre height is at the intersection of the line joining these points and the
vertical transverse plane through the wheel centres. The roll centre is of course at
this height in the centre plane of the vehicle.

3.7.2 Roll Centre Migration

When a suspension deﬂects, the roll centre locations move. Even for modest sus-
pension deﬂections, this migration of the roll centre can be quite signiﬁcant as
shown in Fig. 3.53, arising in this case from the vertical deﬂection of the vehicle
body. Large roll centre migrations can have undesirable effects on vehicle handling.
Hence attempts are made at the design stage to limit migration effects for the full
range of suspension travel. Some suspension types are more amenable than others
for controlling roll centre migration.

Fig. 3.53 Effect of suspension deﬂection on roll centre migration

A high roll centre produces low lateral load transfer (good anti-roll properties)
but produces high levels of half-track changes. The high roll centre is typically
closer to the centre of gravity and hence there is a reduced lever arm and lower roll
moment. Lateral forces generated under cornering therefore produce less roll.
However, the suspension geometry to give a high roll centre typically means that
the wheel scrub is signiﬁcant over the suspension travel, hence the larger half-track
changes.

A low roll centre produces small half-track changes but poor anti-roll properties.
The migration of the roll centre needs to be limited to minimise the steering

balance variation under different driving conditions as described below.

3.7.2.1 Steering Response

The balance between steady-state understeer/oversteer is largely dictated by the
front to rear lateral load transfer ratio which is dependent on roll centre heights.
This can be modiﬁed by changes in roll stiffness usually with anti-roll bars.
Migration of roll centres can create unwanted variations in steering balance.

3.7.2.2 Straight Line Stability

Increasing front to rear lateral load transfer ratio produces an understeer tendency.
Unsymmetrical road undulations induce half-track changes producing lateral force
variations at
the tyre contact patches with resultant steer effects. A positive
half-track change produces a force towards the vehicle centreline and this effect,
when combined with bump steer, will affect vehicle stability.

168

3 Suspension Systems and Components

3.7.2.3 Braking Stability

Roll centre migration due to braking induced pitch changes can cause plunging
front and rising rear roll centres resulting in an undesirable oversteer tendency.

3.7.2.4 Lift-off/Traction Steer on Bends

Roll centre migration due to induced pitch changes can cause variations in steering
balance (see Steering Response above).

3.7.2.5 Ride

Half-track changes produce resisting forces having a vertical component. In some
cases this may be large enough to affect ride quality. On asymmetric undulations,
the lateral forces due to half-track changes may excite roll-rock. Vehicle roll is
fundamentally linked to roll centre height, but can be modiﬁed by the use of
anti-roll bars.

3.7.2.6

Jacking

Vehicle jacking is affected by roll centre height.

3.8 Lateral Load Transfer Due to Cornering

During cornering, centrifugal (inertia) forces act horizontally on the sprung and
unsprung masses. These forces act above the ground plane through the respective
mass centres causing moments to be generated on the respective masses. These in
turn lead to changes in the vertical loads at the tyre which affect vehicle handling
and stability. In general the vertical loads increase on the outer wheels while the
loads on the inner wheels decrease.

The process of converting the transverse forces into vertical load changes is
termed lateral load transfer. Lateral load transfer due to cornering was considered
for a rigid body vehicle model in Chap. 1. Here the effects of deﬂections in the
vehicle suspension are considered to give more accurate predictions of lateral load
transfer effects using D’Alembert’s approach.

3.8.1 Load Transfer Due to Roll Moment

Refer the forces at G to point A on the roll axis. This requires the same forces to be
applied at A plus an equivalent moment due to the two forces, Ms, about the roll
axis:

Ms ¼ ms€xd cos / þ msgd sin / (cid:4) ms€xd þ msgd/

ð3:9Þ

where / may be considered as small.

Ms is reacted by a roll moment M/ (at the suspension springs and anti-roll bars)
and distributed to the front and rear suspensions. The relationship between Ms and
M/ is assumed to be linear for small angles of roll, i.e.

Ms ¼ M/ ¼ ks/

3.9 Spring Rate and Wheel Rate

In the following sections, we discuss how dynamic loads can be quantiﬁed and
analysed for some typical loading situations. The relationship between the suspen-
sion spring stiffness (spring rate) and the equivalent stiffness in the vertical plane of
the wheel (wheel rate) is examined. This relationship is important in terms of
determining suspension forces and the natural frequencies of vibration of the vehicle.
A generalised schematic of wheel load against wheel vertical displacement is
given in Fig. 3.55. The ﬁgure identiﬁes the critical points where the response
changes, e.g. due to engagement of a bump stop. Whilst the main suspension spring
and its associated spring rate may be linear (or intentionally designed to be
non-linear), the wheel rate is almost always non-linear owing to the suspension
geometry which deﬁnes how the spring rate translates to give the wheel rate.

3 Suspension Systems and Components

3.9.1 Wheel Rate Required for Constant Natural Frequency

Wheel rate is the vertical stiffness of the suspension in a wheel plane. One of the
many problems facing the suspension designer is that as the body mass of a vehicle
changes from the unladen to the laden condition, the natural frequency of the mass
can change. This is undesirable and happens when the wheel rate is constant over
the range of suspension travel. The problem can be overcome by arranging a wheel
rate that increases with suspension travel. The following analysis shows that it is
possible to determine how the wheel rate needs to vary in order to provide a
constant natural frequency as the payload changes.

A vehicle body mass supported on its suspension can be modelled most simply

as a mass on a spring for which the natural frequency is given by:

(cid:7) (cid:8)1

xn ¼ k
m

ds ¼ mg
k

xn ¼ ð g
ds

where k = wheel rate and m = effective sprung mass.

Equation (3.19) may ﬁrst of all be written in terms of an effective static

deﬂection, ds, which is deﬁned by:

Hence, substituting in Eq. (3.19) gives:

Note the need for consistency of units. When g is in m/s2 and ds is in m, the units

of xn are rad/s.

3.9 Spring Rate and Wheel Rate

177

A typical load-deﬂection curve for a rising-rate spring is shown in Fig. 3.56. The
effective rate is the local slope of this curve at a particular point. To maintain a
constant value of natural frequency requires a particular relationship between the
local spring rate and the load to maintain in effect a constant static deﬂection i.e.

Equation (3.23) now needs to be re-arranged and integrated to obtain an

expression for W as a function of x:

3.9.2 The Relationship Between Spring Rate and Wheel

Rate

The rising-rate stiffness of the suspension in the wheel-plane will dictate the
required characteristic for the suspension spring. The relationship between wheel
rate and spring rate will depend on the kinematics of the suspension. In general, the
displacement relationships between wheel travel and deﬂection across the suspen-
sion spring will be nonlinear. Some examples will illustrate how the relationship
can be obtained.

3.9.2.1 Basic Example

This example is based on the swing (live) axle suspension shown in Fig. 3.57, a
design that

example to introduce spring/wheel rate calculations. For the case shown in
Fig. 3.57, the wheel rate may be calculated as follows.

Assume the suspension spring has stiffness ks.
A small displacement, dw, at the wheel results in a displacement at the spring of:

Hence the spring force is:

Taking moments about the pivot at A (Fig. 3.57) gives:

Expressing the wheel force in terms of an effective wheel rate, kw, gives:

Substituting in Eq. (3.31) then gives:

In this case, the rates are related by the lever arm ratio (R = b/c) squared. This
is strictly valid only for small displacements around the mean position shown. For
larger displacements the relationship is non-linear.

3.10 Analysis of Forces in Suspension Members

A thorough analysis of all the forces in a suspension system is a complex problem
requiring the use of computer packages. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) packages can
be used for static analyses and stress distribution within members while Multi-Body
Dynamics (MBD) packages are required for the analysis of three-dimensional

3.10 Analysis of Forces in Suspension Members

dynamic loading. Analysing static forces is straightforward, but superimposed on
these are dynamic loads due to vertical and longitudinal road irregularities, braking,
accelerating, cornering etc. Many of these dynamic loads are of a transient nature and
are very difﬁcult to model. For this reason they tend to be modelled by dynamic load
factors.

Despite all the complexities associated with practical situations, it is nevertheless
possible to carry out some simple design calculations. These can be carried out
graphically for a given load application and enable the loads in the suspension
members and at body mounting points to be determined. Inevitably these calcu-
lations involve some simplifying assumptions. Some examples below illustrate the
procedure.

3.10.1 Longitudinal Loads Due to Braking and Accelerating

longitudinal and lateral

tyre loads have been discussed brieﬂy in
Vertical,
Sect. 3.1.6. It is useful to examine in a little more detail the generation of longi-
tudinal loads arising from vehicle control actions such as braking and accelerating.
For these cases the loads are dependent on how braking and drive torques are
reacted. They in turn depend upon whether the vehicle has inboard or outboard
brakes and whether the drive is to a live axle or via an independent suspension
system.

3.10.1.1 Braking—Outboard Brakes (Braking at the Wheel)

In this case the braking torque is reacted at the hub assembly. Consider the
free-body diagram of the wheel in Fig. 3.59a. The corresponding force and moment
on the hub carrier are shown in Fig. 3.59b. These provide the suspension loading.
An equivalent suspension loading is shown in Fig. 3.59c.

3.10.1.2 Braking—Inboard Brakes (Braking Inboard on the Axle)

In this case (for example the De Dion suspension), the braking torque is reacted
inboard at the vehicle body. The free-body diagram of the wheel is the same as in
Fig. 3.60a. However, in this case, there is no moment exerted on the hub carrier.
The suspension load is simply equal to the longitudinal tyre force acting through the
centre of the hub, Fig. 3.60a. An equivalent (resultant) force system is shown in
Fig. 3.60b.

3.10.2 Vertical Loading

3.10.2.1 Double Wishbone Suspension Example

A diagram of a double wishbone suspension in which the spring acts on the lower
arm is shown in Fig. 3.63. The following assumptions are made:
(cid:129) Loads due to the masses themselves are ignored on the basis that they will be
insigniﬁcant compared with loads arising from the static wheel load, Fw.
(cid:129) All joints are treated as simple pin joints so that effects of friction, compliance in

bushes etc. are ignored.

(cid:129) The problem can be treated in two dimensions.

The static wheel load, FW, would typically be calculated from the vehicle data.
The problem then is to calculate the forces transmitted to the body mounting points.
Clearly this is a statics problem since all the members are in equilibrium and the
simplest approach is a graphical one. The free body diagrams and associated force
vector diagrams are shown in Fig. 3.63.

Note the following features in obtaining these results:

(cid:129) The force in the upper arm DA must be along the link since it is pin-jointed at

both ends.

(cid:129) Consider the wheel plus kingpin assembly ﬁrst and construct the FBD. The
directions of FW and FD are known so the direction of FC can be found (it must
pass through G for equilibrium).

(cid:129) Next, the FBD for the lower arm can be drawn.

A full numerical solution to this problem requires that (i) the position diagram of
the linkage is drawn to scale to deﬁne all the geometry and (ii) the force vector

diagrams are either drawn to scale or the forces are calculated using the geometry
deﬁned by the force vector diagrams.

In order to analyse the suspension forces over the full range of suspension travel,
the procedure can be repeated at suitable increments between full bump and
rebound positions. To do this, some data about either the spring rate or the wheel
rate must be known or assumed. For example, if the load-deﬂection curve for the

3.10 Analysis of Forces in Suspension Members

185

Fig. 3.64 Typical load versus deﬂection characteristics for spring and wheel

spring is known, then the load-deﬂection curve for the wheel can be plotted and the
effective wheel rate calculated (Fig. 3.64). Note that because of geometrical effects,
the relationship between wheel deﬂection and spring deﬂection is not linear and so
even a linear spring will result in a non-linear wheel rate as deﬁned by Eq. (3.40)
for example. An alternative calculation is to assume a particular wheel rate and
hence calculate the spring load-deﬂection curve (Fig. 3.65). This deﬁnes the spring
characteristics necessary to achieve a desired wheel rate, which again may be linear
or non-linear.

assumptions as in the previous section are made and in addition the strut is treated
as a piston which is free to slide within a cylinder. The free body and force vector
diagrams are constructed as follows:
(cid:129) The force in the arm, CB, is along its longitudinal axis since it is pin-jointed at

both ends and there are no loads applied along its length.

(cid:129) For the wheel-axle-strut assembly, DCE, the resultant force at D must pass

through point G for equilibrium.

(cid:129) The force at D is reacted by two components: the spring force in the direction of
AC and a side force on the cylinder. Note that this is only true if the spring is
concentric with the strut AC. The side force is undesirable since it produces
friction and wear on the piston in the strut. Mounting the spring more nearly in
line with AG can reduce this side force and this is commonly done in
McPherson strut designs.

3.10.3 Lateral, Longitudinal and Mixed Loads

When a lateral tyre force is applied in addition to a vertical load, the analysis for the
example in Fig. 3.63 is modiﬁed to that shown in Fig. 3.67. The resultant wheel
force is ﬁrst calculated from the vector combination of FW and FY. This then deﬁnes

a new point for G and the force acting on the lower link is changed in both
magnitude and direction compared with the previous analysis.

For loads in the fore-aft direction, the situation is shown in Fig. 3.68. A fore-aft
load may be applied at either points E or O (i.e. at right angles to the plane of the
diagram.) A force at the tyre-ground contact point, E, would arise from braking with
conventional outboard brakes. The resulting braking torque is transmitted through
the stub axle/kingpin assembly which may be treated as a single rigid member. If
the fore-aft force is due to aerodynamic drag, shock loading, braking with inboard
brakes or traction, then its effective point of application is at the wheel centre, O.
In general any force at a given point may be treated as the same force at another
point plus a couple around that point. This is a convenient way of analysing the
effect of these fore-aft forces. If the fore-aft force (FX) is moved to the kingpin axis
then a moment of either FX d1 or FX d2 acts around the kingpin axis. This moment
is, in practice, reacted by the steering arm and track rod so that the force FTR in the
track rod is either:

or

FTR ¼ FXd1
d3

FTR ¼ FXd2
d3

ð3:41Þ

ð3:42Þ

where d3 is the effective moment arm of the steering arm around the kingpin axis.
In the side view (Fig. 3.69), the torque due to this longitudinal force is reacted
by the forces in the upper and lower arms. It may then be possible to proceed to
analyse all the forces on the upper and lower arms. However, the analysis is now
starting to become complicated. Remember also we are not taking proper account of
all the three dimensional effects. Despite this, our simple analysis does provide a
good indication of the primary forces in the suspension. The subtle effects arising
from a full three-dimensional treatment are of secondary importance.

3.10.4 Limit or Bump Stops

Suspension travel is limited by bump stops. Normally these are made of rubber and
produce a rapidly increasing spring rate with deﬂection. This obviously prevents
damage from metal to metal contact and provides a rapidly increasing force to react
the extreme motion of the wheel.

There are two philosophies involved in bump stop design. The ﬁrst, and perhaps
more conventional approach is to make them relatively short and stiff; this means
that contact is relatively infrequent and restricted to extreme events. The forces
involved are high. The second approach is to make them relatively long and

3.10 Analysis of Forces in Suspension Members

189

compliant; this means that they come into contact much more often, but much lower
forces are involved and they may be viewed as a secondary spring. This effectively
helps to stiffen the suspension for large deﬂections. Whichever approach is adopted,
contact with the bump stops changes the force system in the suspension members.
An example is shown in Fig. 3.70. One method of tackling this problem is by
superposition, i.e. by separating the forces arising from the main suspension spring
at full deﬂection from those due to the bump stop spring. Both sets of suspension
loads are then added together using the principle of superposition.

The procedure is as follows:

(a) Draw the suspension in the required position (in contact with the bump stop).
(b) Ignoring the force due to the bump stop compression, determine the forces and

3.10.5 Modelling Transient Loads

In order to safeguard the robustness of a suspension it is particularly important that
the effects of worst-case loading scenarios are analysed. These tend to arise from the
transient (shock) loads due to wheels striking potholes and kerbs as well as from
panic braking.

Because every set of events is likely to be different, designers tend to cover
worst-case scenarios by using load factors based on the static wheel load. Different
manufacturers tend to adopt their own set of design factors. Alternatively, the
manufacturers work to a set of worst-case accelerations along the different vehicle
axes; a typical example is shown in Table 3.1. The force loadings can then be
obtained using an appropriate mass for the wheel and unsprung mass.

3.11 Suspension Geometry to Combat Squat and Dive

Squat (nose up) and dive (nose down) are changes in vehicle body attitude arising
respectively from acceleration and braking. It is possible to design a suspension that
will combat squat or dive; however, the geometry required for anti-squat will be
different to that for anti-dive. Again, this is one of those areas of suspension design
that requires compromises to be made. The design requirements to combat dive
depend on whether a vehicle has outboard or inboard brakes, while anti-squat
design depends on whether the vehicle has dependent or independent suspension. In
the latter case, suspension stiffness also plays a part.

3.11.1 Anti-dive Geometry

The free body diagram for a car during braking is shown in Fig. 3.71. Note the
pseudo (D’Alembert) force, m€x, in which €x is the deceleration. Braking forces, Bf
and Br, are applied at the front and rear wheel pairs and the relationship between
them is deﬁned by the ﬁxed braking ratio:

Under these conditions, the vertical loads on the axles are different from their

static values, and can be calculated as follows.

Taking moments about the rear tyre contact patch:

Giving:

The ﬁrst term is the static load and the second term is the load transfer due to

braking. Hence, the load at the rear is:

This load transfer term will cause an increased deﬂection at the front axle and a
reduced deﬂection at the rear axle. Hence the change of attitude of the vehicle body.

Consider now the diagram of the front suspension shown in Fig. 3.72. The axis of
the link pivots are inclined such that the effective centre of rotation of the wheel in

Hence, if the instantaneous centre of the suspension Of lies anywhere along the
line deﬁned by Eq. (3.53) then the condition for no front suspension deﬂection

at an angle of a0 say, then the percentage anti-dive is deﬁned as

A similar analysis can be applied at the rear (Fig. 3.73) to give

Again, if the instantaneous centre lies along the line deﬁned by Eq. (3.55), then
will be no change in spring force and hence no lift will occur. Therefore, the
condition for 100% anti-dive is that the front and rear instantaneous centres lie
along the two lines shown in Fig. 3.74.

(cid:129) Full anti-dive can cause large castor angle changes because all the brake torque
is reacted through the suspension links. Such castor changes may tend to make
the steering unacceptably heavy during braking.

3.11.1.2

Inboard Brakes (Braking Inboard on the Axle e.g. de Dion
Suspension)

All the foregoing analysis applies to the most common case in which the brakes are
mounted outboard, i.e. at the wheel. Inboard brake systems differ in that the brake
torque is reacted through the driveshaft (Sect. 3.10.3.1). The situation for say a front
wheel is shown in Fig. 3.75. The additional torque applied by the driveshaft to the

Mf ¼ Bf r ¼ m€xkr

Now, taking moments about Of gives:

Comparing this with Eq. (3.49), it can be seen that an additional term is now

both in the special case of four-wheel drive. There are two general cases to consider:
solid axle drive or independent suspension/driveshaft designs.

3.11.2.1 Solid Rear Drive Axle

This conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 3.77 with the driven rear axle assumed to be
mounted on twin trailing arms, with an instantaneous centre of rotation at Or. This
point is sometimes referred to as the virtual reaction point (i.e. the point at which
the forces in the suspension arms can be resolved and assumed to act on the vehicle
body). Note that this treatment of the suspension is exactly the same as if a trailing
arm of length, d, connected rigidly to the rear axle acting about a pivot at Or. Note
that the drive torque is reacted through the axle casing and the suspension members
(thus making the analysis analogous to the case of outboard brakes). The analysis
assumes that the axle mass is small relative to the vehicle mass.

3.12 Vehicle Ride Analysis

Ride comfort is one of the most important characteristics deﬁning the quality of a
vehicle. It is principally related to vehicle body vibration, the dominant source of
which is due to road surface irregularities. In order to design vehicles that have
good ride properties, it is essential to be able to model ride performance in the early
stages of vehicle development. This requires an understanding of road surface
characteristics, human response to vibration and vehicle modelling principles.
These are introduced in the following sections.

3.12.1 Road Surface Roughness and Vehicle Excitation

When a vehicle traverses over a road proﬁle, the irregularities in the proﬁle are
converted into time-varying vertical displacement excitation inputs at each tyre
contact patch. In general, road surfaces have random proﬁles which means that the
excitations that they generate are also of a random nature.

The spatial random proﬁle of a road surface can be frequency analysed and
shown to comprise a set of harmonic components having different amplitudes and
wavelengths as shown in Fig. 3.79. In general the components having the longest
wavelengths have the largest amplitudes. While only three components are shown
in Fig. 3.79, there are in reality an inﬁnite number. For a given frequency com-
ponent it is possible to deﬁne spatial frequency “n” as the number of cycles per
metre. It can then be shown that the frequency characteristics of the proﬁle are
described as a function of “n”, by the spatial power spectral density S(n). The
SI units of S are m3/cycle.

From large amounts of measured road data it has been established that S and n

are related approximately by:

S nð Þ ¼ j n(cid:3)2:5

ð3:72Þ

where j is the road roughness coefﬁcient. Typical values of j for a motorway,
a principal road and a minor road are 0.25 (cid:2) 10−6, 4 (cid:2) 10−6 and 15 (cid:2) 10−6 m2/
(cycle/m) respectively for 0.01 < n < 10 cycle/m.

Fig. 3.79 Harmonic components of a random road surface proﬁle

When a vehicle travels at a velocity V m/s over a random road proﬁle described
by S(n), the resulting random excitation to the vehicle is described by a temporal
spectral density S(f), where f = n V is the excitation frequency in Hz.

It may be shown that:

it follows from Eq. (3.72) that:

The SI units for S(f) are m2/Hz. The variation of S(f) for a vehicle traversing a
poor minor road at 20 m/s is shown in Fig. 3.80. It is important to note the dis-
tribution of frequency components in this spectrum in relation to the natural fre-
quencies of a suspended vehicle.

3.12.2 Human Perception of Ride

Ride is dominated by the level of road induced vibration in a vehicle body. In
assessing ride performance of a vehicle it is necessary to take into account the
sensitivity of the human body to vibration.

The human body is sensitive to vibration and has a number of its own natural
frequencies. It follows that, when the human body is subjected to excitation at any
of these frequencies, resonance and discomfort will result. From the previous sec-
tion, it is obvious that road induced vibration will be broadband and hence some of
the components of the excitation will tend to produce human body resonance. From
an understanding of human body resonances, it is possible to weight the vehicle
body response in order to obtain a single ﬁgure for assessment of ride performance.

Fig. 3.81 Equal discomfort curves for different time durations

From a vibration point of view, the human body can be considered to be a
complex assemblage of mass, elastic and damping elements that result in a number
of natural frequencies in the range from 1 to 900 Hz. From a ride point of view, we
are concerned with whole-body vibration of a seated person in the range from 0.5 to
15 Hz. There are two whole-body natural frequencies in this range. They are
associated with the head-neck (1–2 Hz) and the thorax-abdomen (4–8 Hz) reso-
nances. Head-neck resonance can be excited by vehicle pitching and rolling
motions while resonance of the thorax-abdomen can be produced by vehicle bounce
motion.

In general the tolerance to whole-body vibration decreases with time, so a high
level of vibration for a short time can produce the same level of discomfort as a low
level for a long time. Equal discomfort curves have been produced in standards, e.g.
International Standard ISO 2631 and British Standard BS. 6841:1987. Some
examples are given in Fig. 3.81 for vertical and longitudinal/lateral excitation. It
should be noticed that the human body is acceleration-sensitive and the minimum
values of the graphs correspond to the resonances discussed above.

The shapes of the graphs are used to establish weighting curves that can be
applied to vehicle body accelerations determined from simulations of vehicle
response to road induced vibration. This enables a single ﬁgure estimate of human
response to be obtained. A typical weighting curve for vertical vibration is shown in
Fig. 3.82. This weighting would be applied to the measured/calculated vibration
level at the passenger seat position.

3.13 Vehicle Ride Models

Ride performance is assessed at the design stage by simulation of vehicle response
to road excitation. This requires the development of a vehicle model and analysis of
its response. Models of varying complexity are used. For a passenger car, the most
comprehensive of these has seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) as shown in
Fig. 3.83. These comprise three DOFs for the vehicle body (pitch, bounce and roll)
and a further vertical DOF at each of the four unsprung masses. This model allows
the pitch, bounce and roll performance of the vehicle to be studied.

The suspension stiffness and damping rates in the model are derived from the
individual spring and damping units using the kinematics approach discussed in
Sect. 3.3. Various tyre models have been proposed. The simplest of these uses a
point-contact model to represent the elasticity and damping in the tyre with a simple
spring and viscous damper. Since tyre damping is several orders of magnitude
lower than suspension damping, it can be neglected in basic vehicle models.

Much useful information can be derived from simpler vehicle models than shown
in Fig. 3.83. For a normal road surface proﬁle the components having the longer
wavelength components are in phase (coherent) across the left and right tracks of a
vehicle and there is therefore no tendency to excite body roll. This then justiﬁes the
use of a half vehicle model as shown in Fig. 3.84. This has four DOFs: a body mass
translation and rotation, plus a translation for each of the unsprung axle masses.

The half vehicle model can be simpliﬁed still further to a quarter vehicle model if
the body mass satisﬁes certain conditions. Let the total sprung mass in Fig. 3.83 be
denoted by M and its moment of inertia about its centre of gravity CofG by “I”. The
CofG is located longitudinally from the wheel centres by distances a and b. The
wheelbase is L. For the sprung mass in Fig. 3.84 to be dynamically equivalent to
that in Fig. 3.85 the following conditions have to be satisﬁed for the dynamically
equivalent sprung masses Mf and Mr located above the front and rear suspensions
respectively.

mass Mr at the rear suspension and the motions at the front and rear suspensions are
uncoupled. For this case a quarter vehicle model as shown in Fig. 3.86 can rep-
resent either the front or rear suspension.

3.13.1 Vibration Analysis of the Quarter Vehicle Model

The model shown in Fig. 3.86 consists of linear elements, i.e. the springs and
dampers have linear characteristics. These are valid approximations for small
oscillations about the static equilibrium position of the system. Further details of the
analysis methodology for a 2 DOF system are given in the Appendix. Let x0, z1 and
z2 be time varying displacements from the equilibrium position.

To understand the modes and frequencies of vibration of the system shown in
Fig. 3.86, it is instructive to consider the free vibration response of the corre-
sponding undamped system. For this case it is assumed that suspension damping
Cs = 0 and the free vibration of the model (x0 = 0) is then given by:

This indicates that since the result is positive, both masses move in the same
direction at any instant and the amplitude at the unsprung mass is 0.104 times that
of the sprung mass. This mode of vibration is called the body bounce mode and can
be represented graphically as shown in Fig. 3.87a. Note amplitudes are plotted
horizontally for clarity.

The negative ratio indicates the masses are moving in opposite directions at any

mass. This mode of vibration is called the wheel hop mode and can be represented
graphically as shown in Fig. 3.87b.

From the above analysis, it is apparent that for the body bounce mode the
amplitude of the unsprung mass is very small compared to that of the sprung mass,
so in this case the system could be approximated as shown in Fig. 3.88a. Also, for
the wheel hop mode, the amplitude of the sprung mass is very small in comparison
to that of the unsprung mass. For this mode, the system could be approximated as
shown in Fig. 3.88b. The corresponding approximate natural frequencies and
damping ratios for a lightly damped system are as shown in Fig. 3.88. Note that the
springs in wheel hop mode act in parallel so the effective stiffness is Ks + Kt.

The car travels at speed over cobble stones—shown in Fig. E3.7.1—that are

It is required to calculate:

(a) The number of active coils on the front and rear coil springs.
(b) The safe speed the car can travel and the maximum amplitude of the undulation
without the front tyres losing road contact due to wheel hop. Neglect any
variable load due to spring/tyre deﬂection resulting from the undulations and
any damper effects.

the front and rear suspensions

Front f ¼ 1:43 Hz giving x ¼ 2pf ¼ 8:986 rad=s
Rear f ¼ 1:80 Hz giving x ¼ 2pf ¼ 11:31 rad=s

Note: The tyre stiffness will comprise the core stiffness which will be pre-
dominately dictated by the tyre pressure, and the tyre rubber crown or tread. The
rubber stiffness will be signiﬁcantly lower than the core and as the core and rubber
are in series the core stiffness will not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on overall
stiffness. The rubber will compress appreciably more than the core and it is this
tyre grip. The amplitude calculated
contact area that provides the lateral

still be in contact with the road but with a much lower loading and therefore much
reduced ability to provide lateral grip.

3.14 Concluding Remarks

The chapter provides a foundation for understanding suspension systems and the
processes needed to undertake ﬁrst order analyses of suspension system dynamics
and kinematics. It provides information on current designs and leads the reader to
consider more advanced systems as superior vehicle reﬁnement becomes increas-
ingly in demand. Other areas that the designer needs to consider are determining the
safe working space or travel of the suspension system. This will include deter-
mining the working stroke of the spring and damper before bump stops are
engaged. It is necessary for the designer to also ensure the coil springs never bottom
under full load as increased stresses will be induced in the coils with a shortening of
life and performance. Finally there is a need to determine the forces induced onto
the suspension system either from road conditions or unusual impacts in order to
ensure the system will be sufﬁciently robust to endure such loads yet not result in
too heavy a vehicle. These issues are further considered in Chap. 4 that follows.
Most important is the realisation that no design area stands alone and that chassis
suspension design needs to inﬂuence the design decisions taken on other vehicle
systems (and vice versa).

Chapter 4
Vehicle Structures and Materials

Abstract This chapter commences with a review of chassis structures for the dif-
ferent classes of road vehicles including mass-produced passenger cars, high per-
formance vehicles, small sports cars and commercial vehicles. It proceeds to
consider the different materials used in vehicle structures with a focus on reducing
vehicle weight and therefore emissions through the use of high strength steel, alu-
minium and composite materials. The following section outlines different methods
of analysis of vehicle structures including both traditional theoretical methods and
modern computational techniques. Crash safety of vehicles under impact loading is
then considered and a particular case study of the crashworthiness of a small space
frame sports car presented in detail. The ﬁnal section of the chapter deals with the
durability assessment of vehicle structures and again includes a detailed case study
of the fatigue assessment and optimisation of a suspension component.

4.1 Review of Vehicle Structures

The purpose of any road vehicle structure is to support all the major components
and sub-assemblies making up the complete vehicle (i.e. engine, transmission,
suspension, etc.) and also carry the passengers and/or payload in a safe and com-
fortable manner.

In the early years of motor vehicles, both passenger cars and commercial
vehicles were manufactured in the traditional way with a separate chassis frame
onto which a non-structural body shell was attached. This form of construction has
survived in commercial vehicles and also in specialist car brands such as Morgan.
Since the chassis frame carries all the applied loads (i.e. dead-weight loads due to
self-weight of vehicle and payload as well as “live” loads due to aerodynamic and
dynamic tyre loads), it must be sufﬁciently strong and rigid. Most chassis frames are
of ladder form, that
is two longitudinal members connected by a number of
transverse or cross-members which may not all be perpendicular to the longitudinal
members but may take a diagonal or cruciform shape. The body shell serves mainly
as a protection from the elements; it is generally isolated from the chassis via
Vehicle Structures and Materials

ﬂexible mountings (usually rubber) and therefore contributes very little to the
overall vehicle stiffness.

The principal drawback of the separate chassis frame is that it is essentially a 2D
structure and the members therefore have to be of high section modulus and are
relatively heavy. Moreover it invariably leads to mounting problems due to the
large difference in stiffness between the frame and the body shell. However, this
type of construction is still a popular form of construction in commercial vehicles
since a variety of different forms of body shell can be often mounted on a common
ladder-type frame and the weight of the vehicle structure is of less concern than its
overall load-carrying capability, see Fig. 4.1 for a typical example.

Following World War II, the drive to produce a more efﬁcient structure for
passenger cars led to the development of semi-integral forms of construction. These
retain a strong chassis structure but, by mounting the body shell in a more rigid
manner, the latter is required to carry a proportion of the applied loads. Of course,
the body shell then has to be designed to withstand these loads and even more
attention has to be paid to the mounting points between the frame and body because
force transmission between the two structures. Moreover,
of
semi-integral vehicles remain relatively heavy and have to be carefully assembled
to tight tolerances since small misalignments can greatly increase stress concen-
trations near mounting points.

4.1 Review of Vehicle Structures

217

The ﬁnal shape in the development of the structure of mass-produced passenger
cars was the emergence of unitary or integral forms of construction. As the name
suggests, such vehicles have no discernible separate chassis and the whole body is
designed as an integral unit capable of reacting the applied loads and providing the
necessary stiffness to the vehicle. This form of construction produces a structure
which is truly 3D in the way it deforms and carries load. Thus it can be designed to
be signiﬁcantly lighter than traditional chassis-framed vehicles because of the rel-
atively large depth of the fabricated structures used to resist the bending and tor-
sional loads. However, since these structures are conventionally manufactured from
relatively thin sheet steel or aluminium, they very often have to be stiffened with
reinforcements or made as box sections. This requires complex tooling and
assembly techniques, the cost of which can only be justiﬁed for mass produced
vehicles. Figure 4.2 shows a modern aluminium integral body shell on a robotic
assembly line. The complexity of the body shell as well as the robotic manufac-
turing processes employed in its construction are obvious.

Alongside the mass-produced integral steel and (more recently) aluminium
structured vehicles, a number of alternative forms of construction exist for more
specialised, low volume passenger vehicles. These range from the conventional
chassis plus separate body used on traditional sports cars such as the Morgan, to the
high-tech aluminium plus composite construction employed in the latest high
performance sports vehicles such as manufactured by Lotus. Composites consisting

4 Vehicle Structures and Materials

of a thermo-setting epoxy or polyester resin reinforced with glass ﬁbre mat have of
course for a long time been used in the construction of body parts for niche sports
cars (or as replacements for corroded steel parts in mass-produced vehicles).
Recently, more advanced composites using a tougher thermoplastic matrix and
stronger, stiffer ﬁbres such as carbon or Kevlar have been introduced as
load-bearing members in sports cars and other specialised vehicles. Of course, the
body structure of F1 Grand Prix cars and similar relies almost exclusively on the
use of carbon ﬁbre composite materials to give the exceptional stiffness, strength
and lightness of these vehicles.

An important class of vehicle in the small sports car category utilises the
so-called space-frame chassis form of construction. A true space-frame is a col-
lection of tubular members usually welded together and triangulated in such a way
that the members carry load in tension and compression only and do not suffer
bending or torsional to any signiﬁcant degree. A good example of this form of
construction is the Caterham Super Seven (formerly the Lotus Seven) illustrated in
Fig. 4.3. The main members are predominantly square Sect. 16 swg or 18 swg steel
tubes (with some round tube at certain locations) which are MIG welded together to
produce a strong and stiff frame to which all other components of the vehicle
(engine, suspension, body panels, etc.) are mounted directly. Such space-frame
chassis are widely employed in the kit car market as well as in the construction of
low cost race cars such as in Formula Student/SAE due to the low cost of tooling
for such space frames.

Considering brieﬂy commercial vehicle structures, most of these employ a
separate chassis frame generally manufactured from rolled steel sections of channel
or I-beam form. Two main longitudinal members usually extend the full length of

the vehicle. These are joined together by cross members to form a ladder and/or
cruciform shape as illustrated in Fig. 4.1. The power unit, driving controls, axles
and the cab unit are mounted directly on the chassis frame and often form a
self-contained unit. A separate loading platform or a superstructure is also mounted
on the frame according to the usage for which the unit is intended. A strong
structural panel (or bulkhead) normally extends upwards to the full height of the cab
to give protection to the driver and to prevent the load from moving forward under
heavy loading. Articulated vehicles which consist of a tractor unit and a separate
trailer employ a similar form of construction except that only the tractor unit needs
to accommodate the cab and powertrain. Finally, bus structures usually employ a
sturdy 3D frame which is mounted rigidly onto the chassis and to which the body
panels are attached. Roll-over and side impact protection are obviously of great
importance in bus and coach structural design whereas, for heavy good vehicles,
rear and side guards to prevent other vehicles from “submarining” beneath the
chassis structure during crash scenarios are mandatory.

4.2 Materials for Light Weight Car Body Structures

The mandatory requirements for vehicle manufacturers to reduce their ﬂeet average
emissions of CO2 have led not only to developments in powertrains such as
down-sized IC engines and hybrid/electric drives but also to a strong motivation to
reduce vehicle weights. Reduced vehicle mass reduces fuel consumption and gives
enhanced acceleration/deceleration/handling performance. It can also reduce dam-
age to road surfaces and generally enhances road safety because the kinetic energy
of vehicles is reduced. Even commercial vehicles can beneﬁt from lightweight
chassis construction because hauliers can then increase the payload for a speciﬁed
Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).

In terms of integral forms of construction, interstitial-free steels (alloyed with
small amounts of titanium to remove carbon from interstitial sites) have been
introduced to reduce the thickness, and hence weight, of body panels. High strength
low alloy (HSLA) steels (alloyed with manganese to increase strength and with
niobium/vanadium to provide grain reﬁnement) have also been widely used. More
recently advanced high strength steels (AHSS) have been introduced because of
their enhanced mechanical properties including good impact energy absorbing
behaviour (except for the very high strength steels which are relatively brittle).
These AHSS’s typically include phases of hard steel such as martensite, bainite or
austenite in addition to the more usual ferrite/pearlite microstructure. The resulting
enhanced yield stress enables panel thicknesses to be further reduced but also
causes manufacturing difﬁculties due to the reduced ductility and the high amounts
of elastic energy stored that can exacerbate problems such as “springback” fol-
lowing forming operations (springback is the tendency of a pressed panel to return
to its original shape after the forming operation).

220

4 Vehicle Structures and Materials

One way to mitigate against these forming difﬁculties is the use of tailor-welded
blanks (TWBs). These consist of multiple sheets of different shapes and thicknesses
that are welded together and then pressed to the required shape. This means that the
thickness can be enhanced where necessary for structural stiffness but elsewhere
can be made thinner to improve formability and further reduce weight. Optimisation
of the beneﬁts of TWB’s requires detailed understanding and analysis of body shell
in-service loading. Knowledge of the relevant formability properties of the mate-
rials as well as their costs is also required.

In recent years, much attention has been paid at the high end of the passenger car
market to the replacement of steel body shells with aluminium alloy which has a
much lower density (about 2700 kg/m3 compared with 7800 kg/m3 for steel). As
with steel, there are many different grades of aluminium alloy and different heat
treatments are possible to give a wide range of material properties with yield
strengths varying from about 70 MPa up to 700 MPa after age hardening. As with
any metallic material, higher yield strength alloys have lower ductility and are
therefore more difﬁcult to form. For this reason, advanced body shells often employ
a mixture of pressed sheet, extruded and cast aluminium components, such as in the
Audi design shown in Fig. 4.4 which utilises steel, carbon ﬁbre composite and even
magnesium components as well as aluminium to form a hybrid structure which can
be regarded as a space-frame. Both aluminium and magnesium alloys can be

4.2 Materials for Light Weight Car Body Structures

pressure die cast (with or without vacuum assistance) which produces intricate parts
with good properties especially in relation to dynamic loading.

Aluminium alloys can be laser, spot or metal inert gas (MIG) welded and are
also very suitable for adhesive bonding. Higher strength alloys (e.g. the 6000 series
commonly used in aerospace applications) are being increasingly used, often with
quick hardening compositions so that age hardening can occur during the coating or
painting processes. Developments in the properties of cast alloys have led to the
consideration of aluminium for demanding applications such as the frontal impact
longitudinal rails shown in blue in Fig. 4.4 and even in brake rotors where heavy
ferrous materials are currently used.

Apart from its higher cost in comparison to steel, a further issue with aluminium
is that it is more difﬁcult to recycle. Again special alloys and processes have been
developed to facilitate recycling e.g. the RC5754 alloy used extensively by Jaguar
Land Rover in body shells such as shown in Fig. 4.2 contains up to 50% recycled
material. In fact Jaguar aims to be using 75% recycled material in its aluminium
body shells in the near future.

Alongside the developments in high performance metallic materials, polymeric
matrix composites are being increasingly used in chassis structures. Over the past
10 years or so, the low cost, low tech glass ﬁbre and the more expensive, high tech
carbon ﬁbre technologies have converged so that high performance composites
have become an affordable option for body parts on normal road cars. There is now
a wide choice of reinforcement types (short or continuous, randomly or fully
aligned carbon, glass or aramid ﬁbres) in both thermosetting (epoxy, polyester,
vinyl ester) and thermoplastic (PP, PEEK) polymer matrices. Composite production
processes have become more automated with much shorter cycle times. Prominent
amongst these processes is Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) whereby ﬁbre rein-
forcement preforms are inﬁltrated by liquid polymer under carefully controlled
conditions to achieve the near ﬁnal net shape within a short cycle time.

Since complete composite body shells are likely to remain the reserve of high
performance sports and race cars, an issue for more mass produced vehicles is the
joining of a composite component to its metallic neighbours within a hybrid body
shell. Since composites generally cannot be welded, the obvious joining technique
is adhesive bonding but such joints need to be carefully designed and tested to
demonstrate their integrity. An alternative is to incorporate metal ﬁxing devices
within the composite during the manufacturing process.

The modern vehicle structure designer is faced with a wide choice of different
materials and manufacturing techniques. Not only must the complete body shell be
lightweight and sufﬁciently stiff and strong, it should also be cheap and relatively
easy to manufacture. It most also aim to protect the vehicle occupants and other
road users from serious injury during road trafﬁc accidents. From an environmental
point of view, it is important to reduce the vehicle weight whilst at the same time
improving the carbon footprint and recyclability of the materials used in its con-
struction. Advanced computer simulation techniques exist which enable designers
to predict both the manufacturability and on-road performance of the materials and

components selected. Overall, with this seemingly never-ending choice of materials
and manufacturing techniques, it is an exciting and challenging time for the vehicle
structure designer.

4.3 Analysis of Car Body Structures

4.3.1 Structural Requirements

The structural requirements of any vehicle structure can be summarised as follows:
1. The structure must be sufﬁciently stiff to react the static loads (i.e. mainly due to
dead-weight) and dynamic loads (i.e. mainly due to driving over rough terrain
and handling manoeuvres) without excessive deformation.

2. The structure must be sufﬁciently strong to withstand many cycles of the applied
loading without suffering from fatigue or other forms of material failure.

3. The structure should deform in such a manner under impact load conditions so

as to minimise the risk of injury to the occupants and other road users.
The ﬁrst job of any vehicle structure designer is to ensure that requirement 1 is
met since this is critically dependant on the overall structural layout and determines
how the vehicle will handle during normal and extreme manoeuvres. Basically, in
order for the suspension system to perform the tasks it is designed for, its mounting
points should remain as stationary with reference to the vehicle axis system as
possible. There are three main categories of dynamic loading which tend to deform
the vehicle structure about these mounting points:

i. Torsional loads such as when one wheel hits a bump in the road and the
additional suspension load at that corner of the car is transmitted through the
vehicle structure.

ii. Bending loads such as when both wheels on an axle hit a bump or a kerb

simultaneously.

iii. Longitudinal/lateral loads due to inertia effects under traction, braking and/or
cornering conditions, including the in-plane effects of minor collisions and
impacts.

Although in principle all three of these loading types can act simultaneously, the
ﬁrst of these is the most signiﬁcant and the latter relatively unimportant in terms of
the chassis structure itself. Thus the torsional stiffness of the structure is perhaps the
most important parameter to be considered in the initial stages of a chassis design. It
is normally measured or calculated by ﬁxing the suspension mounting points at
three corners of the car and applying a vertical load at the fourth corner as indicated

in Fig. 4.5. The applied torque (i.e. P (cid:1) W) divided by the angle of twist (i.e.

Although a high torsional stiffness is desirable, there is usually a weight penalty
involved in stiffening a vehicle structure. Therefore a suitable parameter to be
optimised at the design stage is the torsional stiffness per unit weight. Also a very
high stiffness may lead to NVH problems with little attenuation of suspension load
variations arising from running on rough roads and problems at the support points
of the more ﬂexible body members.

A computer simulation of a typical space frame under torsional loading is shown
in Fig. 4.6. The same chassis under torsional test in the laboratory is shown in
Fig. 4.7. Note how the chassis is loaded through the front suspension members but
that the shock absorbers have been replaced by rigid struts. The unique feature of
this particular sports car space-frame is that it uses double-butted welded joints
throughout which enables the tube thickness to be reduced where appropriate and

4.3 Analysis of Car Body Structures

225

the overall chassis weight to be minimised, albeit at greater material and manu-
facturing cost.

Generally speaking, if a car structure is sufﬁciently stiff in torsion, it will be
adequate in bending. Also, stresses in individual structural members during normal
driving conditions will be low. However, requirement 2 in the list above (i.e. to
maximise the fatigue life) remains a priority for the designer of the structure since
stress concentrations can lead to material cracking or even failure, particularly at
spot-welded or bolted connections. This fatigue mode of failure is considered in
Sect. 4.5 below. The third and ﬁnal requirement (i.e. to ensure the vehicle is
crashworthy) often causes conﬂicts because a strong, stiff structure may not possess
the necessary energy absorbing capabilities. Vehicle crashworthiness is the subject
of Sect. 4.4 of this chapter.

4.3.2 Methods of Analysis

4.3.2.1 Simple Bending Analysis

Whether the purpose of the analysis is to determine the torsional stiffness or the
stresses in the structure due to the applied loads, it is important to establish the load
path through the structure, i.e. how the loads are input to the structure and transmitted
from one member to the next. For example, for the analysis of static vertical loading,
the distribution of loads and centres of mass of major items, e.g. engine, passengers,
payload, etc., need to be determined or estimated. Usually the weight of the body shell,
that is the sprung weight, is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the length of the
vehicle. Then, assuming the vehicle to be simply supported at the wheels, the type of
load diagram shown in Fig. 4.8 can be constructed leading to derivation of the shear
force (SF) and bending moment (BM) diagrams as shown. It can be seen from these
diagrams that the maximum SF occurs at A and the maximum BM at B.

Note that the static loads are often multiplied by factors of 2 or 3 to allow for
dynamic effects as the vehicle traverses rough ground or hits obstacles in the road.
However this is very much a “rule of thumb” and more precise methods of esti-
mating the effect of dynamic loading are now available (see Sect. 4.5 below).

Once the maximum bending moment has been estimated, the maximum bending
stress in the case of a chassis framed vehicle can then readily be calculated from the
standard equation for a simple beam in bending:

r ¼ M (cid:1) y

I

ð4:2Þ

where
r is the maximum bending stress, which should be less than the design stress,
M is the applied bending moment,

is the second moment of area of the frame longitudinal member at that point y is
the maximum distance from the neutral axis of the longitudinal member to its
upper or lower surface.

For a vehicle of integral construction, the calculation is more complex because
many parts of the structure are involved in reacting the applied loads. As a ﬁrst
approximation, the bending moment can be assumed to be carried solely by the
sills, the longitudinal members usually of folded sheet steel construction which
the front and rear of the car underneath the doors. Even with this
connect
assumption, the calculations are not straightforward because the sill section is often
unsymmetrical and therefore subject to warping as well as bending. It should also
be remembered that the torsional stiffness of beam sections with longitudinal
cut-outs to allow for wiring runs e.t.c., is much reduced compared to that of the
corresponding fully closed section. The theory of unsymmetrical sections and open
sections in bending and/or torsion is outside the scope of the present book.

4.3.2.2 Simple Structural Surfaces (SSS) Method

An important concept in the design of integral structures is that of the shear panel.
This is an idealisation of the large, approximately ﬂat, thin steel panels used in the
construction of many vehicles such as vans. It is assumed that a shear panel
transmits load primarily by developing in-plane shear stresses due to shear forces
applied parallel to the edges of the panel. To illustrate how this concept works,
consider the simple box structure subject to a torsional
load, T as shown in
Fig. 4.9a. Free body diagrams can be drawn for each panel and the only loads

involved are assumed to be the shear forces, Qi acting at the panel edges as shown
in Fig. 4.9b. Then, for static equilibrium of the end, sides and top/bottom panels

and Q2, Q3 can then be found from equations Eqs. (4.6 and 4.7).

Note however that, if the top (roof) of the box structure is not present, then
Q1 = Q3 = 0 since there is nothing to react these shear forces on the top of the
structure. Therefore, by the principle of complementary shear, Q2 = 0. The shear
panel concept then falls down and the structure carries the torsional load by a
different mechanism (warping) and will be very much less stiff as a consequence.
This illustrates the difﬁculties that engineers are faced with when designing an
open-topped convertible car to have sufﬁcient torsional stiffness. Of course, prac-
tical vehicle structures are very much more complex than the above simple example
and the door frame structures (which can be idealised as simple beams) and even
the windscreen can add signiﬁcantly to the torsional stiffness of a vehicle.

4.3 Analysis of Car Body Structures

4.3.2.3 Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

It will be appreciated from the above general discussion that the analysis of vehicle
theoretical methods is complex and often very
structures using traditional
approximate in view of the number of simplifying assumptions that need to be
made. An alternative approach which has become almost universally adopted in the
industry is to use ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) to more accurately predict defor-
mations and stresses in vehicle structures. FEA essentially involves breaking the
structure down into a large number of non-overlapping small regions (“elements”).
The problem is formulated in terms of the “degrees of freedom” (usually dis-
placements) at certain discrete points known as “nodes” which always occur at
element vertices but may sometimes also be located elsewhere.

There are many different types of elements but the ones most commonly employed
in vehicle body structural analysis are beam and shell elements. Since both these
types only explicitly model the mid-surface of the structure, the section properties
(e.g. second moment of area, shell thickness) are speciﬁed separately. A beam ele-
ment model of a space-frame sports car chassis is shown in Fig. 4.10 whereas a basic
shell element model of a pick-up vehicle structure is shown in Fig. 4.11.

Note that in Fig. 4.10, the engine and ﬁnal drive have been modelled with solid
elements, the properties of which are calculated to give the correct mass distribu-
tion. The chassis members are modelled with beam elements, shown as straight
lines in Fig. 4.10, which have 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom at
each node. If the connections at the nodes can be considered to be pin-jointed, then
the members carry loads in tension/compression only. However, if the connections
are sufﬁciently reinforced to be considered rigid, the members can be subjected to
bending/torsion as well as tension/compression. In practice it usual to make the
rigid-joint assumption since this will generally overestimate the stiffness and the
stresses in the members and so lead to conservative (i.e. safe) designs.

The shell element model of the pick-up truck in Fig. 4.11 is actually derived for
a dynamic modal analysis of the body shell and is only indicative of the much more
detailed model that would typically be used for structural assessment. The front
windscreen is included because it does have a stiffening effect on both the static and

dynamic behaviour but the side windows and any sun-roof would normally be
excluded from a structural model as they may be open during critical manoeuvres.
Occasionally, full 3D solid elements are used in place of shells e.g. in the detailed
analysis of critical regions such as spot welded connections where stress concen-
trations may lead to early fatigue failures. Normally, isotropic linear elastic material
properties are assumed for steel or aluminium components (only Young’s modulus
and Poisson’s ratio required) but occasionally non-linear plasticity characteristics
will be speciﬁed in heavily stressed regions where the material may be subject to
plastic (permanent) deformation. Composite materials are more difﬁcult to analyse
because their properties are often anisotropic (different in different directions of
loading). Modern FEA packages have specialist composite material models avail-
able but it is outside the scope of the present book to describe these in detail.

4.4 Safety Under Impact

4.4.1 Legislation

The safety of vehicles can be divided into primary (sometimes called “active”) and
secondary (“passive”) safety. Primary safety involves the prevention of accidents
and collisions and is the concern of the designers of the suspension and braking
systems in particular e.g. advanced chassis control (ACC) and anti-lock braking
(ABS) are two systems which have been developed to improve primary safety.
Secondary safety is concerned with minimising the risk of injury to the vehicle
occupants and other road users in the event that an accident should occur. As such,
it is very much the responsibility of the vehicle structure designer to ensure that the

4.4 Safety Under Impact

231

vehicle has sufﬁcient energy absorbing capability and general “crashworthiness” to
meet the ever increasing legislation and customer-driven demands.

The most signiﬁcant

legislative codes affecting the international design of
vehicles are the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) which apply to
all vehicles sold in the USA and the various European Council (EC) directives on
vehicle safety which are mandatory for volume-produced vehicles sold in the EU.
Non-regulatory assessments also exist in many jurisdictions under the heading of
NCAPs (New Car Assessment Programmes). Although passing the various NCAP
tests is non-mandatory, obtaining good (ideally 5 star) ratings are important per-
formance targets for vehicle manufacturers.

There are many parts within these standards relating to occupant protection and
component design for frontal impact safety. The original and most well-known
requirement is contained in FMVSS 208 which speciﬁes a maximum allowable
deceleration of 60 g measured on anthropomorphic test dummies in frontal impacts
at 30 mph with a rigid wall at angles between 0° and 30° to the forward direction of
motion. This original requirement was criticised as being unrepresentative of true
crash situations and has been supplemented by tests involving a deformable barrier
(manufactured from aluminium honeycomb to represent the front-end stiffness of a
typical saloon car) and at various degrees of overlap (typically 40 or 60%) with the
front-end of the test vehicle. A computer simulation of such an offset barrier frontal
impact test is shown in Fig. 4.12.

232

4 Vehicle Structures and Materials

These offset deformable barrier tests also forms the basis of the current EU stan-
dards although the impact speed speciﬁed in Europe is 56 km/h. However the
requirement for a maximum deceleration of 60 g for any time period longer than 3 ms
as measured on instrumented dummies has remained the norm. As well as dummies
representing the average male driver, dummy tests are now also carried out for smaller
female and child occupants and in the rear as well as the front of the vehicle. Close
attention is paid to injury modes such as neck whiplash and lower leg injuries.

In addition to rigorous frontal impact requirements, side impacts are also the
subject of legislation. Here worst case tests tend to replicate the side of the vehicle
hitting a rigid pole rather than the deformable front end of another vehicle. Since
there is very little room for deformable energy absorbing devices in door structures,
stiff side impact beams are important
in protecting the occupant space from
excessive intrusion and close attention is paid to collisions between the dummy
(especially the head) and the surrounding interior structures.

Collisions between passenger cars and larger vehicles such as trucks has also
been the subject of much scrutiny and legislation. Trucks are now required to have
rear and side guards to prevent smaller vehicles “submarining” underneath the truck
chassis on impact with obvious dire consequences for the car passengers as men-
tioned in Sect. 4.1 above.

Finally, protection of pedestrians and other road users (e.g. cyclists) in the event
of a collision with a vehicle is now the subject of legislative standards and con-
sumer tests. Typically instrumented leg and head forms representing both adult and
child anatomy are launched at different angles against the bumper or bonnet
structures of the vehicle. Impact speeds are typically 35 km/h and potential injury is
assessed using standard injury criteria such as AIS and HIC. These tests have
required vehicle manufacturers to rethink the front end designs of their vehicles to
make them far less damaging to pedestrian impacts by removing sharp changes in
section and reducing the stiffness of components such as the bonnet which are likely
to be involved in the collision.

4.4.2 Overview of Frontal Impact

In the frontal impact of a vehicle whether with a barrier or another vehicle, the
worst case scenario is that all the initial kinetic energy of the vehicle on impact is
dissipated within the structure of that vehicle alone. If it is assumed that F is the
force to crush (plastically deform) the front end of the vehicle and s is the crush
distance, then a simple energy balance gives:

ZSf

0

F ds ¼ 1
2

mv2
0

ð4:9Þ

4.4 Safety Under Impact

233

where

m is the mass of the vehicle
v0
is the velocity on impact
sf
is the crush distance at the end of the impact (total front end deformation).

Now, if it is further assumed that the crush force is constant and known, then the

total crush distance is given by:

sf ¼ mv2
0
2F

ð4:10Þ

For example, if a vehicle of mass 1000 kg and crush strength 300 kN impacts a

rigid barrier at 50 km/h (13.9 m/s), the total amount of front-end crush is:
sf ¼ 1000 (cid:4) 13:92
2 (cid:4) 300 (cid:4) 103

¼ 0:32 m

The time duration of the impact, t, can be calculated from the momentum

equation:

F (cid:1) t ¼ mv0

ð4:11Þ

Giving for the above parameters: t ¼ 1000(cid:4)13:9
300(cid:4)103
The average deceleration of the vehicle to the rear of the crush zone can then be

¼ 0:046 s

calculated from the change in velocity divided by the impact time duration:

a ¼ 13:9
0:046
¼ 302 m
(cid:5) 30 g

(cid:2)

s2

The above equations clearly illustrate that a very strong front end structure will
give a short crush length and impact time duration and therefore a high deceleration.
In practice the situation for any real vehicle is far more complex than suggested
by the above equations. In particular, a vehicle absorbs energy by a variety of
mechanisms which include crushing, folding, buckling and frictional contact of a
number of discrete components within the vehicle structure. The front longitudinal
chassis rails in particular, along with other support structures, are designed to
absorb energy progressively as the impact load is transferred to the rear of the
vehicle (see Fig. 4.13).

Thus the crush strength is not a constant value as assumed above and the
deceleration time history (the “crash pulse” as it is known) is complex, as shown by
the representative sample in Fig. 4.14. Incidently this pulse only just meets the
standard criterion of a maximum deceleration at the occupant restraint position of
30 g for any time period greater than 3 ms.

Simple theoretical analysis will not predict such a complex response which
requires either a full scale crash test or advanced numerical simulation of the impact
event to be carried out. The former is extremely expensive and it is not easy to
investigate the complex interactions that occur within a vehicle structure or the
effect of changing certain parameters. The latter numerical approach to crashwor-
thiness assessment prior to ﬁnal impact testing of a vehicle has become the norm as
described in the case study presented in Sect. 4.4.4 below.

4.4.3 Energy Absorbing Devices and Crash Protection

Systems

An ideal energy absorbing (EA) for front-end crash protection has the dynamic
force-displacement (P-d) characteristics shown in Fig. 4.15.

Up to the critical load Pc, the deformation should be elastic, i.e. it should be
recovered completely on unloading from a relatively low load (low speed impact).
Once Pc is exceeded, the device should deform at constant load, progressively
absorbing the energy of impact and restricting the level of force transmitted to other
parts of the vehicle. The amount of energy absorbed is of course equal to the area
under the force-deﬂection (P-d) curve.

The front bumper of a passenger car is normally the ﬁrst component to be
impacted in a frontal collision. Bumper design has evolved from a simple steel
construction designed to protect the bodywork from small knocks towards the
complex polymer/foam/metal construction of modern bumper systems. Polymer
foams, or honeycomb cellular materials, are widely used as impact energy absorbers
in devices such as knee bolsters and side impact protection systems as well as for
bumpers. Although far from behaving in the ideal manner suggested by Fig. 4.15,
polymer foams have many desirable characteristics. They are light, corrosion
resistant, responsive to any direction of loading, recover completely when subject to
moderate loading below the foam yield stress and can be engineered to meet the
particular requirements by varying the density, type and form of the polymer
construction. Typical load-deﬂection curves for polymer foams of varying degrees
of porosity (% density of the solid polymer) are shown in Fig. 4.16.

It can be seen from Fig. 4.16 that after the initial elastic response and yield, the
load-deﬂection response becomes approximately linear again (linear strain hard-
ening). The response eventually stiffens as the pores in the cellular material are
ﬂattened. However, the energy absorption capabilities of the bumper system can be
extended by mounting the bumper on the front longitudinal chassis rails of the
vehicle by means of a controlled deformation structure. One such arrangement is
the concentric interference-ﬁtted “tube-within-tube” device shown in Fig. 4.17
which is amenable to theoretical analysis as outlined below.

The concentric “tube-within-tube” arrangement shown in Fig. 4.17 absorbs
energy both in plastically expanding the outer tube but also in overcoming friction
between the two tubes as they slide relative to one another. Thus, for small relative
movement dx, the energy absorbed, dE, is:

Furthermore:

shown in Fig. 4.19. Although this is not quite the ideal response as shown in
Fig. 4.15, the fact that the device can be reliably tuned, and even re-used if the
impact is not too severe, makes it a potentially useful means of limiting the force
transmitted from the bumper to the main vehicle structure.

4.4.4 Case Study: Crashworthiness of Small Spaceframe

Sports Car

As mentioned above, many small sports and racing cars employ a spaceframe in the
form of a strong and stiff tubular steel chassis. There is very limited scope within such
spaceframes for energy absorption by the large deformation of sheet steel body panels
which occurs in mass-produced integral body structures. Furthermore, for styling
reasons, it is often not considered possible to mount large bumpers or other forms of
external energy absorbing devices at the front of the vehicle. Meeting the crashwor-
thiness legislation is a major challenge for any such vehicle and the research described
below aimed to investigate the crashworthiness of a typical small spaceframe vehicle
using ﬁnite element simulation of the impact of the whole vehicle against a rigid
barrier as well as drop weight testing of individual components.

For most small sports/race cars, the wheels are external to the body and, in a frontal
impact, the front tyres very quickly came into contact with the barrier, unlike in a
normal passenger car where contact between the tyre and front wheel arch occurs
much later during the impact event. The overall response therefore depends very
much on the impact characteristics of the tyres as well as the wheels and suspension
system on which they are mounted. Much effort was devoted in the case study to
modelling the tyre and wheel in as realistic yet relatively simplistic manner as pos-
sible. This involved developing an air-bag model for the inﬂated tyre and using a
ﬁnite element model to simulate the experimental impact of the tyre and wheel against
a rigid block using a drop test carriage to house the assembly as indicated in Fig. 4.20.

The results were validated by comparison with instrumented drop tests on actual
sports car wheels and tyres, as indicated in Fig. 4.21. The force was measured by
means of a load cell within the impact anvil and the deﬂection of the outer tyre wall
by means of a high speed video camera. The agreement between test and simulation
was considered sufﬁciently close, especially with respect to energy absorbed by the
tyre, to use the model with conﬁdence for the full vehicle impact simulations which
are described below.

Apart from the tyres and wheels, the investigation concentrated on modelling the
impact deformation of the main spaceframe chassis members with either beam or

shell elements. Again the predicted results were validated by testing the dynamic
response of representative “pyramid” welded steel structures in a large drop test
facility. A comparison between the post-impact experimental and numerical shapes
for these simple pyramid structures is shown in Fig. 4.22. It was found that to
accurately model the plastic hinge formation and subsequent ovalisation of the
longitudinal steel tubes, it was necessary to have a much ﬁner mesh in the local area
of the hinge than the mesh indicated in Fig. 4.22.

The complete ﬁnite element model of a particular space-framed vehicle shown in
Fig. 4.23 makes extensive use of shell-type elements of sufﬁcient mesh density at
the front end of the vehicle. Elsewhere simple beam elements are used and the
model includes 3D representations of the engine and other heavy components in
order to obtain the correct mass distribution. A dynamic analysis using an explicit
ﬁnite element solver was carried out for this model at an impact velocity of 50 km/h
against a rigid barrier. This gave predictions of deformation as shown in Fig. 4.24
which agree well with the limited full car crash test results available. The predicted
deceleration time history, monitored at a point equivalent to the driver’s chest, has
the form shown in Fig. 4.25. The peak deceleration of 87 g is well in excess of the
usual limit of 60 g. The incorporation of EA devices such as described above, either
within the vehicle nose cone (light plastic structure not included in model) or as an
integral part of the chassis structure, was proposed as a potential means of
improving the frontal impact characteristics of the vehicle without affecting its
overall appearance.

Introduction

As discussed above, automotive structures and components rarely fail due to a
single application of loading, except of course when they are designed to do so such
as in impact crash scenarios. Instead structures and components may ultimately fail
over a prolonged service life due to the accumulation of fatigue damage coupled
with environmental effects such as corrosion and wear which reduce the load
carrying capacity of the material. The study of these long-term loading effects is
known as “durability assessment” and is considered an important part of the overall
structural reliability of the vehicle.

Experimental testing for durability is carried out in various ways:

(cid:129) in-service ﬁeld testing
(cid:129) accelerated proving ground tests
(cid:129) laboratory testing.

Field testing with instrumented vehicles is the most realistic form of testing but it
is very time-consuming and expensive. In fact, for a well-designed vehicle, no
failures should be generated in a reasonable timescale unless the vehicle is sub-
jected to extreme misuse load cases such as hitting kerbs or driving over severe
pot-holes. Nevertheless the local acceleration and strain data generated can be
useful in other more detailed forms of assessment.

244

4 Vehicle Structures and Materials

Proving ground tests normally involve driving the vehicle over special tracks
incorporating pavé (cobblestone-like) or corrugated surfaces. These are designed to
subject the vehicle to more extreme loading than would be the case on normal roads
and hence promote failures in a shorter time scale. Again the vehicle will usually be
instrumented with accelerometers and/or strain gauges at critical locations to pro-
vide useful data on loading conditions.

Finally,

laboratory testing is a means of

subjecting components and
sub-assemblies to realistic loading under carefully controlled conditions. For
example, 4 post dynamic test rigs can be used to load all 4 wheels stations of a
vehicle independently, as indicated in Fig. 4.26. Since the tests can be run con-
tinuously over an extended period, this can be a cost-effective and reasonably rapid
means of establishing the durability of automotive structures and components.
However the capital investment in test equipment is high and prototype parts and
assemblies must be available. This means that testing can only occur quite late in
the product design cycle and cannot therefore be used to inform or drive design
changes leading to improved solutions.

4.5.2 Virtual Proving Ground Approach

In order to bring more reliable and efﬁcient vehicles to the market place more
rapidly, it is highly desirable to substitute or supplement the above traditional
durability test methods with predictive software tools. This has led to the concept of
a Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) in which computer modelling techniques replace
physical tests. Such an approach should enable alternative designs to be assessed far
earlier in the product life cycle than previously leading to more efﬁcient and novel
solutions being generated. As well as being more cost effective, this could also pave
the way for more automated and optimised design methods which may replace
some of the reliance on the accumulated experience of previous generations of
engineers and/or tried-and-tested solutions.

4.5 Durability Assessment

245

The heart of any VPG approach to durability assessment is accurate fatigue data
for the material or component under consideration, usually in the form of the classic
S-N curve where S is the stress (or strain) amplitude and N is the number of load
cycles before failure. The relationship should ideally contain design factors to allow
for the variability of raw fatigue data and for environmental effects such as the
presence of a corrosive environment (e.g. salt water in winter). Also required are
robust and accurate algorithms for assessing the equivalent fatigue life under
complex dynamic loading conditions and multi-axial stress states. Fortunately
sophisticated fatigue analysis software to carry out this complicated assessment is
now available as part of established CAE systems or as stand-alone packages.

Assuming that suitable fatigue data and analysis routines are available, the next
problem is to obtain appropriately detailed stress distributions for input to the
fatigue software. As discussed above, modern ﬁnite element methods are capable of
analysing stresses and strains in general 3D structures under almost any complexity
of loading conditions. The question is how complex does the analysis have to be, as
increasing complexity invariably means more expense and time delay. Ideally one
would like to make use of linear static stress analysis results but there are limits to
the applicability of such data, as discussed in the Case Study below. It may also be
possible to make use of a frequency domain approach to account for the dynamic
response of the structures considered. The alternative is to carry out a full dynamic
transient analysis for a typical time history of loading input to the vehicle. By its
very nature, this will be computationally intensive but also by deﬁnition will pro-
duce the most accurate results.

Whichever form of ﬁnite element stress analysis is undertaken, it is necessary to
have detailed knowledge of the input loads from the road surface or any other source
that give rise to the stresses in the individual components of the assembly or
structure. Such data can be generated from in-service or proving ground tests but as
discussed above, such tests are time-consuming and require a prototype vehicle to be
available. An alternative approach is to use multi-body dynamics (MBD) simulation
of the whole or part of the vehicle as it travels over typical road surfaces in order to
generate loading data at particularly critical locations. Although MBD software is
now readily available, many issues remain concerning its accurate and effective use
such as whether a quarter or full car model is required and what type of tyre model to
specify for each application.

Assuming that the above software elements are satisfactorily developed and
integrated so that accurate estimates of fatigue life distribution throughout the
structure/component can be made, there remains the possibility of using these life
distributions to automatically modify the designs leading to a more optimal solution
in terms of weight and/or efﬁcient use of material. Although structural optimisation
routines do exist in some FEA packages, it is fair to say that they are not yet
routinely used in the automotive industry due to their limited applicability to real
structures subjected to dynamic loading conditions. This is particularly true for the
design of components and structures whose primary failure mode is likely to be
fatigue due to complex loading rather than from a single load application. The
the powerful
extension of existing optimisation methods and,

in particular,

technique of Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) to this class of problem is
presented in the case study that follows.

4.5.3 Case Study: Durability Assessment and Optimisation

of Suspension Component

The component under consideration is the lower arm from the front suspension of a
multi-purpose vehicle as shown in Fig. 4.27. A more detailed view of the existing
design of arm is shown in Fig. 4.28. It can be seen that the arm has a number of

interfaces to other components of the suspension. In fact, a total of 19 external load
histories can be identiﬁed to act in the 3 co-ordinate directions at these interfaces. In
addition, there are 9 internal load histories due to the inertia of the arm and its
accelerations in 3D space to be considered. Thus the complete loading on the arm is
extremely complex and difﬁcult to quantify.

In order to estimate these loads using a VPG approach, MBD models were
created and driven over a virtual version of a particular pavé durability track as
indicated in Fig. 4.29. Experimental results were also generated by driving an
actual vehicle with accelerometers attached at critical locations over the physical
pavé test track.

Although quarter vehicle models (QVM) were tried, Fig. 4.29a, it was found
necessary to allow for body roll/pitch by moving to a full vehicle model (FVM),

loading histories.

Comparisons between the accelerations at the front wheel hub predicted by the full
vehicle model and the experimentally measured accelerations are shown in the Power
Spectral Density (PSD) plots of Fig. 4.30. It can be seen that both the amplitude and
frequency content of the experimental lateral and vertical accelerations of the hub are
well characterised by the FVM results which gave conﬁdence that this model could be
used for the subsequent design optimisation studies.

Having established the external and internal inertial loading histories applied to
the component of interest (the lower suspension arm), the next stage is to carry out a
detailed 3D FE analysis of the arm to predict stresses for the subsequent fatigue
assessment. Here the user is faced with a choice of at least three different analysis
strategies as indicated in Fig. 4.31.

4.5 Durability Assessment

249

Fig. 4.32 PSD of forcing function compared with arm natural frequency response

The quasi-static analysis strategy requires a single linear static analysis of the
arm for unit loading applied in each of the 19 external and 9 internal load directions
identiﬁed. Using the principle of superposition, the detailed stress history distri-
bution of the arm can then be obtained by factoring and summing the inﬂuence
coefﬁcients generated by each analysis according to the actual external load his-
tories applied. Although this is the simplest and most economical of the available
methods, it was found to be accurate only if the natural frequencies of the arm
(which can be readily predicted from the FE model) are well separated from the
frequency content of the forcing function input, as indicated in Fig. 4.32a.

If the frequencies are not separated by a factor of at least seven then the
quasi-static method was found to be highly erroneous because it does not account
for the interactions between the dynamic response of the component and the forcing
frequencies, potentially leading to resonance effects.

If the component and loading frequencies are separated by a factor of less than
seven as in Fig. 4.32b, then recourse must be made to the computationally accurate
but time consuming transient stress analysis method which requires full integration
and solution of the dynamic FE model at small time increments for the complete
loading time history considered. Such a computationally intensive method is not
suitable for the multiple simulations required for design optimisation based on
fatigue life even with the power of modern computer systems.

Finally, if the forcing function and component natural frequencies overlap as in
Fig. 4.33c, it may be possible to use harmonic stress analysis techniques followed by
frequency domain life assessment to estimate the fatigue life distribution in the
component. Here, the arm transfer functions which give the stresses per unit load as a
function of frequency are ﬁrstly generated by applying either full or reduced modal
superposition techniques. The transfer functions are then multiplied by the PSD’s of
the applied loads to give the equivalent PSD’s of stress. Finally, the fatigue life can
be estimated in the frequency domain using the well-established Dirlik approach.

When using the harmonic stress analysis method,

there are a number of
parameters that have to be speciﬁed such as the number of modes to include in the
harmonic analysis, the buffer size used to perform the Fast Fourier Transform

(FFT) to generate the loading PSD’s and the frequency step size used to derive the
stress PSD’s. Although the values of these parameters have been shown to affect the
absolute fatigue lives predicted using this method, the distribution of fatigue life
within the component is much less sensitive and is in good agreement with the
predictions of the most accurate transient stress analysis method. Since optimisation
of the design based on fatigue life depends on the distribution rather than absolute
values of life, the harmonic stress analysis method can therefore be used for this
purpose for cases where the forcing and natural frequencies coincide as in
Fig. 4.32c. This is far more computationally efﬁcient than using the full transient
analysis method.

A basic optimisation strategy based on fatigue life is shown in Fig. 4.33. An
immediate problem arises when attempting to implement such a strategy using
standard S-N fatigue data in that a fatigue cut-off limit at around 108 cycles is
usually speciﬁed due to the lack of data for higher numbers of cycles. This means
that the majority of material in most automotive components will be predicted to
have inﬁnite fatigue life. Since the optimisation algorithm seeks to remove material
with maximum life, a distribution which varies throughout the component is really
required so that the algorithm can start to remove material at the location with the
least damage. A practical solution to this problem is to artiﬁcially extend the fatigue
life cut-off point much further along the life axis, as indicated in Fig. 4.34. The fact
that the fatigue curve beyond the standard cut-off limit may not be completely
accurate is irrelevant in terms of the optimisation strategy because material with
such very long predicted life will be rapidly removed from the model.

To demonstrate the potential of this optimisation strategy to not only modify
existing designs but to generate radical new solutions, the maximum initial domain
of the lower suspension arm in question was established as a simple rectangular

block, Fig. 4.35. Since it is necessary to have certain features (principally mounting
holes) at certain locations in the arm, these features were designated as non-design
domains which could not be altered by the optimisation routine.

Figure 4.36a shows that the initial fatigue assessment of the design domain
before modifying the fatigue cut-off limit predicts inﬁnite life for most of the
material. In contrast, Fig. 4.36b shows the corresponding life contours after the
limit was raised to 1020 cycles.

Starting from the much more informative life distribution shown in Fig. 4.36b,
the optimisation routine was run with the objective of minimising the weight of the
arm subject to the constraint that at least 10,000 driving cycles over the pavé

history of material removal recorded during this optimisation process.

After about 80 loops of the algorithm shown in Fig. 4.33, the volume of the arm
was stabilised at less than 20% of its initial value with the resulting shape and

fatigue distribution as shown in Fig. 4.38. The optimised arm has a fatigue life of
36,000 cycles of the pavé durability track compared to only 173 cycles for the
existing arm design shown in Fig. 4.27. Simultaneously the weight of the optimised
arm has been reduced by 0.5 kg compared with the original design.

Of course, the jagged surfaces created by the particular ﬁnite element mesh of the
optimised arm shown in Fig. 4.38 are neither desirable nor practical to manufacture.
Therefore the ﬁnal stage of the process was to smooth these surfaces to create the
ﬁnal optimised geometry shown in Fig. 4.39. Although somewhat more complicated
to manufacture, this optimised component uses signiﬁcantly less material than the
original design shown in Fig. 4.28 and would have a fatigue life even greater than

predicted for the “jagged” ﬁnite element model shown in Fig. 4.38 because of the
reduction of stress concentrations.

Although the optimisation process is unquestionably complex, the exercise does
indicate the potential of computerised tools and the Virtual Proving Ground
approach to not only optimise existing designs but also to generate novel solutions
such as shown in Fig. 4.38, which are unlikely to emerge from traditional design,
make and test practices. Such novel solutions also lend themselves to additive
manufacturing technologies which have fewer constraints on the part geometry than
conventional manufacturing processes.

4.6 Concluding Remarks

This chapter has covered some of the more important aspects concerning the design
and analysis of chassis structures. The consideration of alternative high strength
lightweight materials has been included because they have started to revolutionise
the ways that vehicle body structures are designed and fabricated. Although
advanced computer analysis methods have become the norm in the industry for
both static and dynamic assessment of structures (including their durability and
crash safety), it is important that the engineers understand the basic principles and
can, from time to time, apply conventional methods of analysis as a reality check on
computerised solutions.

Chapter 5
Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Abstract This chapter aims to provide chassis engineers with knowledge of the
background theory and techniques so that they can make informed judgements on
NVH solution strategies at an early stage of vehicle development. The chapter
commences with a review of the fundamentals of acoustic theory as this topic is
often not covered in detail in Bachelor level engineering programmes. The human
response to sound is then outlined followed by a description of general noise
measurement and control techniques. The main sources of noise in road vehicles are
then reviewed and common assessment and mitigation techniques are outlined for
each type of noise. The next section introduces the sources and nature of auto-
motive mechanical vibration as distinct from air-borne noise. There is a focus on
vibration arising from the internal combustion engine since this remains the pre-
dominant motive power source for the majority of road vehicles. Principles of
vibration control are then described with a focus on vibration absorbers and the
isolation of engine-induced vibration. The ﬁnal section of the chapter deals with the
particular problems of brake noise and vibration, the latter affecting not only the
brake itself but also the entire chassis due to transmission of the vibration through
the suspension and steering systems.

5.1

Introduction to NVH

Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have become increasingly important factors
in vehicle design as a result of the quest for increased reﬁnement. Vibration has
always been an important issue closely related to reliability and quality, while noise
is of increasing importance to vehicle users and environmentalists. Harshness,
which is related to the quality and transient nature of vibration and noise, is also
strongly linked to vehicle reﬁnement.

Controlling vibration and noise in vehicles poses a severe challenge to the
designer because unlike many machine systems, road vehicles have a number of
sources of vibration and noise that are inter-related and speed dependent. In recent
years, the trend towards lighter vehicle constructions and higher engine speeds has
Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

exacerbated NVH problems in conventional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles. Moreover the advent of electric and hybrid electric vehicles has tended to
increase the potential for noise and vibration from non-engine sources, posing many
new problems for automotive engineers. These developments have also coincided
with a reduction in the time to market for new vehicles which has created an
increased reliance on computer-aided design and analysis with less time spent on
prototype testing.

This accelerated development of new and highly reﬁned vehicles is dependent
on accurate dynamic analysis of vehicles and their subsystems and calls for reﬁned
mathematical modelling and analytical techniques. While NVH analysis has in
recent years been aided by developments in ﬁnite element and multi-body systems
analysis software, there is still an underlying need to apply basic vibration and noise
principles in vehicle design.

It is the objective of this chapter to address some important noise and vibration
issues arising in vehicle design. It is assumed that the reader has some previous
knowledge of noise and vibration theory but not necessarily of acoustics; hence the
ﬁrst part of the chapter presents a brief review of the fundamentals of acoustic
theory.

5.2 Fundamentals of Acoustics

An understanding of acoustic fundamentals is essential in controlling noise and
interpreting noise criteria. This section outlines some of the basic principles of
sound propagation.

5.2.1 General Sound Propagation

Sound is transmitted from a source to a receiver by an elastic medium called the
path. In an automotive context, this is the surrounding air or the vehicle body
structure, the latter giving rise to the term structure-borne sound.

The simplest form of sound propagation occurs when a small sphere pulsates
harmonically in free space (away from any bounding surfaces). The vibrating
surface of the sphere causes the air molecules in contact with it to vibrate and this
vibration is transmitted radially outwards to adjoining air molecules. This produces
a propagating (or travelling) wave having a characteristic velocity c, i.e. the velocity
of sound in air. At some arbitrary point on the path, the air undergoes pressure
ﬂuctuations that are superimposed on the ambient pressure. A sound source
vibrating at a frequency f, produces sound at this frequency. Taking a snapshot of
the instantaneous pressure and traversing away from the source, the variation of
pressure with distance is also sinusoidal. The distance between pressure peaks is
constant and known as the wavelength k. This is related to c and f by the equation:

5.2 Fundamentals of Acoustics

k ¼ c
f

This equation shows that as f increases, k decreases (since c is constant for given
atmospheric conditions). In the audible range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, the wave-
length correspondingly varies from 17 m to 17 mm.

5.2.2 Plane Wave Propagation

The fundamentals of wave motion are most easily understood by considering the
propagation of a plane wave (having a ﬂat wavefront perpendicular to the direction
of propagation). Denoting the elastic deformation as n at some distance x from a
ﬁxed datum and combining the continuity and momentum equations for the element
with the universal gas law leads to the one dimensional wave equation:

The propagation velocity c, is given by:

where p = the ambient pressure, q = corresponding density of
the medium,
c = ratio of speciﬁc heats for air, R = universal gas constant and T = absolute
temperature. For air at standard atmospheric pressure and 20 °C, the magnitude of c
is 343 m/s.

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side represents the incident wave (travelling
away from the source) while the second term represents the reﬂected wave (trav-
elling in the opposite direction). The wave number is given by k ¼ x

k and hence is deﬁned as the number of acoustic wavelengths in 2p. The values of
2 p
c vary considerably for ﬂuid and solid materials. Some typical values are shown in
Table 5.1. For the solid materials, the speeds shown are for one dimensional stress
waves rather than acoustic waves.

5.2.3 Acoustic Impedance, z

The impedance to the propagation of an acoustic wave is called the acoustic
impedance. It is deﬁned as the ratio of the acoustic pressure p to the particle
velocity u. It can be shown that:

z ¼ p

For standard air pressure and temperature (101.3 kPa and 20 °C), z is equal to

per unit area normal to the wavefront. It is given by:

5.2.5 Spherical Wave Propagation—Acoustic

Spherical waves more closely ressemble true source waves, but approximate to
plane waves at large distances from a source. It may be shown that the wave
equation in spherical coordinates is:

where r is the radial distance from the source.

At large distances from the source ðkr (cid:3) 1 or r (cid:3) k=2pÞ, z ! qc. Here the
pressure and particle velocity are in phase and this corresponds to a region called
the acoustic far ﬁeld where spherical wavefronts approximate to those of plane
waves.

At distances close to the source ðkr (cid:4) 1 or r (cid:4) k=2pÞ, z ! iqckr. Here pressure

and velocity are 90° out of phase. This region is called the acoustic near ﬁeld.

The transition from near to far ﬁeld is in reality a gradual one but the demar-
cation can be taken to be at kr = 10. Since k = 2 p/k, the demarcation is given
approximately by: r (cid:5) 1:6 k. For a harmonic wave in air at 1 kHz (k (cid:5) 0:3 m),
r = 500 mm; while at 20 Hz (k (cid:5) 17 m), r = 27.5 m. The far ﬁeld/near ﬁeld
transition has important implications for microphone positioning in sound level
measurements.

5.2.6 Reference Quantities

Certain reference quantities are used for sound emission measurements. For sound
transmission in air, the reference r.m.s. pressure is taken to be pref = 20 lPa which

260

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

corresponds approximately to the threshold of hearing at the reference frequency of
1 kHz. With a reference impedance zref = (q c)ref = 400 rayls,
the reference
intensity Iref = 10−12 W/m2 from Eq. (5.6). Since the acoustic power is the intensity
times the area, for a reference spherical area Aref = 1 m2, the reference sound power
is 10−12 W.

5.2.7 Acoustic Quantities Expressed in Decibel Form

The human ear is capable of detecting acoustic quantities over a very wide range,
e.g. pressure variations from 20 lPa to 100 Pa. Hence there is a need to represent
acoustic data in a convenient form. This is achieved by using the decibel scale. The
quantity of interest x is expressed in the form 10 log10(x/xref), where both x and xref
have units of power. Using the above reference quantities the sound power level
(LW), the sound intensity level (LI) and the sound pressure level (Lp) in decibels
(dB) are as follows:

When it is noted that the threshold of hearing corresponds to a sound pressure
it may be shown that for standard temperature and pressure

level of 0 dB,
(101.3 kPa and 20 °C), LW, LI and Lp in dB are related as follows:

where rref = 0.282 m for the reference spherical area Aref = 1 m2.

From Eq. (5.14), it is seen that Lp and LI are approximately equal numerically,
while Eq. (5.15) is useful for determining the sound power level of an acoustic
source from sound pressure level measurements in free ﬁeld conditions. For these
whole ﬁeld radiation conditions, the reduction in sound pressure level with every
doubling of radial distance from the source is 6 dB.

It is often necessary to determine the sound pressure level of two or more uncor-
related sound sources when the level for each source is known. This can be

5.2.9 Effects of Reﬂecting Surfaces on Sound Propagation

When an incident wave strikes a reﬂecting surface, the wave is reﬂected back
towards the source. In the vicinity of the reﬂecting surface, the incident and
reﬂected waves interact to produce what is known as a reverberant ﬁeld. The depth
of this ﬁeld is dependent on the absorptive properties of the reﬂecting surface.
A typical interaction between incident and reﬂected waves is shown in Fig. 5.1 and
sound pressure level variations as function of distance “r” from the sound source are
as shown in Fig. 5.2.

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Various practical situations arise when the sound source is positioned close to a

hard reﬂecting surface. The following are idealised situations:
(cid:129) Whole-space radiation—when there are no reﬂecting surfaces, i.e. the source is

in free space.

(cid:129) Half-space radiation—when the source is at the centre of a ﬂat hard (reﬂecting)

surface, e.g. the sound source is on a ﬂoor.

(cid:129) Quarter space radiation—when the source is at the intersection of two ﬂat hard
surfaces which are perpendicular to one another, e.g. the sound source is on a
ﬂoor next to a wall.

(cid:129) Eighth space radiation—when the source is positioned at the intersection of
three ﬂat perpendicular hard surfaces, e.g. the sound source is in a corner.
Increasing the number and proximity of reﬂecting surfaces to a source increases
the acoustic intensity. The situations described above can be represented by the
directivity index DI expressed in terms of the directivity factor Q:

DI ¼ 10 log10 Q

ð5:17Þ

(cid:129) For a whole space Q = 1 (DI = 0 dB)
(cid:129) For a half space Q = 2 (DI = 3 dB)
(cid:129) For a quarter space Q = 4 (DI = 6 dB)
(cid:129) For an eighth space Q = 8 (DI = 9 dB).

The sound power level (PWL) of a source located in any of the positions
described above can be calculated from sound pressure level (SPL) measurements

5.2.10 Sound in Enclosures (Vehicle Interiors)

The air inside the enclosed volume of a vehicle cabin behaves as an elastic ﬂuid and
consequently has a number of natural frequencies and modes (standing waves). For
a simple rectangular box, these frequencies and mode shapes can be readily cal-
culated. However, the cabin space of a typical saloon car is far more complex in
shape e.g. there are intrusions such as seats and there are numerous types of surface
having different (acoustic) absorption characteristics. These make the acoustic
natural frequencies and modes extremely difﬁcult to determine.

Unlike the case of a ﬁxed volume of air inside a rigid enclosure, the bounding
surfaces of a typical saloon car cabin also vibrate, resulting in a complex distributed
source of excitation for the enclosed air and producing ﬂuid-structure interactions.

5.2 Fundamentals of Acoustics

263

Nevertheless, it is possible for standing waves to be excited in the cabin under
certain conditions. The result is a booming effect. Ideally the driver and passengers
should be located at the stationary nodes (points of low SPL) of the standing waves.
In practice, boom effects tend to be at low frequencies and can be limited by careful
body design and control of structure/airborne noise transmission.

In general the sound ﬁeld within a cabin space will be diffuse. The central region of
the cabin space will tend to be reverberant while regions close to the vibrating surfaces
which generate acoustic pressure waves will tend to be in the direct sound ﬁeld.

In practice there are a number of sound sources emitting noise into vehicle
interiors and these can produce discrete components which are superimposed on a
lower level of broadband noise. This situation is discussed in more detail in
Sect. 5.7.3.

5.3 Subjective Response to Sound

Just as the human body responds differently to vibration excitation at different
frequencies, so does the human ear respond differently to sound at different fre-
quencies. Whereas human response to vibration is assessed by weighting the
acceleration applied to the body as described in Chap. 3, it is shown below that
human response to noise can be assessed by appropriately weighting the SPL. This
weighting is derived from an understanding of human response to sound.

5.3.1 The Hearing Mechanism and Human Response

Characteristics

The human ear is a delicate and sophisticated device for detecting and amplifying
sound. It consists of an outer ear, a middle ear containing an amplifying device (the
ossicles) and an inner ear containing the cochlea. This small snail shape element
contains lymph nodes and a coiled membrane to which are connected thousands of
very sensitive hair endings of varying thickness. These respond to different fre-
quencies, converting the sound stimulus into nerve impulses that are transmitted to
the brain. A certain threshold level is required to stimulate the nerve cells, while
over-stimulation can lead to temporary or permanent deafness. This latter effect was
recognised in the last century as a cause of industrial deafness resulting in a number
of regulations to protect workers.

The audible range for a healthy young person lies within the envelope shown in
Fig. 5.3. The frequency range extends from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and the SPL extends
from the threshold of hearing at the lower boundary to the threshold of feeling
(pain) at the upper boundary. The SPL at the upper and lower boundaries vary
markedly with frequency. At 1 kHz, the SPL ranges from 0 dB at the lower
boundary to 130 dB at the upper boundary. The shapes of the curves for sounds of

increasing loudness are generally similar to that for the threshold of hearing. It
follows therefore that the human ear is most sensitive between 500 Hz and 5 kHz
and is relatively insensitive to sounds below 100 Hz. This characteristic shape
dictates the A-weighting characteristic that is used to assess human response to
noise (see Fig. 5.4).

5.4 Sound Measurement

Automotive noise measurement is required for a variety of purposes dictating the
need for a range of measuring equipment. In development work there is a
requirement for measuring continuous noise levels such as that from drive-trains
and their ancillaries; there are also requirements for component noise testing to
determine sound power output, frequency analysis and source identiﬁcation. For
type approval there are requirements for assessing whole vehicle noise. Controlled
test environments are also required to ensure that tests are repeatable and not
weather dependent. This requirement is met by special test facilities, such as ane-
choic chambers, that simulate free-ﬁeld environments.

5.4.1

Instrumentation for Sound Measurement

5.4.1.1 Sound Pressure Level (SPL) Meter

This is the most basic instrument for sound measurement. It comprises a micro-
phone, r.m.s. SPL calculator with fast and slow time constants, and an A-weighting

algorithm to relate the measurements made to the human audible response to give
the so-called A-weighted noise level LpA expressed in dB(A). Because of the
frequency sensitivity of the human ear, the A-weighting network has the form
shown in Fig. 5.4. This emphasises the frequencies in the 500 Hz to 5 kHz range
and produces increasing levels of attenuation below 100 Hz.

British and other standards specify four quality grades of SPL meter ranging
from Type 0 laboratory reference meters to Type 3 industrial grade meters. For
development work, Type 1 instruments are generally recommended. If the instru-
ment is required for measurement of transient noise, it should also be equipped with
a peak record facility.

Because sound levels are rarely constant (e.g. noise resulting from changes in
engine speed), there is a need to average levels over prescribed intervals of time. This
type of measurement leads to an equivalent noise level such as LAeq, T, which is
related to noise deafness and annoyance criteria. Here the A-weighted noise level is
averaged over a measurement period T to give a level having the same energy content
as a constant sound of the same numerical SPL. Mathematically this can be written:

Another requirement of SPL meters is to determine the level that has been
exceeded for a prescribed portion of the measurement time, LN, e.g. LA90 represents
the A-weighted level exceeded for 90% of the measurement period and is used in
environmental background noise measurements associated with trafﬁc noise.

266

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

5.4.1.2 Sound Intensity Analysers

Sound intensity analysers allow sound power measurements to be made in situ in the
presence of background noise i.e. they do not require special noise testing instal-
lations. They also allow noise source identiﬁcation from sound intensity mapping.
A typical sound intensity probe consists of two closely spaced pressure micro-
phones that measure the sound pressure and the pressure gradient between the two
microphones. Signal processing converts these measurements into sound intensity
values in a sound intensity analyser.

5.4.1.3 Frequency Analysers

Since the frequency spectrum of noise is closely related to the origins of its pro-
duction, experimental frequency analysis is a powerful tool for identifying noise
sources and assessing the effectiveness of noise control measures.

The simplest frequency analysers split the frequency range into a set of octave
bands having the following standardised centre frequencies: 31.5, 63, 125, 250,
500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 16,000 Hz. These ﬁlters have a constant per-
centage bandwidth implying that the bandwidth increases with centre frequency
giving increasingly poor discrimination at high frequencies. This can be improved
with the use of third octave analysis. A number of noise and environmental stan-
dards require the use of octave and third octave analysis and much of the perfor-
mance data for noise control products is expressed in terms of octave band centre
frequencies.

For serious noise control investigations, narrow band frequency analysers are a
necessity. Instead of switching sequentially through a set of ﬁlters, the signal in a
narrow band analyser is recorded simultaneously to all the ﬁlters in the analysis range.

5.5 General Noise Control Techniques

Sound is produced by air molecules being excited either by a vibrating surface or by
changes in pressure in ﬂuid systems. Noise control techniques are based on one or
more of the following principles:
(cid:129) Control the noise at source—this involves a deep understanding of the noise

generation process

(cid:129) Modify the acoustic environment—this relates to sound in enclosures and aims

to make the environment less reverberent

(cid:129) Use sound barriers and enclosures—the aim is to limit the transmission of

airborne sound

(cid:129) Use vibration damping treatments—the aim is to attenuate the amplitude of

vibrating surface and hence reduce the level of the noise generated.

5.5 General Noise Control Techniques

267

5.5.1 Sound Energy Absorption

Absorption is one of the most important factors affecting the acoustic environment in
enclosures. Increasing the average absorption of internal surfaces is a relatively inex-
pensive way of reducing sound levels in enclosures and is effective in vehicle interiors.
Absorption coefﬁcient a, is deﬁned as the ratio of sound energy absorbed by a
surface to the sound energy incident on it. Its value is dependent on the angle of
incidence and since in an enclosure all angles of incidence are possible, the values
of a are averaged for a wide range of angles. Absorption is also dependent on
frequency and published data normally quotes values at the standard octave-band
centre frequencies.

For an enclosure having a number of different internal surface materials, the

average absorption coefﬁcient a can be determined (for n surfaces) from:

a ¼

P
n
i¼1 Siai
P
n
i¼1 Si

ð5:20Þ

where Si = surface area, ai = absorption coefﬁcient for the ith surface.

In general, materials having high levels of absorption are porous so that
movement of air molecules is restricted by the ﬂow resistance of the pores.
Absorption coefﬁcients for a typical range of materials can be found in the literature
or on company web-sites.

5.5.2 Sound Transmission Through Barriers

One of the principal noise transmission paths in a vehicle is through the bulkhead
separating the cabin space from the engine compartment. The bulkhead can be
considered to be a sound barrier. The effectiveness of sound barriers is normally
quoted in terms of transmission loss TL. This is the ratio of the incident sound
energy to that of the transmitted sound energy, expressed in dB. For a thin
homogeneous barrier and random angle of incidence (in the range from 0° to 72°),
it can be shown that the ﬁeld incidence transmission loss in dB is given by:

TL ¼ 20 log10 f mð

Þ (cid:2) 47

ð5:21Þ

where f is the frequency of the sound in Hz and m is the mass per unit area of the
barrier in kg/m2.

268

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Fig. 5.5 Transmission loss as a function of frequency
(http://personal.inet.ﬁ/koti/juhladude/pics/theory/transmission_loss.gif)

Equation (5.21) applies to what is called the mass-controlled frequency region
(Fig. 5.5) in which the transmission loss increases by 6 dB per octave increase in
frequency. Alternatively doubling the barrier thickness or density increases trans-
mission loss by 6 dB at a given frequency. It is evident from this that an effective
means of
increasing transmission loss in this frequency range is to use a
high-density material for acoustic barriers.

frequency fc,

Sound transmission through barriers is governed at low frequencies by panel
bending stiffness and panel resonances, see Fig. 5.5. These tend to reduce the low
frequency effectiveness by varying amounts dependent on the resonant frequency
and amount of damping. Above twice the lowest natural frequency and below a
critical
the barrier effectiveness can be considered to be
mass-controlled. The critical frequency is related to the ability of the incident sound
on a barrier to be transmitted as bending waves. It occurs when the wavelength of
the incident wave coincides with the bending mode wavelength of the barrier kB.
The lowest frequency at which this can occur is when the incident sound grazes the
surface of the barrier at almost zero incidence angle in which case the critical or
coincidence frequency is given by:

fc ¼ c
kB

ð5:22Þ

In practice the range of incidence angles varies from zero to a little less than 90°
which means that the decrease in transmission loss associated with coincidence
occurs at a frequency somewhat higher than the value given by Eq. (5.22). The
effectiveness of barriers is also sharply reduced by even the smallest apertures and

5.5 General Noise Control Techniques

269

can pose problems in noise isolation when electrical trunking and pipework is
required to run between the engine and cabin compartments.

In practice layered materials consisting of a dense core and surface layers of
absorptive material can perform the dual role of providing sound absorption with a
high transmission loss.

5.5.3 Damping Treatments

Damping treatments (in the form of high damping polymers) can be used to limit
resonant response amplitudes in structures and are particularly effective for ﬂexural
vibration of panels and beams. In an automotive context they are used extensively
to limit the resonant responses of body panels and bulkheads.

Because of the poor structural strength of high damping polymers, it is necessary
to either bond them to the surface of load-bearing elements or to incorporate them
into load-bearing elements by sandwich construction. These forms of damping are
termed unconstrained- and constrained-layer damping respectively, with the latter
being by far the most effective way of deploying this type of structural damping
treatment. Flexing of the load-bearing element produces shearing effects in the
damping layer and thus vibrational energy is converted into heat and dissipated.
Shear properties of polymer materials are generally temperature and frequency
dependent. Furthermore their use in the form of constrained layer damping poses
problems with bending and forming in manufacturing processes.

5.6 Automotive Noise—Sources and Control

The frequency composition of a sound is one of its most identiﬁable features. When
the sound occurs at a single frequency it is called a pure tone. However, the great
majority of sounds are far more complicated than this, having frequency compo-
nents distributed across the audible range. Because there are number of sources of
automotive noise, most of which are cyclic and at different frequencies, the result is
what is called broad band noise. For internal combustion engine vehicles, the noise
usually contains a number of dominant frequency components related to engine
speed. The frequency characteristics of noise are represented by its frequency
spectrum in a similar way to those for vibration sources.

5.6.1

Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Noise

ICE noise originates from both the combustion process and the mechanical forces
associated with the engine dynamics. The combustion process produces large

270

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

pressure ﬂuctuations in each cylinder and these produce high dynamic gas loads
and other mechanical forces such as piston slap. These forces combine with the
dynamic forces from inertia and unbalance effects (which are generally dependent
on engine conﬁguration and speed) forming the excitations applied to the engine
structure. The resulting vibration produces noise radiation from the various surfaces
of the engine.

Noise control at source therefore has to be concerned with controlling the extent
of cylinder pressure variations (associated with combustion noise) and the choice of
engine conﬁguration (associated with mechanical effects). Both of these options
tend to conﬂict with the modern trend for small high-speed fuel-efﬁcient engines. In
the case of diesel engines, there is evidence that combustion force reduction can be
achieved by controlling the rate of pressure rise in the engine cylinders. This
requires careful attention to the design of combustion bowls and the selection of
turbocharger and fuel injection options. The mechanical noise associated with
piston slap can be reduced by careful choice of gudgeon-pin offset and minimising
piston mass.

By ranking the components of engine noise, it has been found that most noise is
radiated from the larger more ﬂexible surfaces such as sumps, timing case covers,
crankshaft pulleys and induction manifolds. It therefore makes sense to isolate these
components from the vibration that is generated in engine blocks. This can be
achieved by using specially designed seals and isolating studs. Noise shields can
also be effective in attenuating radiated noise from components such as timing case
covers and the side-walls of engine blocks. The shields are generally made from
laminated steel (see Sect. 5.5.3) or thermoset plastic materials designed to cover the
radiating surface from which they are isolated by ﬂexible spacers. The high internal
damping of laminated steel can also be used to produce other noise inhibiting
components such as cylinder head covers. Noise from crankshaft pulleys can be
reduced by using spoked pulleys or ﬁtting a torsional vibration damped pulley. All
of these palliatives measures have cost implications.

5.6.2 Transmission Gear Noise

The level of gear noise rises with speed at a rate of 6–8 dB with a doubling
of speed, while measurements have shown that gear noise increases at a rate of
2.5–4 dB for a doubling of the power transmitted.

In an ideal pair of gears running at constant speed, power will be transmitted
smoothly without vibration and noise. In practice, however, tooth errors occur (both
in proﬁle and spacing) and in some cases shaft eccentricities exist. If a single tooth
is damaged or incorrectly cut, a fundamental component of vibration is generated at

5.6 Automotive Noise—Sources and Control

shaft speed fss. If the shaft is misaligned or a gear or bearing is not concentric,
vibration (and noise) is generated at tooth meshing frequency ftm with sidebands fs1
and fs2 given by:

For a wheel having N teeth rotating at n rev/min, the tooth meshing frequency

ftm is given (in Hz) by:

271

ð5:23Þ

ð5:24Þ

fs1; fs2 ¼ ftm (cid:6) fss

ftm ¼ nN
60

Furthermore gear teeth are elastic and bend slightly under load. This results in
the unloaded teeth on the driving gear being slightly ahead of their theoretical
rigid-body positions and the unloaded teeth on the driven gear being slightly
behind their theoretical positions. Thus when contact is made between the teeth on
driving and driven wheels there is an abrupt transfer of load momentarily accel-
erating the driven gear and decelerating the driving gear. This leads to torsional
vibration in the transmission and consequent noise generation at tooth meshing
frequency. Considerable effort has been devoted to correcting standard tooth pro-
ﬁles to account for tooth elasticity effects but, because they are subjected to variable
loading, it is impossible to correct for all loading conditions.

5.6.3

Intake and Exhaust Noise

Intake noise is generated by the periodic interruption of airﬂow through the inlet
valves in an ICE, thus creating pressure pulsations in the inlet manifold. This noise
is transmitted via the air cleaner and radiates from the intake duct. This form of
noise is sensitive to increases in engine load and can result in noise level increases
of 10–15 dB from no-load to full-load operation. When a turbocharger is ﬁtted,
noise from its compressor is also radiated from the intake duct. Turbocharger noise
is characterised by a pure tone at blade passing frequency together with higher
harmonics. Typical frequencies are from 2 to 4 kHz.

Exhaust noise is produced by the periodic and sudden release of gases as exhaust
valves open and close. Its magnitude and characteristics vary considerably with
engine types, valve conﬁgurations and valve timing. The fundamental frequency
components are related to the engine ﬁring frequency, which for a four-stroke
engine is given (in Hz) by:

f ¼ engine speed ðrpmÞ
60

(cid:7) number of cylinders
2

ð5:25Þ

Levels of exhaust noise vary signiﬁcantly with engine loading. From no-load to
full-load operation, these variations are typically 15 dB. Turbo-charging not only

272

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

reduces engine-radiated noise by smoothing combustion, but also reduces exhaust
noise. However the turbo-charger itself might be a source of noise.

Attenuation of noise at engine intakes and exhausts calls for devices that min-
imise the pressure ﬂuctuations in the gases while allowing them to ﬂow relatively
unimpeded. Such devices are effectively acoustic ﬁlters. The operational principles
of intake and exhaust silencers (‘mufﬂers’ as they are called in the USA) can be
divided into two types, dissipative and reactive. In practice, silencers are often a
combination of both types.

Intake noise attenuation is generally incorporated into the air ﬁlter and is
achieved by designing the ﬁlter to act as a reactive silencer based on the Helmholtz
resonator principle. For an intake system (Fig. 5.6) comprising an intake venturi
pipe of mean cross-sectional area A and length L together with a ﬁlter volume V,
the resonance frequency is given by:

r

ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
A
LV

f ¼ c
2p

ð5:26Þ

where c = the velocity of sound in air.

This type of design produces a low frequency resonance (a negative attenuation)
but an increasing attenuation at higher frequencies. This can however be offset by
high frequency resonances within the intake venturi.

Dissipative silencers contain absorptive material that physically absorbs acoustic
energy from the gas ﬂow. In construction, this type of silencer is a single chamber
device through which passes a perforated pipe carrying the gas ﬂow. The chamber
surrounding the pipe is ﬁlled with sound absorbing material (normally long-ﬁbre
mineral wool) which produces attenuation across a very broad band of frequencies
above approximately 500 Hz. The degree of attenuation is generally dependent on
the thickness and grade of the absorbing material, the length of the silencer and its
wall thickness. Figure 5.7 shows the cross-section through a typical dissipative
exhaust silencer with a tuned venturi tube.

Reactive silencers operate on the principle that, when the sound in a pipe or duct
encounters a discontinuity in the cross-section, some of the acoustic energy is
reﬂected back towards the sound source thereby creating destructive interference.
This is an effective means of attenuating low frequency noise over a limited range
of frequencies. The effectiveness of the technique can be extended by having

several expansion chambers within the same casing connected together by pipes of
varying lengths and diameters (Fig. 5.8). Silencers of this type increase the exhaust
back-pressure and result in some power loss from the engine.

Exhaust systems on modern vehicles are required to perform the dual task of
reducing both the exhaust gas pollutants and exhaust noise. Catalytic converters are
ﬁtted immediately downstream from exhaust manifolds to ensure that they quickly
achieve operating temperature and thus become quickly effective in urban driving.
In addition to acting as exhaust gas scrubbers, catalytic converters also have an
acoustic attenuation effect resulting from the gas ﬂow through narrow ceramic
pipes. This produces attenuation by both acoustic interference and dissipation
effects.

Silencers are positioned in the exhaust system downstream from the catalytic
converter. Together with their pipework, they form an acoustically resonant system
that needs to be carefully tuned. Furthermore, there is a need to prevent the
transmission of airborne noise from the shell of the exhaust to the body structure of
the vehicle. For this reason it is common for silencers to have a double skin and
insulating layer. This also provides thermal insulation.

Exhaust systems also need to be structurally isolated from vehicle bodywork to
prevent the transmission of structure-borne sound and for this reason are suspended
from the underbody of the vehicle by ﬂexible suspension elements. There is also a
risk that the noise emitted from the tailpipe can cause body resonances if the
exhaust is not properly tuned.

The following are some of the devices used to overcome speciﬁc silencer tuning

problems:

274

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

(cid:129) The Helmholtz resonator—a ﬂow-through resonator that ampliﬁes sound at its

resonant frequency, but attenuates it outside this range.

(cid:129) Circumferential pipe perforations—these create many small sound sources
resulting in a broadband ﬁltering effect due to increased local turbulence.
(cid:129) Venturi nozzles—designed to have ﬂow velocities below the speed of sound,

they are used to attenuate low frequency sound.

5.6.4 Aerodynamic Noise

Aerodynamic noise is due principally to pressure ﬂuctuations associated with tur-
bulence and vorticity of the air surrounding the vehicle. For road vehicles this can
be broken down into a number of noise generating components as follows:
(cid:129) Turbulence in the boundary layer—this is distributed over the vehicle body
(cid:129) Edge effects—due to sudden changes in body shape
(cid:129) Vortex shedding—occurs at various locations on the vehicle body
(cid:129) Cooling fans.

5.6.4.1 Boundary Layer Noise

This tends to be random in character and is spread over a broad band of frequencies.
Even though a whole vehicle is covered by a boundary layer, the noise that it
produces is not normally troublesome. The higher order frequency components in
the spectrum can easily by attenuated with absorbent materials inside body panels.

5.6.4.2 Edge Noise

This is produced by ﬂow separating from sharp corners and edges on the body
structure. As the ﬂow separates from an edge, it rolls up into large vortices which
also break up into smaller ones. It is the intermittent formation and collapse of these
vortices that leads to the narrow band characteristics associated with edge separa-
tion. Noise levels associated with edge noise are generally higher than those for
boundary layer noise and have a more deﬁned band of frequencies. This band of
frequencies is a function of vehicle speed to the extent that changes in the noise
signature can be detected as vehicle speed changes.

It is possible to reduce edge noise by minimising protrusions from the body
surface, making the body surface smooth and ensuring that gaps around apertures,
such as doors, are well sealed. There is also a strong tendency for vortices to be
produced at the A-pillars supporting the front windscreen. The vortices produced
here extend rearwards along the sides of the vehicle enveloping the front sidelights.

5.6 Automotive Noise—Sources and Control

275

These tend to have a low resistance to sound transmission and there is generally
very little which can be done to improve this problem. Changing the proﬁle of the
A-pillars to a well-rounded contour will improving the aerodynamics, but may be
unacceptable from a vision point of view. Edge noise also arises at protuberances
such as door mirrors and at wheel trims. In these cases there is generally scope for
improvements to the proﬁles without impairing their function.

5.6.4.3 Vortex Shedding

This occurs when airﬂow strikes a bluff-body producing a periodic stream of
vortices downstream. This results in the production of pure tones (subjectively the
most annoying of all sounds) at the vortex shedding frequency. The frequency f of
the vortices are related to the relative air speed U and depth d of the bluff body by
the equation:

f ¼ SU
d

ð5:27Þ

where S is the Strouhal number.

Typically S = 0.2 for a long thin rod. This means that for a vehicle ﬁtted with a
roof-rack having 10 mm diameter bars (ﬁtted across the air ﬂow) and travelling at
113 km/h (70 mph), the vortices are shed at a frequency of 640 Hz. This is in the
frequency range where the human ear is most sensitive. A much quieter form of
roof carrier is the enclosed pod-shaped design which tends to avoid the production
of vortices.

5.6.4.4 Engine Cooling Fan

In this case the fan blades shed helical trailing vortices which result in periodic
pressure ﬂuctuations when they strike downstream obstacles. To overcome this
problem, fan rotors are made with unevenly spaced blades and with odd numbers of
blades. This spreads the noise over a band of frequencies—subjectively this is better
than a pure tone. The thermostatically-controlled electrically-driven fans used in
modern vehicles ensure that fan noise does not increase with engine speed, unlike
the former belt-driven designs.

5.6.4.5 Noise from Internal Airﬂows

Internal airﬂow into and out of the passenger compartment is designed for venti-
lation and occupant comfort. The resulting noise is becoming more of a problem as
overall cabin noise is reduced. It is essential for modern vehicles that inlet and
they do not
outlet apertures are carefully sited and designed to ensure that

276

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

themselves generate noise and also that noise from outside the compartment is not
carried into the cabin space by ventilating air.

5.6.5 Tyre Noise

As engine noise is progressively reduced and with the introduction of electric
vehicles, tyre noise is emerging as a serious problem. Tests have shown that tyre
noise can be broken down into two components, tread patterns and road surfaces
being the main culprits. While the problem of road surface excited noise is the
province of highway engineers that of tread pattern excitation noise clearly belongs
to the automotive engineer.

Tyre designers are concerned with reducing tyre noise at source while chassis
engineers are concerned with reducing the transmission of noise from the tyre
contact patch to the vehicle interior. The mechanism of tyre tread noise generation
is due to an energy release when a small block of tread is released from the trailing
edge of the tyre footprint and returns to its undeformed position. There is also a
contribution from the opposite effect at the leading edge of the footprint.

With a uniform tyre block pattern, tonal noise (at a single frequency, with
harmonics, when the wheel rotates at a constant speed) is generated. To overcome
this problem tyre designers have produced block pitch sequences that are designed
to reduce this effect by distributing the acoustic energy over a wide band of fre-
quencies. When tread patterns are taken into account, there is a need to analyse the
effect of the individual impulses produced across the width of the tyre. Computer
software has been developed to aid this aspect of tread evaluation at the design
stage. Models of tyres that take account of their structural dynamic characteristics
and the air contained within them are also used at the design stage. Road surface
design plays a signiﬁcant role in road noise generation, concrete roads tending to be
noisier than asphalt roads because of their different surface characteristics.

5.6.6 Brake Noise

Despite sustained theoretical and experimental efforts over many years,
the
mechanism of noise generation in disc and drum brakes is still not fully understood.
The problem of brake noise is one of the most common reasons for warranty claims
on new vehicles with evidence from one manufacturer suggesting that over 25% of
owners of one year old medium sized cars complain of brake noise problems.

The intractable nature of the problem arises from the complex assemblage of
components in which shoes or pads are held in contact with either a drum or disc
under hydraulic and friction loading. A dynamically unstable brake system results
in vibration of the brake components and this is transmitted to those components
having signiﬁcant surface area such as brake drums and discs. These are particularly
effective radiators of airborne noise.

5.6 Automotive Noise—Sources and Control

277

Progress towards a better understanding of the noise generating mechanisms has
been aided by sophisticated experimental investigations and various mathematical
models have been put forward to aid the design of quieter brakes. See Sect. 5.11 for
a more detailed description of brake NVH problems and solutions.

5.7 Automotive Noise Assessment

As a result of the ever-increasing number of vehicles on our roads, the level of road
trafﬁc noise has continued to grow relentlessly. This is in spite of regulations
imposed by governments and the signiﬁcant reductions in noise levels that have
already been achieved by new vehicles, especially electric vehicles. The quest for
quieter vehicles coupled with good design of new roads is set to continue in an
attempt to drive down overall noise levels.

Vehicle manufacturers have been faced with increasingly stringent noise regu-
lations, e.g. in the period from 1976 to 1996 the EEC drive-by noise requirements
for new cars (with less than 9 seats) has been reduced from 82 to 74 dBA and for
buses/trucks from 91 to 80 dBA. Given that only 3 dBA implies a 50% reduction in
acoustic power emissions, these are very signiﬁcant reductions. The limits for
drive-by noise of new vehicles is part of the process of vehicle homologation and is
currently determined in the EEC by directive 92/97/EEC. The test procedure is
contained in ISO 362-1 (2007) and is outlined in the next section.

5.7.1 Drive-by Noise Tests (ISO 362)

The procedure is to accelerate the vehicle in a prescribed way and in a prescribed
gear past a precision sound level meter set up at a height of 1.2 m above a hard
reﬂecting surface and 7.5 m from the path of the vehicle.

The test site should be a ﬂat open area of minimum radius 50 m containing a
road of at least 3 m width constructed in accordance with ISO 10844 which deﬁnes
the texture and porosity of the road surface. In the noise measurement area, the road
widens to 20 m by 20 m as shown in Fig. 5.9.

In a typical test, the vehicle is driven along the centre of the road at a ﬁxed speed
and in a certain gear until the measurement area is reached. As the front of the
vehicle enters the area, the driver fully depresses the accelerator and maintains it in
this position until the rear of the vehicle leaves the area. For passenger cars with
manual 5-speed transmissions, the approach speed should be 50 km/h with mea-
surements taken for 2nd and 3rd gear operation. The microphone of the sound level
meter should be positioned at A and B (Fig. 5.9).

The maximum A-weighted noise level (sound level meter on the fast setting) is
recorded as the vehicle passes through the measurement area. At least 4 valid
measurements are made in positions A and B for each of the two gear settings. Each

of the four sets of readings are logarithmically averaged and for a given gear setting
the higher of the two averages represents the intermediate value. The overall result
of the test is the logarithmic average of the intermediate values for each gear setting.
In addition to the results of these measurements, vehicle details such as loading,
rating, capacity and engine speeds should be reported. Note that the most recent
versions of the standard take account of more realistic acceleration conditions in
urban environments and include constant velocity as well as constant acceleration
drive-by tests.

5.7.2 Noise from Stationary Vehicles

Since exhaust noise is one of the major sources of vehicle noise and vehicles spend
a signiﬁcant amount of time stationary in trafﬁc queues, noise measurements are
often taken from stationary vehicles in the vicinity of the exhaust silencer. The EEC
directive 92/97/EEC requires measurements to be carried out with the engine
running at 75% of the speed at which it develops maximum power. Maximum
A-weighted sound pressure level is recorded with the microphone of the sound level
meter located 0.5 m from the exhaust tailpipe of the stationary vehicle, 0.2 m above
the ground and at 45° angle of incidence to the tailpipe axis. The results from three
such tests should be reported as part of the vehicle certiﬁcation process.

5.7.3

Interior Noise in Vehicles

The interior noise within a vehicle is produced by the sources discussed above. In
most cases they are periodic, i.e. they have a fundamental component with higher

5.7 Automotive Noise Assessment

279

harmonics. These higher harmonics are called “orders”. In the frequency domain
they can be considered to be sets of excitation components spread over a range of
frequencies. Furthermore these orders are speed dependent—they vary with engine
speed (for an ICE vehicle) and vehicle speed. Their strength depends on power
output.

These excitation components produce periodic vibration responses of the vehicle
structure (chassis, sub-frames and body shell) causing resonance when orders coin-
cide with natural frequencies of the structure. Amplitude and phase variation at points
on the body shell can be attributed to path dynamics and source characteristics. This
interaction between a noise source and the vehicle structure leads to structure-borne
noise in the vehicle interior. In this case the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle
structure modiﬁes the noise spectrum that is transmitted into the vehicle.

Interior noise within a vehicle can also be produced by airborne noise leaking

into a cabin space through apertures in the ﬁrewall and poor door seals.

At a given location in the cabin space, e.g. at the driver’s ear, the sound ﬁeld
may comprise both reverberant and direct sound ﬁeld components. Changes in
operating conditions modify the noise signature and sound ﬁelds.

A procedure for measuring vehicle interior noise is speciﬁed in BS 6086 (ISO
5128). The results of such measurements can be used in the assessment of interior
noise by playing back recordings of the noise to an experienced panel of judges in a
laboratory. Alternatively, the subjective rating of cabin noise can be conducted by
having an experienced team of assessors riding in vehicles on a test route. This
allows various noise and vibration attributes to be determined.

The above techniques require prototype vehicles for testing. In order to reduce
the development time of vehicles, methods have been developed for predicting
noise levels in vehicle interiors at the design stage. Noise path analysis can be used
to investigate the effect of body structure and vibration isolators on structure-borne
noise into a cabin space. One such approached is the so-called Transfer Path
Analysis (TPA) which is outlined here in the context of noise emitted from an IC
engine.

Figure 5.10 illustrates the connection of an engine to a chassis by 3 mounts.
Engine excitation forces/moments produce dynamic forces in the mounts and
chassis (see Sect. 5.10). These in turn are transmitted to the vehicle structure
producing vibration and hence noise within the passenger compartment. Each
mount has its own local x, y and z-axes, with different characteristics along each
axis. Hence there are 9 different transmission paths between the mount system and
the receiver in the passenger compartment.

In TPA, the path characteristics are determined in terms of mechanical-acoustic
frequency response functions Hix(f), Hiy(f) and Hiz(f) where x, y and z are
excitation directions at the ith mount (f = frequency).

TPA can be conducted experimentally in two different ways. One way to
determine the Hi(f)’s is to use a shaker to excite the chassis at each mount position in
turn in the x, y and z-directions over a range of discrete frequencies and measure the
sound pressure in the passenger compartment using a microphone. The second
method is a reciprocal one in which a loudspeaker replaces the microphone and the

effect of loudspeaker output produces vibration at the engine mounts. This is mea-
sured by a set of accelerometers mounted on the body side of the engine mounts.

In order to determine the noise level produced via all transmission paths, there is
a need to know the complex stiffness of each mount in the x, y and z-directions.
This can be determined by separate bench tests. The total sound pressure P pro-
duced via all 9 paths is then given by:

P ¼

where Kix, Kiy, Kiz are the stiffnesses of the ith mount and Xi, Yi, Zi are the dynamic
amplitudes of the vibration at the ith mount in the x, y and z-directions.

Changes in mount stiffness and/or chassis structures can be investigated using

TPA to control the noise level at various locations in the cabin space.

5.8 The Sources and Nature of Automotive Vibration

Vibration arises from a disturbance applied to a ﬂexible structure or component.
Common sources of vibration in all vehicles are ground inputs to suspensions, gear
manufacturing errors and tooth loading effects in transmissions, and generation of
ﬂuctuating dynamic forces in constant velocity joints. ICE vehicles have additional
sources of vibration due to engine rotating and reciprocating unbalance, ﬂuctuating
combustion loads on the crankshaft, and inertia and elasto-dynamic effects in the
engine valve train.

Vibration sources are characterised by their time and frequency domain char-
acteristics. In automotive engineering, most vibration sources produce continuous
periodic disturbances. The only exception of note is that of ground inputs to wheels

5.8 The Sources and Nature of Automotive Vibration

281

in which the excitation is random. This is the dominant source of vibration in a
vehicle (responsible for primary ride) and its effect on chassis vibration has been
described in Chap. 3.

The simplest form of periodic disturbance is harmonic and might typically be
produced by rotor unbalance. In the time domain, this disturbance is represented by
a sinusoid and in the frequency domain by a single line spectrum. It might be noted
that a full representation in the frequency domain requires both amplitude and phase
information. This is important when the disturbance includes several frequency
components, each of which may be phased differently to one another. Typical are
the general periodic disturbances produced by reciprocating engine unbalance and
crankshaft torque. These are responsible for secondary ride.

All mass-elastic systems have natural frequencies, i.e. frequencies at which the
system naturally wants to vibrate. For a given (linear) system these frequencies are
determined only by the mass and stiffness distribution. Corresponding to each
natural frequency there is an associated mode of vibration. See Appendix A for an
outline of basic vibration theory.

Lightly damped structures can produce high levels of vibration from low-level
sources if the frequency components in the disturbance are close to one of the
system’s natural frequencies. This means that well designed and manufactured
sub-systems, that produce low level disturbing forces, can still create problems
when assembled on a vehicle. In order to avoid these problems at the design stage,
it is necessary to model the system accurately and analyse its response to antici-
pated disturbances.

5.9 The Principles of Vibration Control

5.9.1 Control at Source

While it is recognised that the ideal form of vibration control is “control at source”,
there is a limit to which this can be carried out. For example the most dominant
on-board source of vibration in ICE vehicles is the engine. Here, engine combustion
loading and reciprocating inertia combine to produce a complex source of vibration
that varies with engine operating conditions as discussed in Sect. 5.10. Even though
careful arrangement of crank angles can lead to cancellation of some force and
moment components, they can never be completely removed.

Another important source of on-board vibration in all vehicles is due to the
imbalance of rotating parts. While these may meet balancing standards, it should be
appreciated that there is no such thing as “perfect balance”. Hence, small amounts
of allowable residual unbalance remain leading to unwanted but acceptable levels
of vibration.

It follows that even with the best attempts to eliminate vibration at source, there
will always be some unwanted sources of vibration present in all vehicles. It is then

282

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

necessary to minimise the effects of these on driver and passengers. In this section
we review some of the ways in which this can be achieved.

5.9.2 Vibration Isolation

This is a way of localising vibration to the vicinity of the source, thereby preventing
its transmission to other parts of a (vehicle body) structure where it may result in the
generation of noise or other forms of discomfort to the driver and passengers.
Isolation can be achieved by the use of either passive or controllable vibration
isolators. Passive isolators range from simple rubber components in shear, or
to quite sophisticated
combinations of shear and compression components,
hydro-elastic elements.

The basic principles for selecting the appropriate isolator can be illustrated with
reference to the SDOF model shown in Fig. 5.11. This represents a machine of
mass m, subjected to a harmonic excitation arising from rotating unbalance mer,
supported on elastomeric mounts having a complex stiffness k* described by
k(cid:8) ¼ k 1 þ g i
ð

Þ, where k is the dynamic stiffness and η the loss factor.
The effectiveness of the isolation (a function of frequency x) can be deﬁned by

the transmissibility:

TðxÞ ¼ P
F0

ð5:29Þ

where P = the amplitude of the force transmitted to the foundation and F0 is the
amplitude of the excitation force due to unbalance.

Applying Newton’s second law to the FBD in Fig. 5.11b gives:

The force transmitted to the foundation is:

Þ xðtÞ

Employing the standard approach for harmonic excitation outlined in the

Appendix, it can be shown that:

To appreciate how T(x) varies with frequency, it is helpful to show Eq. (5.32) in

dimensionless form by dividing numerator and denominator by k to give:

For low damping elastomers η is of the order of 0.05. The variation of trans-

missibility with frequency ratio r ¼ x
xn

for η = 0.05 is shown in Fig. 5.12.

For an isolator to be effective, the transmissibility must be less than unity, i.e.
P must be less than F0. From Fig. 5.12, it is clear that for frequency ratios from 0 to
approximately 1.4, P is greater than F0 and therefore the isolator magniﬁes the
force to the foundation in this range. Importantly around resonance (r = 1), the
isolator magniﬁes the force to the foundation approximately 20 times for η = 0.05
emphasising the danger during the run up to operating speed (at which r > 1). As
the value of r increases beyond 1.4, the isolator becomes increasingly effective.
However, for very large values of r, it is possible to induce wave-effects in isolators.
These are due to local resonances in the distributed mass and elasticity of the
isolator material and produce additional resonance peaks in the transmissibility
curve (and reduced isolator performance) at certain frequencies of excitation.

An alternative way of describing isolator effectiveness is to calculate the isola-

tion efﬁciency deﬁned as:

Eiso ¼ ½1 (cid:2) TðxÞ(cid:9)

A typical engine isolation system could be expected to have an isolation efﬁ-

ciency of 90% at idle speed.

5.9.3 Tuned Vibration Absorbers

Vibration absorbers are useful for attenuating a resonant response in a system. This
can arise in an automotive context when a harmonic component in the excitation
coincides with a natural frequency of the system.

Vibration absorbers consist of a spring-mass sub-system that is added to the
original system. In effect, energy is transferred from the original system to the absorber
mass which can vibrate with signiﬁcant amplitude depending on the amount of
damping contained in the absorber sub-system. These devices are effective attenua-
tors, but add another degree of freedom to the overall system, producing new natural
frequencies above and below the original natural frequency. Resulting resonant
amplitudes can be controlled with an appropriate choice of damping in the absorber.
This enables absorbers to be used for variable speed applications.

The principles of undamped and damped tuned absorbers can be analysed by
examining the damped absorber and then treating the undamped absorber as a
special case of this. The analysis requires that the original system can be repre-
sented by a single-DOF system (normally based on its fundamental mode). Because
the applications are often of a torsional nature due to rotational out-of-balance, we
will base our analysis on torsion systems. The analysis is of course equally
applicable to translation systems.

Consider the original SDOF system shown in Fig. 5.13a. By adding an absorber,

the two-DOF system shown in Fig. 5.13b is formed.

and hence the natural frequencies of the two sub-systems must

Resonance of the complete 2-DOF system (i.e. when H1 and H2 tend to inﬁnity)
occurs when x coincides with the system’s natural frequencies X1 and X2. This
occurs when D(x) = 0, representing the characteristic equation for the 2-DOF
system.

In designing an undamped absorber it is necessary to consider the magnitude of
the absorber mass in relation the original system mass m1. In general the larger the
inertia ratio l = I2/I1, the more widely separated are the frequencies X1 and X2 and
the wider is the range of frequencies at which the system can operate without
exciting resonance.

The general response of the complete system is best described in terms of
dimensionless amplitudes and frequencies ratios. Denoting the dimensionless
H1 and A2 ¼ K1
amplitudes of I1 and I2 as A1 ¼ K1
H2 together with the frequency

ratio as r ¼ x

These equations enable the amplitude responses to be plotted for various values
of l. Figures 5.14 and 5.15 show plots for of the response of the original mass and
the absorber mass respectively for l = 0.2.

5.9.3.2 The Damped Tuned Absorber (C > 0)

The undamped absorber transfers energy from the original system to the absorber
sub-system resulting in large amplitudes of vibration of the absorber mass. This can
lead to the possibility of fatigue failure in the absorber spring. To overcome this
problem it is necessary in practice to add some damping to the absorber. This also
allows a wider operating range and limits the resonant amplitudes in the region of
the two new system natural frequencies.

In this case, the system is represented by the model shown in Fig. 5.13b. The
amplitude responses are given by Eqs. (5.43) and (5.44). The damping ratio is
given by f ¼ C
p . The two new resonant peaks created by the addition of the

absorber are reduced with the addition of damping but it is not possible to reduce
the amplitude of the main inertia I1 to zero at the original natural frequency of the
system (unlike for the undamped absorber as shown in Fig. 5.14). Thus some of the
effectiveness of the absorber is lost at this resonant frequency when damping is
introduced. However, by careful optimisation of the absorber’s parameters, it is
possible to minimise the response of the main inertia across a frequency range. For
example, for an inertia ratio l = 0.2, f = 0.32 can be shown to be the optimum
damping ratio. This is the underlying principle of the crankshaft absorber as a
device designed to attenuate undesirable vibration effects across a certain range of
speeds.

5.9.4 Vibration Dampers

While vibration absorbers are tuned to a particular system resonance, a damper is a
device designed to generally increase damping in a system, thereby reducing res-
onant amplitudes across a wider range of frequencies. These devices consist of an
inertia (seismic) mass that is coupled to the original system via some form of
damping medium, usually silicone ﬂuid.

Dampers are commonly used to limit torsional oscillations in engine crankshafts
since these have a number of natural frequencies and are subjected to a wide range
of excitation frequencies. The construction of crankshaft dampers and their
implementation is discussed below.

The principles of vibration control can be studied by modelling the crankshaft as
a single disc inertia mounted at the end of a torsional spring ﬁxed at the other end.
This model is based on the ﬁrst mode of torsional vibration of the crankshaft. The
resulting model is shown in Fig. 5.16a. T0 sinxt is the component of crankshaft
toque applied to the equivalent inertia. Adding a damper of inertia I2 and damping
coefﬁcient C results in the 2-DOF system shown in Fig. 5.16b. It is assumed here
that the masses of the ﬂuid and damper casing are negligible. h1 and h2 are the
angular positions of the two masses.
The equations of motion are:

€h1 þ C _h1 þ K1

_h1 (cid:2) C _h2 ¼ T0 sin xt

I1

€h2 (cid:2) C _h1 þ C _h2 ¼ 0

Comparing with Eqs. (5.42) and (5.43), it follows that the amplitude of vibration

A1 is thus a function of r, l and f. For a given value of f the response will

of damping are f = 0 and ∞. When f = 0 the system response is that of the original
SDOF system having a natural frequency xn. and when f = ∞, both masses move

also pass through P. These features are illustrated in Fig. 5.17.

5.10 Engine-Induced Vibration

5.10.1 Single Cylinder Engines

The engine is the most dominant onboard source of vibration for an ICE vehicle
(still by far the majority of vehicles on our roads) and this section of the chapter is
devoted to analysing this source of vibration. Since a multi-cylinder inline engine
can be considered to be a set of single cylinder engines connected to the same
crankshaft, we begin by analysing the dynamics of a single cylinder engine.

5.10.1.1 Kinematic Analysis of a Single Cylinder Engine

Consider the engine mechanism shown in Fig. 5.18, where the crankshaft
is
assumed to rotate at a constant speed x. The component parts are number 1 to 4,
where 1 is assigned to the engine frame. From this geometry:

xB ¼ r cos xt þ l cos /

ð5:48Þ

From the sine rule:

r with n, sin / ¼ sin xt

A second differentiation produces an expression for piston acceleration €xB:

291

Equation (5.52) can be written more generally as:

ð

Þ

ð5:53Þ

where A = 1, B = 1/n and C, D etc. are functions of n.

Thus €xB is described by a component at fundamental frequency x plus a series of
even harmonics (orders), whose amplitudes (which are functions of n) decrease
with increasing order. xB and _xB also contain fundamental components at frequency
x plus higher orders.

5.10.1.2 Total Force and Moment on a Single Cylinder Engine Frame

These comprise a shaking force attributed solely to the inertia effects and a rocking
moment equal and opposite to the crankshaft torque. An understanding of these is
important in engine mounting, the objective being to minimise the transmission of
forces to the vehicle chassis.

The shaking force Fin acting on the engine frame along the line of stroke of the

engine is solely due to inertia effects. This is given from Eq. (5.53) by:

Fin ¼ mB€xB ¼ (cid:2)mBrx2 cos xt þ cos 2xt

þ (cid:10) (cid:10) (cid:10)

(cid:3)

(cid:4)

n

ð5:54Þ

where mB is the equivalent mass acting at the piston end of the connecting rod.

Thus the shaking force comprises a fundamental component at engine speed,

together with a set of even harmonics (orders)—see Eq. (5.53).

The rocking moment acts about an axis parallel to the crankshaft in an opposite

direction to the crankshaft torque Tc shown in Fig. 5.19.

The combined force and moment produce a translational and rotation excitation
of the engine block, Fig. 5.19. The transmission of the force and moment to the
chassis is controlled by a set of engine mounts supporting the engine.

5.10.2 Multi-cylinder Engines

Since the combustion torque from each cylinder is basically a pulse occurring
during the expansion stroke, it is essential that for a multi-cylinder engine, the
torque contribution from each cylinder produces a regular train of pulses. This in
turn dictates that the crank throws, in the order of ﬁring, must have a regular angular
spacing. For two-stroke and four-stroke engines, this spacing is 360/n and 720/n
degrees respectively, where n is the number of cylinders. It follows that a
4-cylinder, 4-stroke engine must have crank throws of 180° in the order of ﬁring.
Possible ﬁring orders are 1-3-4-2 and 1-2-4-3. The crank throws for these two ﬁring
orders (viewed along the crankshaft) are shown in Fig. 5.20.

The spacing of the cylinders along the crankshaft means that the combined effect
of the shaking force along each cylinder results in a shaking moment about an axis
perpendicular to the plane containing the cylinders, i.e. about the z-axis. The
resultant crankshaft torque due to the 180° crank throws will contain ½ order
components (4-stroke engines). Hence there is an equal and opposite rocking
moment exerted on the engine block.

The overall effects of inertia forces and combustion loading are thus:

(cid:129) A shaking force due to inertia forces along the x-axis
(cid:129) A shaking moment about the z-axis due to inertia forces acting at the offset of

each cylinder from the centre plane

(cid:129) A rocking moment about the y-axis due to the reaction to the crankshaft torque.

These effects are shown in Fig. 5.21.

With certain crank conﬁguration, it can be shown that some components of these
forces and moments are eliminated. For example, it can be shown that with a ﬁring
order 1-2-4-3 for a four stroke engine, the 1st and 3rd order inertia force compo-
nents are balanced. Thus, there are only 2nd, 4th and 6th order shaking force
components and only a 2nd order shaking moment component (the 1st, 4th and 6th
shaking moments being balanced).

5.10.3 The Isolation of Engine-Induced Vibration

Engine mounting is an example of vibration isolation. The objective here is prevent
the excitation forces on the engine block from being transmitted to the chassis. This
requires that the engine block be mounted on a set of vibration isolators. The simpler
forms of isolator are a cost-effective solution for sources with a limited range of
operating conditions (amplitudes and frequencies). For situations where the source
of vibration produces a range of operating conditions (as in ICE vehicles), it is often
necessary to consider the use of hydro-elastic or controllable isolators. Some of these
devices are discussed below. In all cases it is essential to understand the basic
principles of vibration isolation (Sect. 5.9.2) to achieve the best results.

The vibration isolation theory discussed in Sect. 5.9.2 suggests that the natural
frequency of the engine on its mounts should be much less than the excitation
forces arising in the engine. This suggests a low stiffness for the engine mounts.
However, there are other considerations. If the engine is supported on very soft
springs there will be signiﬁcant movement of the engine when the vehicle traverses
over rough terrain. Furthermore the excitation forces on the engine will vary with
engine speed.

The requirements for satisfactory mounting of engines are therefore:

(cid:129) A low spring rate and high damping during idling
(cid:129) A high spring rate and low damping for high speeds, manoeuvring and when

traversing rough terrain.

294

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

The following types of mount attempt to meet these conﬂicting requirements:

(a) Simple rubber engine mounts

These are the least costly and least effective forms of mount but clearly do not
meet all the conﬂicting requirements listed above. They do not provide the high
levels of damping required at idling speeds.

(b) Hydro-elastic mounts
These generally contain two elastic reservoirs ﬁlled with a hydraulic ﬂuid. Some
also contain a gas ﬁlled reservoir. This type of mount which is a form of tuned
vibration absorber exploits the feature of mass-augmented dynamic damping. In
operation there is relative motion across the damper which produces ﬂexure of the
rubber component and transfer of ﬂuid between chambers, thereby inducing a
change in mount transmissibility.

(c) Semi-active mounts

These are a form of controllable mount. Their operation is dependent on modifying
the magnitude of the forces that they transmit. They may be implemented via
low-bandwidth, low-powered actuators that are suited to open-loop control. Some
forms of hydraulic semi-active (adaptive) mount use low powered actuators to
induce changes in mount properties by modifying the hydraulic parameters within
the mount. The actuators may then operate in on-off (adaptive) or continuously
variable (semi-active) mode. Considerable effort has been devoted to this type of
technology in recent years.

(d) Active mounts

This type of mount controls both the magnitude and direction of the actuator force.
Active vibration control is typically implemented by closed-loop control. The
actuators need to operate at high speed and together with the sensors require an
operating bandwidth to match the frequency spectrum of the excitation. Power
consumption is generally high in order to satisfy the response criteria.

5.11 Braking Systems NVH

5.11.1 Introduction

Dynamic oscillations in friction brakes which cause noise, vibration and harshness
may be categorised into 2 mechanisms, ﬁrstly a dynamic instability which results in
a constant
rotor speed and secondly a
mechanical vibration with a frequency related directly to rotor speed. The former
makes use of the generalised term of “brake noise” and the second is often referred

frequency independent of

to as “judder” or “drone”. These will be discussed separately in this section which
will focus mainly on disc brake systems. A typical estimate of the proportion of
warranty claims based on the different categories of brake NVH is shown in
Fig. 5.22.

5.11.2 Brake Noise and Vibration Terminology

5.11.2.1 Groan

Groan is a semi-resonant vibration, typically with a frequency of less than 100 Hz.
The mechanism appears to be of a stick-slip nature due to a decreasing friction/
velocity characteristic. Groan is most prevalent at lower speeds where the friction/
velocity gradient is steepest. It may be experienced when a car is allowed to creep
forward with the foundation brake or parking brake slightly activated, hence the
term “creep groan”.

5.11.2.2 Hum

Hum is a resonant sinusoidal vibration and is characterised by a frequency of
between 100 and 400 Hz. The vibration tends to be about the radial axis of the
brake system and is associated with those installations which have a low calliper
mounting torsional stiffness. Hum generally occurs under off brake conditions and
unlike groan the vibration is independent of speed. It is also observed in drum
brakes where the back-plate is caused to vibrate.

296

5.11.2.3 Moan

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Moan is a higher frequency vibration to hum at around 600–700 Hz and results
from whole body calliper movement and bending about its spine. Again observed
with drum brake noise problems.

5.11.2.4 Low Frequency Squeal

In low frequency squeal, the unstable vibration occurs between 2 and 4 kHz and is
therefore below the fundamental frequency of the pad and disc assembly. Of all
instances of geometrically induced instability, which involve transverse disc
vibration, low frequency squeal is the mechanism which has the lowest frequency.
The disc modes are of a low order diametrical nature and typically have between 2
and 4 full nodal diameters. The nodal spacing, in this case, is far greater than in the
case of a traditional brake pad as per the two-opposed-piston calliper design. Low
frequency squeal induces a ﬂexural mode that causes the resultant wavelength of
the vibrating disc to be long compared to the length of the brake pad. Such an
excitation of the disc allows the contact patch to be considered practically ﬂat. This
means that the section can be represented by rigid beams with two degrees of
freedom, transverse and rotational. This model also allows for direct application of
“binary ﬂutter” analysis (see below).

5.11.2.5 High Frequency Squeal

Although high frequency squeal was originally characterised as “squeak” it is now
generally classiﬁed as high frequency squeal. High frequency squeal is charac-
terised by the involvement of higher order disc modes and this is what sets it apart
from low frequency squeal. The modes have, typically, 5 to 10 nodal diameters and
the frequency range is between 4 and 15 kHz. In high frequency squeal the nodal
spacing is less than the pad length and disc natural frequencies are now greater than
the fundamental pad bending mode. High frequency squeal is often present with the
installation of single piston sliding callipers which have high aspect ratio (length to
width) pads.

5.11.2.6 Squelch

This is a quite complicated noise and has been likened both to the sound of wash
leather on glass and also a washing machine ﬁlling up with water. Squelch is, in
fact, an amplitude modulated version of squeak noise, with the modulation depth
being 100%, indicative of the fact that the frequency sources are related. This
modulation of the vibration causes a beating effect, caused by general asymmetry of
the disc.

5.11 Braking Systems NVH

5.11.2.7 Wire Brush

297

This mechanism is observed immediately prior to development of an unstable
squeak. The vibration frequency is very high, up to 20 kHz, and considered to be
non-resonant, although recent studies have shown it to be periodic, at a squeak
frequency, but with a random amplitude modulation.

5.11.2.8

Judder

This is a low speed non-resonant vibration whose frequency decreases as velocity
decreases. The judder frequency is found to be typically less than 10 Hz and is
propagated by the non-uniformity of the disc rubbing path, caused either by disc
thickness non-uniformity or variable frictional characteristics. Low speed judder is
of a stick-slip nature and causes wheel and brake vibration about the suspension or
chassis.

There is also the phenomenon of high speed judder, which again is non-resonant
and has a typical frequency of about 200 Hz. This occurs when the vibration
frequency coincides with road wheel rotational velocity (or a multiple thereof).
High speed judder is often accompanied by an event called “blue (or hot) spotting”
where the disc rubbing path has thermally deformed. High speed judder is often
referred to as drone.

5.11.2.9 Disc Thickness Variation (DTV)

Most brake judder complaints are caused by DTV where the rotor varies in
thickness about its circumferential rubbing path. DTV can be a permanent geo-
metric condition leading to “cold judder” or a transient condition occurring at
elevated temperatures due to non-uniform thermal distortions (“hot judder”).

5.11.3 Disc Brake Noise—Squeal

Above around 2000 Hz noise frequency, it should not be necessary to include the
suspension within any dynamic considerations. Disc brake callipers tend to fall into
2 categories, opposed piston and sliding “ﬁst”, see Fig. 5.23. Above 3000 Hz, the
calliper tends not to play a part and only the disc, pads and the calliper carrier
bracket (with sliding “ﬁst”) need be considered, see Fig. 5.24. The disc has pre-
dominantly two types of vibration as described below.

298

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Fig. 5.23 Opposed piston (left) and sliding “ﬁst” (right)

Fig. 5.24 Only the disc (left) and calliper carrier bracket and brake pads (right) need to be
considered above 3000 Hz

5.11.3.1 Disc Circumferential Modes of Vibration

This occurs when the disc vibrates axially, and in phase, circumferentially. This
causes the nodes of vibration (points of zero displacement) to be circumferential in
their nature. The action of these nodes causes the disc to take the shape of a cup
then a cone due to the action of each cycle. Although a common mode of vibration,
it is rare to experience brake noise associated with such modes. A “Belleville”
(cone) washer deformed shape would be typical of a circumferential mode order.

5.11 Braking Systems NVH

299

5.11.3.2 Disc Diametrical Modes of Vibration

This occurs when the disc tends to vibrate about one or more diameters at one time,
see Fig. 5.25. The action of the nodes in this case causes the disc to take the shape
of a “wave” washer. The number of diametrical nodes gives the so-called mode
number of the vibration.

Disc brake noise results usually from the disc being excited in one or more of its
diametrical mode orders (Fig. 5.26) and as such the noise may be related back to the
disc diametrical mode natural frequencies. The mode order may be plotted against
frequency which should show a smooth curve as in Fig. 5.27. When disc/pad interface

angular spacing (Fig. 5.28)—the third diametrical mode is equivalent to 60° antinode
angular spacing, the ﬁfth diametrical mode equivalent to 36°, and so on.

The disc may also exhibit an in-plane mode of vibration and some research
ﬁndings indicate that both the in-plane and out-of-plane (diametrical modes) need
to coalesce in order for noise to be generated.

Fig. 5.29 Pad modes of vibration—bending mode (left) and torsional mode (right)

5.11.3.3 Pad Modes of Vibration

The pads may vibrate with two possible modes of vibration—bending or torsional
—as shown in Fig. 5.29. The modes do not appear to follow any general trend, such
as in the disc, and their occurrence will vary as the pad natural frequency changes
due to wear. As such the modes will change and noise may emanate at any time
during the wearing process. It is suspected that there is a link between the disc mode
and the pad mode for noise to be generated. This may be evaluated during the
design stage by considering the interface geometry and contact pressure
distribution.

5.11.3.4 Calliper Carrier Bracket Modes of Vibration

The calliper carrier bracket vibrates in a complex manner which is difﬁcult to
predict because of the friction variables involved, see Fig. 5.30.

It should be noted that the pad anchor ﬁngers and the transfer beam are con-
nected when a combined trailing and leading pad abutment is used (often referred to
as “hammer head”). This connection tend to promote the ﬁngers to be in-phase (but
not exclusively). The beam undergoes a “tortuous” mode of vibration that is dif-
ﬁcult to conﬁrm unless a vibration visual technique is employed. To remove the
beam, and so simplify the system, the anchor ﬁngers need to be stronger as the
trailing ﬁngers (forward & reverse) now have to withstand the total braking force at
the pads. The in-plane vibration of the pad may now become signiﬁcant and may
need to be considered when the µ/velocity proﬁle is considered (see stick-slip
model below).

5.11.4 Brake Noise Theories and Models

The mechanisms that cause brake noise to be generated are still poorly understood,
even after many years of research. It has been stated that the USA automotive
industry spend $2 billion a year on brake NVH research, the global warranty claims
per year nearing $1 billion. It is a quality issue and if the problem becomes large
enough to damage the vehicle manufacturers reputation then the whole of the
supply chain becomes involved in seeking a solution.

The theories are numerous—the principal ones being stick-slip (negative
µ/velocity proﬁle of the friction material), sprag-slip and binary ﬂutter (8 degree of
freedom model) as outlined below. Early experimental techniques used to inves-
tigate the phenomena were based on pin-on-disc and cantilever/disc models.
Experimental techniques used to investigate vibrations of a brake system include
Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI), Double Pulsed Laser Holography
and Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Computational methods include FEA and

For the simple sliding spring-mass system shown in Fig. 5.31, the resistive force of
the mass to sliding is given by mgl where l = static friction coefﬁcient (stiction).
The spring force is given by kx where x is the displacement from static equilibrium
position.

Vehicle Speed (kph)

If mgl > kx then the mass will move with the surface. As the relative velocity
between the mass and moving surface is zero, µ is then the static (stiction) value. As
the spring extends, the spring force increases until eventually the spring force
kx = mgl. At this point the mass ceases to move with the surface. As the relative
velocity between the mass and moving surface increases, the friction falls to a value
according to the interface µ/velocity curve (see Fig. 5.32 for typical example) and
the spring force kx > mgldyn where ldyn is now the dynamic friction coefﬁcient.
This is the “slip” phase.

The mass is then pulled back against the moving surface and in doing so the
relative interface speed increases so the dynamic friction reduces still further. At the
same time the spring extension (x) reduces and so does the spring force kx. A point
is reached where again mgldyn > kx and the mass stops moving against the surface.
The friction level then increases to the static value. This is the “stick” phase.

The stick-slip oscillation may be maintained at low speed but if the speed
increases a point will be reached where mgldyn = kx and a steady non-oscillatory
state is achieved. It is known that most brake noise occurs at low speed (downhill
braking or just before coming to a stop) and will cease if vehicle speed increases
during the braking event.

5.11.4.2 Sprag-Slip Model

The model comprises a rigid strut AB that contacts a moving surface at point “A”
and tilted at an angle “h” to that surface. The strut AB is connected to a relatively
rigid cantilever beam BC which is encased in a rigid body at point “C”, as shown in
Fig. 5.33.

Resolving forces vertically gives:

R ¼ L þ Ftanh

and taking moments about “B” gives:

which reduces to:

Note that F approaches inﬁnity as l tends towards cot h, which is when
spragging will occur. When the inclination angle is set at the “sprag” angle of
tan−1l, or greater, the strut will “dig-in”. The normal force to the rubbing surface
then increases until ﬂexure of the system allows a secondary strut arrangement
“AC” (with angle / to the surface) to be established whereby the contact angle
reduces below the sprag angle. The forces then reduce and the strut continues to
slide. The sprag angle is often referred to as the “locking angle” in general engi-
neering applications (e.g. Morse tapers and the metal inserts in CV belts).

The calliper represents a more complex suppport system with a multiple of “sprag
angles” and it is this sprag-slip mechanism that may be used to address a limited
number of noise issues relating to the coefﬁcient of friction at the disc/pad interface.

5.11.4.3 Binary Flutter

The proposal is that the disc may be considered as a rigid body over the length of
the pad. The disc can therefore exhibit both axial and rotational motion as shown in
Fig. 5.34. This is similar to an aircraft wing which is able to exhibit both bending
and torsion modes of vibration. The principal node for bending (zero displacement)
is at the aircraft fuselage whilst that for torsion is along the length of the wing to the
tip. If the two modes coalesce at the same frequency then the vertical movement of
the wing (ﬂapping) may become dangerously large. This can only occur if the
natural frequencies are close and the phase difference between the modes is 90° i.e.
the wing twist (or the angle of attack) is at a maximum when the wing is level (zero
bending). The angle of attack then promotes wing lift (or dip) to exacerbate the
forced bending of the wing.

Amplitude/phase plot

To prevent such mode coalescence, the frequency difference between modes
needs to be greater and in the case of aircraft wings a mass is often added to the tip
of the wing. This changes the bending frequency but as the mass lays on the
torsional nodal line, the torsional frequency remains unchanged.

Figure 5.35 shows potentially coupled modes for a brake disc. A disc may “hold”
2 normal modes of vibration simultaneously with very close natural frequencies. The
two modes are displaced circumferentially by half a node pitch such that one node is
positioned at the node of the other as indicated by the amplitude/phase plot in the
Figure. Coalescence of these two modes may result in brake squeal.

5.11.5 Brake Noise Solutions or “Fixes”

There is no single philosophy or methodology than can be used to predict brake noise at
the design stage. Modelling techniques are often used to predict noise but if

5.11 Braking Systems NVH

307

unreasonable assumptions are made within the model it generally becomes invalid.
Such methods include the analysis of the Centre of Pressure (CoP) at the disc/pad
interface to assess the potential for “spragging”. Another method is to consider the disc/
pad interface geometry to determine if an integer number of disc antinodes may “ﬁt”
below the pads and whether there is a potential pad mode at that frequency. More
advanced techniques such as Complex Eigenvalue Analysis (CEA) based on sophis-
ticated ﬁnite element models of the brake assembly have come to the fore in recent
years. However such methods tend to overpredict the number of unstable modes of
vibration (that may give rise to squeal) compared to experimental measurements.

Thus brake noise remains unpredictable and, if noise becomes a problem during
the early months of vehicle release, then the solution (referred to as a “ﬁx”) is often
a retroﬁt device or design modiﬁcation to the brake, as outlined below. The problem
then arises that once a noise “ﬁx” is found to work, no individual will have the
courage to remove it and so it becomes a permanent feature of the brake design.

5.11.5.1 Noise “Fix” Shims

Visco-elastic or constrained layer shims are constructed from a thin metallic plate
(typically 0.75 mm), with rubber bonded to one or both sides and adhesive on both
sides. They are in effect a damping medium and are attached by adhesive (hot or
cold) between the pad back-plate and the calliper pistons(s). If the pad begins to
vibrate (or oscillate linearly), the rubber deforms and energy is lost through hys-
teretic damping. The principal concern is delamination of the shim during operation
which is especially likely to occur at elevated temperatures. In addition, if dust
penetrates the bond interface then delamination and corrosion may progress and the
shim becomes ineffective. Typical shims are shown in Fig. 5.36.

In some cases the shim is purely of stainless steel construction to which a thin
layer of grease is applied. The principle is that the grease acts rather like the
elastomeric shim and induces damping into the system. In addition it reduces the
in-plane friction forces between the back-plate and the pistons so increasing the pad

abutment/anchor bracket force and inhibiting pad vibration. Molybdenum disul-
phide is one such high temperature grease.

5.11.5.2 Added Mass

Adding mass to speciﬁc parts of the braking system is a common method of
alleviating noise. The aim is to shift the frequency of one part so avoiding a
“coupling” of frequencies or modes of vibration. Carrier brackets are ﬁrst tested
with bolted masses and then the casting is modiﬁed to include the mass (Fig. 5.37).
Small masses are sometimes ﬁtted to the ends of the pad in order to move the
frequency of the pad away from a disc frequency (Fig. 5.38).

The excitation of the back-plate of a drum brake may result in “hum”. To
alleviate the noise in a typical drum brake, a 100 g mass may be added to the
back-plate antinode (Fig. 5.39 top). In other more severe noise conditions, inertial

Spring inserts.

dampers can be used (Fig. 5.39 bottom). Note that the latter are not only adhered
across the antinode positions but also on the rim of the back-plate.

With both discs and drums, a noise may be eradicated by adding or removing
mass to or from the rotor. This must be done such that the mass is positioned at the
node of one mode which will then be at the antinode of the other (potentially
coupled) mode. This introduces asymmetry to the rotor.

310

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

The general rule is:

2n
z

¼ Integer

where n = squeal mode order, z = number of added masses.

So if the mode order n = 3, the number of added masses z = 2, 3 or 6.
Although this is very effective and does work, it is only applicable to that
particular mode order. Also the addition or removal of mass from the rotor may
result in unacceptable temperature gradients around the rotor and thus lead to the
onset of judder. Some masses are constructed to include elastomeric interfaces so
damping also plays a part in reducing noise propensity.

For ventilated disc brakes, the distribution of mass may be altered to promote a
frequency shift). The ventilated rotor design shown in Fig. 5.40 changed the fre-
quency difference between two potentially-coalescing normal modes from 20 to
769 Hz. This was for a heavy but low speed vehicle so the problems of ensuing
judder were not as prominent. Such modiﬁcations address the condition of binary
ﬂutter and prevent normal modes of vibration from coalescing (possible with both
discs and drums).

5.11.5.3

Introducing Asymmetry

Brake systems are invariably symmetrical, the reason being to avoid parts being
ﬁtted the wrong way round. Such symmetric systems are more likely to experience
instability and the introduction of asymmetry may often result in better noise
alleviation. One technique is to offset the pistons to give a trailing “centre of brake
pressure”. This is often done to prevent pad taper wear but it also tends to stop the
“spragging” action where the pad effectively “digs-in” at its leading edge. Such
“spragging” induces a stick-slip mechanism, resulting in noise. Similarly, it may be
seen that the calliper “ﬁngers” may be offset or differ in size (width). Such small
changes affect the symmetry of the system and tend to reduce noise propensity.

5.11.6 Disc Brake Vibration—Judder and Drone

Brake judder is a mechanically induced vibration with a frequency related to the
rotational speed of the wheel. There are two forms of judder, cold and hot. All
judder will be detected as a brake torque variation but not all will demonstrate a
pressure variation. Judder is felt as a vibration at the steering wheel and brake pedal.
It may also be heard as a drumming sound within the cabin.

Generally the causes of cold judder are well understood and may be listed as brake
wear, corrosion, and surface ﬁlm transfer (or pad deposition), often referred to as
the third body layer. These effects are considered below with reference to the basic
equation for braking torque. For the typical disc brake arrangement shown in
Fig. 5.41, the braking torque (T) is given by:

T ¼ Flr

How each of these parameters may vary to cause judder is now considered.

So the friction coefﬁcient may be determined solely from the relative shear and
compressive strength properties at the interface if the materials remain the same.
Therefore, for l to change, the interface surface materials or characteristics must
change as for example if the surface transfer layer (3rd body layer) is incomplete, see

If “N” remains constant “F” will vary with μ.

Inner radius contact

Outer radius contact:
pistons are pushed back

Fig. 5.44 Disc machined but not parallel

Fig. 5.43. This will produce a variable friction coefﬁcient which will not be seen as a
pressure variation but as a torque variation. To avoid such variable conditions, the
brake must be properly “bedded” or “run-in” to ensure the ﬁlm is properly transferred
from pad to disc early after a service change. It is known that if both disc and pad are
not properly “bedded”, the material (surface) transfer between the two materials can
be deposited in a random fashion leading to a variable surface transfer ﬁlm.

If, after a high speed stop, the pad remains in contact with the disc then the disc
cannot readily cool in this region. This results in a visible impression on the disc
known as “pad imprinting”, the shape being that of the pad. This condition also
results in variable friction levels and judder.
Variable effective disc radius “r”

Such a situation may occur due to a manufacturing error such as a non-parallel
disc as indicated in Fig. 5.44. This will produce a variable contact radius and a
variable torque. It will also be seen as a pressure variation because the pistons will
be pushed back by the thicker regions of the disc.

Even if the piston pressure were to be considered as constant, it is clear that the

effective radius of the disc changes considerably and so will the torque.
Variable Force “F”

Piston Force F ¼ Pressure (cid:7) Piston Area ¼ pA

As the piston areas remain constant it is clear that a variable force may only vary
because of a pressure change. With this consideration it is necessary to understand
why the pressure could change.

Manufacturing errors and tolerance allowances may cause the disc to “wobble”
when rotated, a condition known as “swash” or “runout”. If this effect is signiﬁcant

result in disc thickness variation (DTV)

then the disc may in fact touch the brake pads during disc rotation even if the brakes
are not applied. This can result in “off brake wear” and lead to disc thickness
variations (DTV) as shown in Fig. 5.45. Figure 5.46 shows signs of initial wear on
opposite sides of a disc which will progress to DTV. Both swash and DTV can
cause cyclic variations in piston force leading to judder.

To prevent off brake wear, techniques are employed such as “seal rollback”
when the seal tends to “pull” the piston away from the pads so allowing the pads to
be “pushed back” from the disc, known as “piston knockback”. In some instances
the designer may account for “swash” and indeed tolerance the brake assembly
accordingly. This may lead to a “soft” pedal feel and excessive pedal travel. As
such “seal rollback” is a favoured approach.

5.11.6.2 Hot Judder

Hot judder is the least understood of all mechanisms. In general “hot judder” is
experienced after a heavy braking application followed by light braking, typically
when exiting a motorway. Research has shown that during a heavy braking
application, the kinetic energy absorbed by the brake causes the disc to “warp”; the
disc experiences a thermal deformation equivalent to a waveform often exacerbated
by the presence of vanes in a ventilated disc. As this “wave” passes through the
caliper/pads, it pushes the pistons backwards so inducing a pressure variation
leading to judder. In some instances this “wave” is temporary and will reduce as the
disc cools. This makes it difﬁcult for test engineers to identify the underlying cause.
In more severe braking, the “wave” becomes permanent so judder is then experi-
enced with every brake application. The only solution then is regrinding or
replacement of the disc.

Figure 5.47 shows the face proﬁle of a brake disc before and after testing at
elevated temperatures. It should be noted that the initial disc did demonstrate a
degree of runout (swash) in addition to DTV (similar to Fig. 5.45). In addition the
post-tested disc showed a second order wave in addition to DTV (post-testing
variation curve). Such an out of plane displacement did result in judder. The “wave”
was permanent and did not show further deformation. After regrinding the disc was
retested and the second order “wave” was re-established.

5.11.6.3 Disc Brake Drone

Disc brake drone is the result of a high frequency judder mechanism. It emanates
from raised areas within the disc generated during braking which are seen as “blue”
or “hot” spots after the disc cools as shown typically in Fig. 5.48. This generation

316

5 Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)

Hot (Blue) spots 

Fig. 5.48 Blue (hot) spots seen on a disc after cooling

Extreme Case of “Hot spotting” 

of blue spots is often referred to as “hot spotting”. On cooling the spots become
recesses so subsequent “hot spotting” occurs elsewhere aound the disc (Fig. 5.48).
Cast iron is an iron alloy comprising carbon, silicon and possibly other alloying
elements. If any areas of the disc are slightly prouder than the surrounding areas
(possibly due to pad imprinting) then they become hotter than the surrounding
material. At high temperatures exceeding 650–700 °C, areas of martensite can be
formed on the disc surface. Martensite is an abrasive hard material which will
expand more than the surrounding material because of the elevated temperatures.
As such the problem is exacerbated with temperatures ever increasing. The process
appears to be random in nature (Fig. 5.48) but early signs of “hot spotting” indicate
that there may be an element of symmetry (Fig. 5.49). It was noticed that these “hot
spots” were antisymmetric, on the rear face being between the visible “spots” as
seen in Fig. 5.49, on the front, a wavelike shape being apparent.

Early formation of Hot (Blue) Spotting 

Fig. 5.49 Early signs of hot (blue) spotting

5.11 Braking Systems NVH

317

The spots are often related to the disc vent design and are diametrically opposed.
If these “vent” effects do not merge to form hot spots then they may form a ripple
on the disc surface and cause very high frequency drone. An attempt to resolve this
effect would be to make the number of vents equal to a prime number, so making
merging less likely. Experiments show these spots to “hunt” about the disc proﬁle,
wearing away and then re-establishing themselves somewhere else. The radial
position also changes over time. The high number of spots gives a higher frequency
than “judder” and vibration is not felt at the steering wheel or brake pedal. The most
prominent feature of this form of instability is an annoying “droning” sound that is
heard in the cabin. Hence the term “brake drone” is used to deﬁne this problem.

5.11.6.4

Judder Summary

Regardless of the above general comments, judder is not simply a brake problem
and the suspension system plays a signiﬁcant role in exacerbating the problem. If
the vehicle suspension system is over-sensitive to brake torque variations then
modiﬁcations to the elastomeric bushes can often alleviate the problem. The issues
regarding hot judder are often a result of excessive thermal gradients, uneven
heating and dissipation, which can be addressed by careful design of the disc
venting system. It is also necessary to stress relieve the discs before machining,
otherwise “in-service” stress relieving will occur if elevated temperatures are
experienced.

5.12 Concluding Remarks

This chapter has provided a foundation for understanding the important NVH issues
in vehicles and the processes needed to mitigate these issues leading, to improved
vehicle reﬁnement. It includes reviews of basic acoustic and vibration theory and
considers all the major sources of automotive noise and vibration, with a particular
focus on internal combustion engines (still the predominant source of motive power
in most road vehicles) and on friction brakes (still required even on fully electric
vehicles). The fact that NVH is covered in the ﬁnal chapter of this book is no
coincidence. It is often the ﬁnal part of the vehicle design process to be considered
and often continues once series production has commenced with the need to ﬁnd
“ﬁxes” to urgent NVH problems. Yet vehicle reﬁnement (i.e. lack of NVH issues) is
one of the key selling points of any vehicle and helps to distinguish one vehicle
manufacturer from their rivals, especially at the quality end of the market.
