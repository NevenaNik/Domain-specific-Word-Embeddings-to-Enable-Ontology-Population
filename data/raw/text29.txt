Thorough knowledge of how a vehicle is made and manufactured, of how its com-
ponents should be designed and integrated into a sound system, may not be enough
to conceive of and develop a successful car.

Such knowledge is, of course, essential for obtaining a set of assigned targets for
the product. We do not mean to belittle this knowledge, whose development is the
main objective of these two books on the automotive chassis, but we must keep in
mind that the success of a product is mostly dependent on how these targets are able
to satisfy the customer’s needs.

The combination of vehicle technical objectives and a brief description of its
architecture make up what is everywhere known, with particular reference to the
case of the car, as product concept or conceptual design.

The concept development is the starting point for development of a car. It can be
expressed with a sketch or with a three-dimensional simpliﬁed model, suitable for
explaining the car’s desired appearance and its main functions.

This visual documentation must be accompanied by an exhaustive quantitative
deﬁnition of technical and economical characteristics whose congruence and feasi-
bility must be demonstrated.

These characteristics must be derived from a good understanding of customer

needs and of how much a customer is inclined to spend to ensure satisfaction.

To deﬁne a concept means, therefore:

(cid:129) to describe a product in terms of technical functions and speciﬁcations;
(cid:129) to determine the product conﬁguration and to choose its main components; and
(cid:129) to identify character, personality, feelings, and other traits this new product will

offer to the customer.

Each car manufacturer emphasizes different aspects of the product concept and
determines, therefore, its characteristics and its potential success at the very beginning
of the development process.

2

Part III: Functions and Speciﬁcations

The central issue of the concept deﬁnition process is to obtain involvement
throughout the company; the concept is partly driven by objective and measurable
facts, whose determination will be the job of technicians, but also by insights that
will be contributed not only by marketers, but by anyone who has gathered sufﬁcient
experience to contribute creatively.

People in charge of detailed product design, component speciﬁcation, styling,
manufacturing development, sales and service should be involved, because their
activity will eventually determine the degree of customer satisfaction.

While ignoring the constrictions of the above operations during concept devel-
opment can cause large inconveniences, it is also true that an excessive involvement
can cause conﬂicts and compromises, that can trivialize or obscure product charac-
teristics.

A new vehicle cannot be simply the extrapolation of previous knowledge of cus-
tomer needs, as assessed by the popularity of existing products; very often successful
cars have been born as a response to needs that were unexpressed until the time of
product launch.

We should remember, to underscore what we have said, the commercial success
of the manufacturers who ﬁrst launched sport utility vehicles, coupè-cabriolet, or
minivans.

When deﬁning a new concept, it is important to proceed according to the following

steps:
(cid:129) to focus on customer needs;
(cid:129) to identify latent or hidden needs, in addition to those demonstrated by existing

products; and

(cid:129) to develop a common comprehension of customer needs.

There is an important difference between customer needs and product speciﬁ-
cation. Customer needs are independent of the product under development and are
therefore not bound to the concept. Needs must be identiﬁed and focused on without
necessarily knowing if and how they will be satisﬁed.

Product speciﬁcations depend, on the other hand, on the deﬁned product architec-
ture and the kind of components that have been deﬁned; their linkage with customer
needs can be understood only by knowing the success of similar products already in
the market place.

If an effective communication channel is established between customers and peo-
ple in charge of product development, a sound knowledge of customer needs results.

Customers are identiﬁed through the following methods:

(cid:129) market surveys;
(cid:129) direct interviews; and
(cid:129) product use monitoring.

The purpose of the following chapters is not to develop a complete knowledge of
these marketing techniques; rather, we would like to supply the future vehicle engi-
neers with a view, complementary to the technical one, that enhances their interaction
with marketing experts or customers.

Part III: Functions and Speciﬁcations

We will examine the following topics, with particular reference to those aspects

having a major impact on chassis and on chassis components design.

Transportation statistics

Transportation statistics represent the starting point for knowledge of vehicle use;
these statistics make reference to Italy and to the European Union as far as passenger
trafﬁc and transportation of goods are concerned.

In particular, we will analyze the volume breakdown between different means of

transportation, in order to determine the average expected lifetime of vehicles.

Readers from different countries could take these data into consideration and

adapt this method of analysis to their own interests.

Vehicle functions

In this chapter, we explore vehicle system design, which is the determination of the
vehicle technical characteristics that condition the level of satisfaction of customer
needs.

Since the ﬁeld of our study is limited to the chassis, we will reduce system design

to dynamic performance, in particular, handling and ride comfort.

We will also outline the methods of correlation of objective technical character-

istics with customer needs, which are subjective and only qualitatively expressed.

We will tackle vehicle mission deﬁnition as a description of the expected events
during the vehicle’s useful life; these data are necessary to forecast the age resistance
of a vehicle and to deﬁne its scheduled maintenance.

Regulations

A signiﬁcant inﬂuence on vehicle and, therefore, chassis characteristics is played by
the legislative rules and regulations imposed by governments.

This matter is in continuous evolution and is now standardized in the European
Union by general directives with which the technical regulations of the member
states must comply; again, we will propose the European legislation as a reference,
noting that other states have introduced legislation that is quite similar; existing rules
address passive safety, active safety, pollution, and energy consumption, among the
topics relevant to chassis design.

Many other technical organizations, supported by consumer associations, and
specialist magazines, according to their importance, inﬂuence product design with a
power equal to legislation; an issue that must also be taken into account.

Chapter 17
Transportation Statistics

Data reported in this chapter were mainly extracted from institutional documents of
ANFIA, ACEA, ISTAT and Eurostat.

ANFIA (Associazione Nazionale Fra le Industrie Automobilistiche), the Italian
national association of automotive manufacturers,1 was established in 1912 and is
spokesman for its associates, on all issues (from technical, economic, ﬁscal and
legislative to qualitative and statistical) regarding the mobility of people and goods.
Among several objectives, ANFIA has the task of gathering data and information,

providing ofﬁcial statistical data for this segment of industry.

ANFIA publishes every year a report called Autoincifre (Figures of the Automo-
bile), which is one of the fundamental references for statistical data on motoring in
Italy and Europe. Much of the data collected in this report comes also from PRA
(Pubblico Registro Automobilistico), the public vehicle register managed by ACI,
the Association of Italian Motorists.

ISTAT (Istituto nazionale di STATistica) the Italian government institution for
statistics2 is well known. Established in Italy in 1926, ISTAT is the main producer
of ofﬁcial statistics for citizens and public decision takers. It works in full autonomy
while maintaining continuous interactions with the academic and scientiﬁc world.

This institution is fully involved in gathering European statistics and gathers data
according to the fundamental rules of impartiality, reliability, efﬁciency, privacy and
transparency.

The role of ACEA (Association des Constucteurs Européen d’Automobile3) in the
European Union is similar to that of ANFIA in Italy; the major vehicle manufacturers
with headquarters in Europe are associated with ACEA.
This association represents European manufacturers in the European Union under
a wide spectrum of activities, setting up research groups, supporting manufacturers
with objective data and creating new legislative proposals in the ﬁelds of mobility,
safety and environmental protection.

Eurostat4 is the statistical ofﬁce of the European Union. Its job is to supply the
Union with statistics from corresponding national services. The European Statistic
Service (ESS) adopts similar methods, allowing it to obtain comparable data. This
service was established in 1953.

These data, accessible to the public, concern:

(cid:129) key indicators of Union policies;
(cid:129) general and national statistics;
(cid:129) economy and ﬁnance;
(cid:129) population and social conditions;
(cid:129) industry, commerce and services;
(cid:129) agriculture and ﬁsheries;
(cid:129) commerce with foreign nations;
(cid:129) transportation;
(cid:129) environment and energy;
(cid:129) science and technology.

A further source of information within the European Union derives from the pub-
lic documents of the different General Directions5; among these the Environment
General Direction has set up a working group, including associations from the auto-
motive and oil industries, that published the interesting report Auto-Oil II, on the
impact of oil product combustion.

Since all data become obsolete quickly, we invite readers interested in updated
details to consult the mentioned public sites, which allow access to the original
archives.

In the interests of consistency, we highlight that the oldest data refer to the
European Union as the original 15 countries (EU 15), including Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom and the more recent ones refer to
the present 28 countries (EU 28), including also Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus,
Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and
Slovenia.

17.1 Trafﬁc Volume

Trafﬁc volumes are conventionally measured by the product of transported units
times the distance covered by such transportation; therefore:

5General Directions are, for the European Union, the equivalent term for Department or Ministry.

17.1 Trafﬁc Volume

7

(cid:129) passenger trafﬁc is measured in passengers per kilometer [pass×km];
(cid:129) the transportation of goods is measured in metric tons per kilometer [t×km].

It should be pointed out that the metric ton equivalent to 1,000 kg is a unit of
mass; in any case what is relevant is the quantity of transported material, therefore
mass and not weight. Nevertheless, the habit of considering the kilogram as a unit of
weight and not of mass persists and therefore we sometimes see statements that trafﬁc
volume has the same dimensions as energy, which is only correct if the kilogram is
assumed to be a unit of weight.

It is also true that if we assume a value for the acceleration of gravity and we
know the vehicle coefﬁcient of resistance, which will be explained later on, trafﬁc
volume is proportional to the energy spent to overcome motion resistance relative to
the payload.

What was said could also apply to passenger trafﬁc, if we substitute the number

of passengers with the corresponding mass (conventionally 70 kg per passenger).

These considerations do not take into account the altitude difference between
origin and destination or speed variations along the route, which are, instead, relevant
for determining motion resistance and prime energy consumption.

17.1.1 Passenger Transportation

Figure 17.1 reports passenger trafﬁc volume in the European Union from 1970 to
2001, broken down according to the primary passenger transportation vehicles, such
as cars, buses, urban railways with subways, trains and airplanes.

Cars deﬁnitely predominate over other means of transportation; car trafﬁc repre-
sented in 2001 more than 78% of the total, and trafﬁc on tires (cars and buses) is
about 87%; this breakdown varies little during these years.

The total volume increased about 4% yearly during the ﬁrst twenty years con-
sidered in this diagram; afterwards the growth slowed down to approximately zero
in the last years for which data is available. Air transportation with its continuity of
development is an exception.

A similar table is reported for the following years in Fig. 17.2. The total value is
at present almost steady, around 6,500 Gpass × km as well as the modes breakdown.

17.1.2 Transportation of Goods

Figure 17.3 shows the volume of transportation of goods in the European Union from
1970 to 2001, broken down according to the main travel modes; in this case, road,
rail, inland and sea navigation, and pipeline transportation are considered.

Here again road transportation is predominant: it accounted for 45% of the total
in the last year of this period, starting from a percentage of 35% in 1970. The role
of railroads has been reduced from 20%, at the beginning, to 8% in 2001. The
contribution of sea navigation is relevant, considering the higher average distance
travelled.

In the most recent years, all developed countries have recorded continuous growth
in transportation demand. Factors stimulating this growth have been many (econom-
ical and ﬁscal integration, market globalization, etc.) and seem likely to last in the
medium term.

The most stimulating factor was the European economic integration process,

implying free transfer of goods in the Union.

17.1.3 Energy Consumption

Energy consumption is usually measured in tons of equivalent petroleum [tep], cor-
responding conventionally to 41.87 GJ or 11.63 MWh; these values deﬁne the equiv-
alent quantity of heat that is delivered by burning a ton of oil of average quality.

This unit is also used to measure energy from sources other than oil, evaluated at

the energy cost for their production.

17 Transportation Statistics

For instance, railroad transportation uses a combination of electric energy and oil
reﬁnery products; electric energy itself is produced partly in thermal power stations
using oil products or natural gas and partly in hydroelectric power stations. Other
contributions can come from geothermal energy or nuclear energy.

Every contribution is converted to an oil value, considering production losses and

important ﬁnal applications.

2014; this share can be broken into:
(cid:129) 2.4% for railroad transportation;
(cid:129) 82.4% for road transportation;
(cid:129) 13.6% for air transportation;
(cid:129) 1.6% for inland navigation.

This last ﬁgure includes not only river, lake and channel navigation, but any mar-
itime navigation in the European Union. The ﬁgure therefore includes sea navigation.
The energy used for sea navigation, the so-called bunkered quantity at the sailing
harbour, is partially used for transportation to countries outside the European Union;
it is conventionally treated as an oil export. In 2001 this quantity was estimated as
43.5 Mtep, about 14% of total transportation consumption.

The transportation system relies mainly on oil products; railroad transportation
uses diesel fuel for 30% of its total energy consumption and a notable part of electric
energy comes from oil combustion as well.

Road transportation uses primarily oil reﬁnery products; Italy and Holland are an
exception, consuming respectively 9% and 7% liqueﬁed petroleum gas for traction
(1999); the contribution of coal and natural gas is at this time negligible. Probably
this situation will remain unchanged for the near future. Total consumption shows a
leveling in recent years.

The following Fig. 17.6 shows the share between the different types of fuel used

in transportation. In this case the quantities are measured in million of Tjoule.

The growth of diesel fuel over gasoline is evident; this trend is partly justiﬁed by
the different retail prices of the two fuels and partly by the more efﬁcient combustion
of diesel engines. We should also remember that quantities are measured by mass
units, but customers are paying by volume; at the same volume, diesel fuel contains
12% more energy than gasoline.

We should also notice the appearance of bio-fuels at the end on the period of time

under examination.

We have tried, using the available data, to compare the energy consumption of
different means of transportation; we have deﬁned as energy efﬁciency the amount
of energy necessary to perform a unit of trafﬁc volume. We assume, as a common
indicator, the goods trafﬁc unit [t×km], which allows us to summarize with a single
measurement goods and passengers transportation. We assumed an average mass of
70 kg for each passenger, including the transported baggage.

Accepting this questionable equivalence, we obtain the diagram of Fig. 17.7.

total vehicle weight and by its maximum speed.

The speciﬁc traction force may be interpreted, assuming that the vehicle is using
its maximum power at its maximum speed with its maximum payload, as the ratio
between traction force Ft , which in a steady condition equals the motion resistance,
and vehicle weight; this is like an overall friction coefﬁcient. Another interpretation
could be the energy supplied by the engine to move a unit of mass for a unit of
distance.

Fig. 17.7 Comparison of energy efﬁciency of different transportation means; data are elaborated
from time series of the European Union

Figure 17.8 reports the speciﬁc traction force for different kinds of vehicles at dif-
ferent maximum speeds. Each curve has been obtained by considering many vehicles
of the same family and charting them on the diagram. Curves on this diagram repre-
sent the lower envelope of the points represented.

This methodology may be questioned because only the top speed is taken into
account and this may not reﬂect the most efﬁcient condition for the traction engine;
in addition, the total weight is considered, instead of the payload alone.

All curves are superimposed on an ideal line that on logarithmic scales is straight,
deﬁned as the limit for isolated vehicles. This line can be interpreted as the optimum
use condition for each vehicle, independent of its propulsion system.

The right side of Fig. 17.8 shows an enlargement of the part of this diagram
regarding ground vehicles. It will be noticed that all vehicles including trailers are
more efﬁcient than isolated vehicles and are set below the limit line.

Although these are approximations, this parameter gives an immediate idea of the
energy efﬁciency of different vehicles, and the distance to the limit lines suggests
the amount of room for improvement.

17.2 Operating Fleet

17.2.1 Quantity

Vehicles owned by naturalized or legal residents of Europe totalled about 378 millions
in 2015; they comprise the so-called vehicle operating ﬂeet.

Table 17.1 shows a time series for private vehicles, mainly passenger cars; while
Table 17.2 shows public service vehicles, including commercial vehicles, light,
medium and heavy duty trucks and buses.

The year 2000 ﬁgures on total transport ﬂeet are also available for reference

(source Eurostat):
(cid:129) the railway ﬂeet, included 40,000 engines and rail cars, about 76,000 cars for

passenger transportation and about 500,000 freight cars;

(cid:129) the navigation ﬂeet, included about 15,000 vessels;
(cid:129) the air ﬂeet, included about 4,900 airplanes.

The private car ﬂeet is predominant; about 469 cars for every 1,000 citizens were
available in 2000. The ﬂeet growth in thirty years was about 184%, with a yearly
growth rate of about 3.5%; this growth has slowed but not stopped.

In the United States, car density has reached 750 cars per 1,000 citizens and is
now steady; statistics show, in fact, that new car sales largely keep pace with written
off units.

Although this density is not inevitable for the European Union, the ﬂeet there was
still growing, and countries whose economies are growing fast are showing higher

rates, such as Greece, with 9.2%, Portugal, with 7.3%, Spain, with 6.9%, while
countries with a more mature economy show lower rates, such as Denmark, with
1.8%, and Sweden, with 1.9%.

The highest car density in the year 2000 was reached in Luxemburg with 616
cars/1000 persons (corresponding to 1.62 cars per citizen), Italy with 563 cars/person
and Germany with 522 cars/person.

Table 17.3 shows a time series of the ratio of cars per 1,000 citizen in Europe; at
the beginning of the motoring era, would have shown a ﬁgure of 300,000 citizens
per car in 1899 in Italy; from that time on the index increase was continuous, except
during the two world wars in 1915–18 and 1939–45, when the total ﬂeet decreased.

In 2003 this index has increased to 666 cars/1,000 citizen.

A second bar chart shows the breakdown according to the different body types.
Cars segments show no substantial variation; in terms of type, Fig. 17.10 shows a
constant decline of saloons, with a simultaneous growth of what were once considered
niche segments, such as monospace, sport utility vehicles (SUV) and crossovers.

Diesel engines, introduced into mass production after the Second World War, have
suffered from ﬁscal and regulatory intervention; at this time their ﬂeet share is about
24%, while their market share is 44% (Source ANFIA).

By analyzing and elaborating ﬂeet characteristics, some information on expected
life can be gathered; the task is particularly difﬁcult because many data referring to
the past are missing or are not comparable with present information.

As an example we can look at Table 17.4, where the car ﬂeet of some European
Countries is classiﬁed according to the number of cars per family, the average own-
ership period and the average distance travelled per year according to the fuel type.
The age of cars in a given Country is calculated by averaging the age of cars sold
in given year assuming their percentage on the total operating ﬂeet as weight. The
average cars age of the 25 European Countries in 2015 ranged from 6.2 years in
Luxenburg to 17.2 in Poland, with an average of 10.7 in Europe, as it is shown in
Fig. 17.11. The cars age is strongly affected by economics: For instance, in Italy, the
average age of the running ﬂeet went from 32.8% of cars older than 10 years in 2002,
to 51.6% in 2015.

In the European Union the average age for cars was about 8 years in 2002.
The estimate of vehicle expected life is therefore hard to predict; but barring major
changes, an expected life of 15 years for cars and 20 years for industrial vehicles
would be a reasonable forecast.

The expected evolution of emission and passive safety regulations could promote a
shorter life, increasing ﬂeet obsolescence. Macroeconomics should not be forgotten.

Fig. 17.11 The average cars age of the 25 European Countries in 2015 ranged from 6.2 years in
Luxenburg to 17.2 in Poland with an average of 10.7 in Europe Source ACEA

The yearly distance covered by a vehicle can be estimated by dividing trafﬁc
volume by the number of operating vehicles and available places; in reality, not
many vehicles operate at maximum capacity.

For example, in the European Union, cars delivered a trafﬁc volume of 4,719
Gpass×km (see Fig. 17.2) with a working ﬂeet of about 252,000,000 units
(see Fig. 17.1); by crediting each car with ﬁve places, we would obtain about
3,800 km/year.

The so-called occupation factor should be taken into account; it is deﬁned as
the ratio between occupied and available places; statistical surveys measured a mere
26.5% for this value, reducing total occupation to only 1.33 passengers per car.

The average yearly distance covered is therefore about 14,000 km.
A reasonable estimate for a car’s life expectancy, therefore, should be close to

200,000 km.

Following the same process for other vehicle categories, we obtain:

(cid:129) more than 400,000 km for buses;
(cid:129) more than 800,000 km for long haul trucks.

17.3 Social Impact

As we have seen, transportation has a strong bearing on daily life. In year 2000,
every morning European Union services had to move more than 150 millions people
to their working places and to return them to their homes in the evening, as well as
serving longer routes; in addition, about 50,000,000 tons of freight were transported
every day.

Considering passenger trafﬁc only, each citizen traveled approximately 12,700 km
per year, using all available means of transportation; as a consequence, transportation
is highly relevant to how people live.

We will consider in the following sections as indicators of the social impact of

transportation:
(cid:129) accidents attributable to the use of transportation means;
(cid:129) emissions of primary pollutant products;
(cid:129) jobs offered by this economic sector;
(cid:129) tax revenue generated by the transportation system.

As far as energy consumption is concerned, we refer to the previous section on

this topic.

We will take into account mainly motor vehicles, our main ﬁeld of interest, report-

ing also some reference data for other means of transportation.

17.3.1 Accidents

Like all human activities, road transportation involves risks and the number of acci-
dents caused by the use of motor vehicles is remarkable in all countries of the world.
Their economic and human cost is high enough that the objective of increasing

vehicle safety is generally considered a social and technical priority.

To evaluate the extent of these damages it may be useful to report a statistic on
causes of death in the United States; these data could be similar to those in any other
developed country.

These ﬁgures for 2016 are shown on Table. 17.5. The number of fatalities con-

nected to road transportation is second only to that caused by drug poisoning.6

Fig. 17.12 Time series of fatalities caused by road accidents in the European Union Source Eurostat

According to the World Health Organizations (WHO), road accidents annually
caused approximately 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2010; one fourth of all deaths
caused by injury (see Table 17.6). Also about 50 million persons are injured in trafﬁc
accidents. A study from the American Automobile Association (AAA) concluded
that car crashes cost the United States $300 billion per year.

In the European Union, transportation accidents caused 50 fatalities per million
inhabitants in the year 2016; about 5.2 fatality/Gpass×km or 100 fatalities per million
passenger car.

Figure 17.12 shows a summary of this worrying situation.
Total fatalities are fortunately decreasing, notwithstanding the trafﬁc volume
increase; this result is attributable to better driving education, infrastructure improve-
ment and increased vehicle passive safety owing to the strict regulations.

The total road fatalities occurred about 59% on cars, 18% on motorcycles and

10% on bicycles, as shown on the pie chart in Fig. 17.13.

Referring fatalities to different passenger trafﬁc volumes, we obtain the following

mortality rates7:
(cid:129) 9.5 × 10−9 deaths/pass×km, for road transportation (more precisely: 0.7×10−9
deaths/pass×km for buses, 7×10−9 deaths/pass×km for cars, 13.8×10−9
deaths/pass×km for motorcycles, 54×10−9 deaths/pass×km for bicycles and
64×10−9
deaths/pass×km for pedestrians);

(cid:129) 0.35×10−9 deaths/pass×km, for railway transportation;
(cid:129) 0.35×10−9 deaths/pass×km, for air transportation.

Air transportation poses a challenge; one might consider accidents occurring
inside the borders of the European Union, or accidents occurring to European airlines,
whether inside the Union or abroad. Only European citizens might be considered or
any person involved.

If we consider that most accidents occur near airports, the different counting poli-
cies give different conclusions. Moreover, these accidents, fortunately few, ﬂuctuate
over time and are difﬁcult to average meaningfully.

The reported ﬁgure refers to all accidents occurring in 2002 within the borders of

the European Union.

Returning to road transportation, accident severity has also decreased, as we can
conclude by examining Fig. 17.14 showing the time series of the ratios between
non-fatal injuries and deaths.

17.3.2 Emissions

The main pollutants emitted by the combustion of oil reﬁnery products, in general,
and by road trafﬁc, in particular—all demonstrated to be harmful for public health—
are the following:
(cid:129) carbon monoxide (CO);
(cid:129) nitrogen oxides (NOx );
(cid:129) non-methane organic compounds (NMOC);
(cid:129) particulate matter (PM).

In recent times other gases have been added to the list; these are not directly
harmful, but contribute to creating the so-called greenhouse effect. They are known,
therefore, as greenhouse gases (GHG).

28

17 Transportation Statistics

Fig. 17.14 Time series of the ratio between non-fatal injuries and deaths due to road accidents in
the European Union Source Eurostat

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a ﬂavorless, colorless and poisonous gas; if exchanged
with blood hemoglobin, in the lungs, it impairs the quantity of oxygen delivered to
body organs and tissues.

A signiﬁcant quantity of CO emission is produced by gasoline engine combustion
and, therefore, by cars; all combustion processes of organic fuels that are incomplete
for lack of oxygen contribute to the production of CO. Such contributions are many,
including other gasoline engines (motorcycles, etc.), diesel engines, incinerators and
homes.

Figure 17.15 shows a CO breakdown by source as estimated for the European

Union in the year 2000.

These values are constantly decreasing because of the conversion to natural gas of
many wood-burning furnaces, and because of the regulation on vehicle emissions that
reduced the allowed limits, for example, for gasoline engine cars from 4.05 g/km, in
1992, to 1 g/km from 2005; the introduction of catalysts in 1992 had already reduced
CO emission by ten times.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx ) are made by mixing NO and NO2 and are the result of
the combination of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen due to combustion processes
at high temperature and pressure; we can, therefore, say that the more efﬁcient the
combustion process, the higher the rate of nitrogen oxide formation. For this reason
fuel consumption and CO2 emission reductions conﬂict with reduced emissions of
NOx .

A second major source of NOx is nitrate salts used in agriculture, which produce

acids emitting nitrogen in the presence of water.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) irritates the lungs and can reduce their resistance to infec-

tion, with increased risk for bronchitis and pneumonia.

Contributions to this pollutant are many, as shown in Fig. 17.16, again based on

the year 2000.

We should remark that NOx , together with NMOC are also precursors of com-
plex chemical reaction leading to the formation of ozone (O3) into the low altitude
atmosphere, proven to be noxious to human health.

Anthropogenic sources of this pollutant are many; also in this case there is a clear
trend to decrease. The evolution of vehicle regulation has reduced NOx limits from
0.78 g/km in 1992, to 0.06 g/km (petrol) or 0.08 g/km (diesel) in 2014.

30

17 Transportation Statistics

Fig. 17.17 NMHC breakdown by source, in the European Union in the year 2000 Source ACEA

Figure 17.17 shows a similar diagram for NMOC; the evaporation of fuels and

solvents is a major contributor.

NMOC also follows a decreasing trend; vehicle regulations have reduced levels

from 0.66 g/km to 0.068 g/km for gasoline engines in the period 1992–2014.

Particulate matter is a mix of particles of different size that is harmful to health; it
is also damaging to exposed materials and can reduce visibility. It is usually classiﬁed
according to the average diameter of particles involved; these are suspended in the
atmosphere and precipitate very slowly. The most noxious particulates are those
suspended in the atmosphere.

PM-10 indicates particles smaller than 10 µm, while PM-2,5 refers to sizes smaller

than 2,5 µm.

The smaller the particle the greater the risk for human health. Extended exposure
to these particles affects breathing, can worsen existing pulmonary diseases and
increases cancer risk.

Beyond combustion products, particles also contain dust, ash, smoke and airborne
droplets. If not washed away by rain or artiﬁcial means, powders on the ground can
again become airborne due to natural wind or passing vehicles.

PM also follows a decreasing trend; vehicle regulations have reduced levels from

0.08 to 0.005 g/km in the period 1996–2014.

Figure 17.18 shows a breakdown of the main sources of PM-10.
Gasses contributing to the greenhouse effect (GHG) include a basket of six chem-
ical compounds that were identiﬁed in the ﬁnal document of the Kyoto protocol;
these are: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), chloroﬂu-
orocarbons (HFC), perﬂuorocarbons (PFC) and SF6.

All these gasses, if diffused into the atmosphere, limit infrared radiation, con-

tributing to an increase in the atmosphere’s average temperature.

They are measured according to their heating potential, which is reported as CO2
equivalent; their quantity is multiplied by weights pi , which express the carbon
dioxide equivalent.

The weights are the following: pCO2

HFC and PFC include two large families of different gasses, each with its own weight.

GHG emissions are strongly correlated to the population: France, Germany, Italy

= 21, pNO2

= 1, pCH4

and the United Kingdom account for more than 50% of the total for Europe.

These emissions can be reduced only by reducing the burning of fossil fuels.
For this reason, the European Union legislation set mandatory reduction targets

for new cars; in fact cars are responsible for around 12% of total CO2.

8These data are unfortunately not consistent with the others, because they refer to the European
Union as extended to 25 countries.

32

17 Transportation Statistics

The 2015 and 2021 targets represent reductions of 18% and 40% respectively,
compared with the 2007 ﬂeet average emission ﬁgure of 158.7 g/km (car emission
weighted on sales volume).

The average emissions level of a new car sold in 2017 was 118.5 g/km, signiﬁcantly

below the 2015 target of 130 g/km.

Starting from this achievement, the ﬂeet average has now been set at 95 g/km, in
force from year 2020. This means a sale-averaged fuel consumption of around 4.1
l/100 km of petrol or 3.6 l/100 km of diesel.

Electric vehicles, we will introduce in a following chapter, are considered by the

public opinion as the ﬁnal solution for solving all emission problems.

In fact there should be no doubt CO, NMOC, NOx and PM emissions will be
consistently reduced by driving electric cars: power station emissions could be more
easily treated than by car exhaust systems and they are less polluting by nature,
deriving from a low pressure combustion process. A similar conclusion is not com-
pletely true as far as CO2 emission is considered because no low cost after treatment
technology exists yet for this pollutant.

France, Norway or Sweden that show very low values because of the high number
of their nuclear or hydroelectric power stations and other as Poland, Germany or the
United Kingdom, where the incidence of petroleum power station is quite substantial.

The Union average emission is about 400 g/kWh.
This means, for example, that an electric mid size car, able to operate with speciﬁc
energy of 25 kWh/100 km on the reference driving cycle, is releasing about 125 g/km
of CO2—non much better than the 2015 emission target for its internal combustion
engine counterparts.

Finally we should remember that air pollution is a phenomenon preceding devel-
opment of the automobile, especially in urban environments and it has been declining
for many years.

If public perception has increased, this is due more to the evolution of laws, than

the problem per se.

Figure 17.21 shows an interesting diagram reporting SO2 and smoke evolution
recorded in London during the last four centuries; for the period up to 1920 an
estimate based on coal consumption has been reported, while ﬁgures after that date
are certain.

Urban pollution decreased considerably in the second half of the past century and

is now lower than at any time in the last 400 years.

Similar diagrams are available for all major towns; on the other hand, towns of

recent development show curves that are still increasing.

Vehicle Functions

18.1 System Design

The goal of a system approach to vehicle design is to deﬁne the technical speciﬁ-
cations of each component, in such a way that the vehicle, as a whole, performs its
functions according to assigned procedures and objectives.

By technical speciﬁcations, we mean a set of physical measurements that deﬁne

each part, completely without the use of detailed drawings.

The system approach to design allows a project, even the most elaborate one,
to be carried out by assigning activities to teams working in parallel, each with
comprehensible objectives that can be checked autonomously, and ﬁnalized to the
overall performance of the vehicle. The system approach also allows a project to
be developed, using standard components produced by suppliers, these components
being developed for the purpose or chosen from a catalogue.

Finally, the system design is the initial phase of each project, when the feasibility
of reaching the assigned targets is veriﬁed; this phase is usually called a feasibility
study. The technical speciﬁcations of the main components are part of the concept
documentation.

In the continuation of this section we will try to explain how to assign and measure

overall vehicle performance and functions.

Unfortunately, performance and functions cannot be deﬁned absolutely, because
they are conditioned by the customer’s expectations of the product, and these expec-
tations depend on both objective and subjective parameters. Nor may we forget that
these expectations are conditioned by product alternatives existing on the market
when the product will be sold, alternatives which are usually unknown when the
project is launched.

Let us consider a vehicle’s climate system as an example.
Some functions of primary importance are easily identiﬁed.
We can assume that the objective of the climate system is to allow the passenger
compartment to reach an assigned comfort temperature in a given time, notwithstand-
ing the existing outside temperature. In reality, this time (cool-down or warm-up time)
is only an approximate parameter; we would not want ideal comfort temperatures to
be reached too quickly, causing passenger discomfort due to too strong a ﬂow of air
on the skin or high temperature gradients in the air.

Heat ﬂux on passengers appears to be a matter of judgement, further complicating

our understanding of the phenomenon.

In a luxury car, it might be mandatory to obtain comfort conditions automatically,
requiring the passenger to adjust temperature control only. A few years ago it would
have been a wild guess to design a multi-zone climate system for medium or small
cars. Nevertheless this feature is beginning to appear in these cars and could became
standard in the near future; when such systems were designed, they may have seemed
a waste of time and money.

On next generation medium cars, automatic outside odor abatement could become
indispensable. The abatement efﬁciency of various odorous reference substances
should therefore be deﬁned and measured.

In this connection, it should be remembered that too ambitious a speciﬁcation
could increase the product cost in ways that could prove to be unrecoverable in the
ﬁnal price.

Likewise, there are other functions that, although of secondary importance, cannot
be neglected and, sometimes, impact other systems. They could be designed, for
example, with goals like these:
• to reduce fuel consumption due to the climate system to a minimum;
• to reduce to a minimum the power required to the engine, especially during sudden

acceleration;

• to minimize the noise of air ﬂux into the passenger compartment;
• to control humidity, so as not to fog the windshield or side windows, etc.

Thus we see that in an apparently simple case, it can be very difﬁcult to identify
functions and speciﬁcations and that this identiﬁcation should be done only after a
careful study of customer expectations, which are in part a priori and in part depend
on the competitor’s products.

It is also difﬁcult to deﬁne the boundaries of the climate system, or to identify

which components inﬂuence the climate system by their behavior.

As a matter of fact, in a traditional approach, the climate system would be limited

to:
• the heat exchange group, including the heater and the evaporator, the air channels
and nozzles that direct the conditioned air to the passenger compartment, a part of
the body system;

• the compressor, a part of the engine system;
• the electronic control box, a part of the electric system.

But, if we try to improve our control over climate system functions, this list should
be expanded to include, for example, windows and windshield, responsible for an
important part of the radiated heat; door panels, responsible for part of the transmitted
heat; seats, as they inﬂuence human body heat exchange; and gearbox transmission
ratios for their inﬂuence on engine warm-up.

18.1 System Design

37

The boundaries of the technical speciﬁcation inﬂuencing a certain function are

wide and exceed the boundaries of the components dedicated to this function.

We suggest that a correct approach to system design should include, at least, the

following steps.

1. To deﬁne the functions performed by the system.
2. To deﬁne the parameters that best measure those functions and the target values

they should reach to obtain customer satisfaction.

3. To deﬁne which components are part of the system, because they inﬂuence the

achievement of the target values.

4. To identify other system functions, if any, in competition with those of point 1.
5. For each component, to establish a set of technical speciﬁcations coherent with

the system function target values.

Therefore system engineering implies the study of components that are normally
classiﬁed under different automotive engineering disciplines; in the example of the
climate system, we ﬁnd components that are part of the body, the powertrain and of
the electric system; these components are usually located in different sub-assemblies
of the car.

The chassis system design we will study in this book is similar. We will study,
for example, dynamic performance; a major factor here is the car’s top speed. For a
correct system approach, we will study not only the transmission as a component of
the chassis, but also engine speciﬁcations (part of the powertrain), and aerodynamic
resistance (part of the body system).

If engineering subjects are, by their nature, interdisciplinary, system engineering

must likewise exceed the boundaries of its individual subjects.

A traditional, topological approach, on the other hand, classiﬁes and studies vehi-

cles according to three main subsystems.
• The chassis, as the cluster of components dedicated to vehicle path control, such
as transmission, suspension, brakes, wheels and steering mechanism, with their
dedicated supporting structures.

• The powertrain, as the cluster of components dedicated to traction power genera-

tion, such as engine, fuel supply, intake and exhaust plants.

• The body, as the structure supporting all other components including the passenger

and payload compartment.

This book, dedicated to chassis system design, will consider all those functions that
are primary to the chassis; nevertheless, while studying a function such as dynamic
performance, we will also consider some aspects of the engine and the body or, in
terms of automatic system controls, we will consider some issues interfacing with
the electric and electronic system.

System design is necessarily rough, because it only studies the baseline spec-
iﬁcations of the components included in the system; design details of the same
components are left to specialists in each.

This approach will be useful not only to engineers, but to anyone involved in a

new vehicle development process.

18 Vehicle Functions

18.1.1 Functions Perceived by Customers

Let us consider all functions performed by the vehicle, with particular reference to
automobiles.

Vehicle functions can be deﬁned as the categories by which the customer rates

A complete list of functions, probably to be expanded in the future, can include

vehicle performance.

the following:
• Appearance.
• Available space.
• Ergonomics.
• Climate comfort.
• Dynamic comfort.
• Dynamic performance.
• Handling.
• Safety.
• Resistance to age.

Each function can be explained through a certain set of requirements, which are
qualitative and quantitative attributes that the vehicle must possess to perform each
function correctly; we will describe these requirements shortly.

The ﬁrst listed function (this list is not ranked by priority) is appearance, the
ability to appeal to the customer; even if this attribute is beyond the scope of this
book, we will say the pertinent requirements involve the body, in terms of shape,
volume, materials and details.

The contribution of the chassis to this function is marginal but not negligible
and includes tire and wheel size, a part of car appearance; the engine also gives
contributes through its proper lay-out with an open hood, or through hood shapes
and ventilation openings.

Roominess, or, from a designer point of view, the use of space, is important,

because it embodies the primary objective of carrying people and goods.

Customers don’t expect unlimited room; depending on the class of the car they are
interested in what is important is how much limited space can be rationally used. The
room expended on car components is unavailable for this use; component lay-out
should be designed to limit as much as possible any intrusion into the passenger com-
partment. This explains why we spent so much time on transmission and suspension
bulk in the ﬁrst volume.

Other important requirements also hinge on body design, such as roominess and
availability of space to organize small objects; another important requirement is
adaptability (tilting or removable seats), in order to enable the customer to change
the car interior to suit different transportation needs.

Car ergonomics can be deﬁned as the ability to minimize the physical activity
required by a given operation while using the car. Within this function, we usually

18.1 System Design

39

include the pleasure of driving the car, including the many sensations the customer
feels while driving.

The requirements of this function again involve the car body and include:

• ease of entering and exiting the car for driver and passengers, of opening and

closing doors, the glove compartment, hood, trunk, etc.;

• ease of identifying and reaching the most important controls with minimal reach;
• comfort of the driver’s posture;
• ease of loading and unloading transported goods.

Chassis design is primarily affected by the requirements established for car con-
trols such as the steering wheel, gear shift stick, clutch and brake pedals; these have
to do with their operating force, the placement of the controls and the feeling per-
ceived by their operation. Any control, in fact, not only receives an input that should
be minimally tiring, but returns a feed-back that should inform the driver about the
correct accomplishment of the maneuvers.

We commented about climate comfort in our example. In this case as well, the

related requirements affect body design and, partially, the engine.

The dynamic comfort function is evaluated by the ability to suppress all acoustic
and vibration nuisances from outside (road pavement and other vehicles) and from
inside (engine operation and component vibration).

The related requirements involve almost all vehicle components, as they partici-

pate as sources and potential transmitters of such disturbances.

Noise and vibration contain information useful for both driver and passengers. A
totally silent vehicle, without vibrations, could prove to be dangerous, as has been
demonstrated by experience with active noise suppression. In addition, some noise
is peculiar to particular types of car, as, for example, sports cars.

The target is not total suppression but an acoustic environment compliant with

customer expectations.

Filtering of component vibration is a task usually assigned to the body system,
while ﬁltering noise and vibrations from the road is usually assigned to the wheels
and suspension.

Filtering powertrain noise (engine operation) involves powertrain suspension and

the intake and exhaust system.

Unbalance speciﬁcations are assigned to any potential source of vibration.
The dynamic performance function includes requirements that are easy to mea-
sure, such as top speed, gradeability, acceleration and pick-up. Requirements that
are more difﬁcult to evaluate meaningfully are drivability and fuel economy.

Requirements involve all chassis components from the engine to the body and, in

general, the entire vehicle.

Handling functions are usually deﬁned as the vehicle’s ability to follow driver
inputs on the controls, when modifying car speed or trajectory; these controls include
separate or combined operations on the steering wheel, brakes and accelerator.

Handling function requirements involve not only suspension, tires, steering mech-
anism and brakes, but also engine and transmission. Overall properties of inertia
(mass and momentum) have vital importance for this function.

40

18 Vehicle Functions

The safety function is usually classiﬁed in three ways:

1. preventive safety, such as the ability of the vehicle to keep the driver constantly
updated on corrective maneuvers to be undertaken; a typical example of this
category includes not only outside visibility, visibility of the main instruments
(i.e., speedometer, outside thermometer, etc.) but also car trim variations;

2. active safety, such as the ability of the vehicle to react to driver inputs with a
response that should be immediate, stable and proportional to the action, while
avoiding obstacles or dangerous situations;

3. passive safety, such as the ability to limit, when a collision is unavoidable, the
severity of injuries to car occupants, to pedestrians or to passengers of other cars,
involved in the collision.

Safety cannot be, by deﬁnition, total, but requirements should be established for
the most statistically relevant situations; homologation requirements are an important
part of this approach, together with manufacturer’s technical policies. In the passive
safety category, repair cost limitations following low speed collisions have been
added recently.

Safety involves all main vehicle components; the body is particularly involved in
preventive (inside and outside visibility, lights) and passive safety (structures, passive
and active restraint systems, component lay-out, surface materials and ﬁnishing).

The chassis must comply with all active safety requirements for suspension, brakes
and tires, and with passive safety requirements, such as intrusion into the passenger
compartment following a collision.

The engine system is involved in passive safety as far as fuel spills after crashes

and consequent ﬁre hazards are concerned.

The aging resistance function is the ability of vehicle system and components to
maintain their functions unchanged or to limit their degradation with aging within
acceptable limits; reliability is a requirement of this function. Aging resistance
involves all vehicle components and, obviously, all chassis components.

18.1.2 Technical Speciﬁcations

Each vehicle function can be described through a coherent set of measurable require-
ments; compliance with them guarantees customer satisfaction with the vehicle.
These requirements determine the technical speciﬁcations of all components.
Each part or subassembly could be fully deﬁned by an engineering drawing,
containing all relevant geometric dimensions and materials. In reality, the detailed
knowledge of complex components is irrelevant to the car manufacturer, who is
more interested in performance than speciﬁcations. A very detailed drawing cannot
always guarantee complete fulﬁllment of the desired performance. In many cases,
car manufacturers lack the technical competencies to understand complex details.

18.1 System Design

41

Technical speciﬁcations solve this problem by providing global and synthetic
information only; it is therefore necessary to establish, for any given component,
what is relevant for system function. A technical speciﬁcation should list:
• what physical properties describe the requirements requested for the component;
• in which conditions those properties must be measured;
• what values (with allowed tolerance) they must assume to obtain the desired system

performance.

These technical speciﬁcations, together with simple outline drawings, represent
the only technical documentation useful for managing the relationship between car
and component manufacturer.

The component manufacturer’s point of view is necessarily different, since he must
create technical documents to produce the needed part consistently. After all it isn’t
rare that some second tier supplier is producing other parts that will be integrated
into the ﬁnal subassembly. The ﬁrst tier supplier must therefore use his technical
speciﬁcations to advantage.

Consider the example of a tire.
The vehicle system utilizes the tire to express forces on the wheel along the three
directions (vertical, longitudinal and transverse); tire technical speciﬁcations will
examine these three parameters ﬁrst.

A reasonable approach to tire speciﬁcation might be to determine maximum
allowed values for these directions and magic formulae coefﬁcients; their values
can be calculated by mathematical models directly or interpreted by these models as
applied to satisfactory results of experiments performed on the car.

Other speciﬁcations could describe the tire’s age resistance, with acceptable values

of tread wear using certain missions as reference.

The ﬁgures of vertical elasticity and damping close this speciﬁcation list.
The common characteristics of these parameters are:

• they must be correlated with the function we wish to embed in on the vehicle;
• they must be overseen by the supplier, who is the manufacturer, without implying

a detailed knowledge of the application.

Other characteristics, such as, for example, the chemical composition of cord
ﬁbers applied to the tread, are not generally involved in vehicle operation and, if
they are, the link between chemical composition and system behavior is part of the
proprietary know-how of the supplier.

Technical speciﬁcations, therefore, deﬁne the performance that we want to obtain,

but not the details that allow us to obtain this performance.

On the other hand, speciﬁcations should not be too superﬁcial; for example, we
should not make the mistake of providing a supplier speciﬁcations on road durability
without referring to the driving conditions and the typical trip in question; a good
speciﬁcation should enable the supplier to personally evaluate these factors.

Continuing with the tire example, it is clear that the technical documents available
to the supplier will be much more detailed than those used by the car manufacturer as
technical speciﬁcations; the supplier will have available a complete set of drawings

42

18 Vehicle Functions

of the tread, including detailed dimensions, cord texture, materials, ﬁxtures and
production set-up, etc. The design tools of the supplier will be able to correlate these
parameters with tire performance on the vehicle system which are almost coincident
with the technical speciﬁcations.

Some details, such as wires included in the body—whose performance is not only
dependent on reference dimensions (diameter) but also on the manufacturing process
in the steel mill—should be described by speciﬁcations including only diameter, yield
and the physical properties of their surface.

Technical speciﬁcations represent a universal simpliﬁed language, allowing such
different industrial organizations as ﬁnal manufacturer and supplier to cooperate in
reaching the same objective, the ﬁnal customer satisfaction.

The same logic can be usefully applied within a company, particularly a vehicle

manufacturer, to integrate the activities of different departments.

Although there is no conceptual obstacle to developing each component from
scratch, it is always useful, before taking this decision, to clarify which function the
component performs on the vehicle, how it can be quantiﬁed, and from which values
the objective of satisfying the customer is obtained.

In this way it is possible to manage, with relative simplicity, complex activities
involving a number of people, breaking down each objective into sub-objectives that
are measurable and understandable by the different parties involved.

18.1.3 Chassis System Design

We have seen that the automotive chassis contributes to the following vehicle func-
tions:
• dynamic performance;
• handling;
• ride and acoustic comfort;
• ergonomics;
• safety.

The engine and transmission relate to dynamic performance, in terms of available
power; the body (aerodynamic resistance), tires (rolling resistance), transmission
(mechanical efﬁciency) and mass properties of the vehicle involve dynamic perfor-
mance in terms of absorbed power.

Handling and active safety are inﬂuenced by suspension and steering system
geometry, by brake design and by the elastic properties of tires; the transmission
determines the interaction between cornering and traction forces. Chassis control
systems play a fundamental role.

Ride comfort is inﬂuenced by disturbances, essentially vibrations, coming from
tire-ground contact and is affected by suspension geometry, by the elastic and damp-
ing properties of springs, bushings and shock absorbers, and by the vertical properties
of tires.

18.1 System Design

43

Acoustic comfort, on the other hand, requires a notable development of our knowl-
edge of body structure and trim. For this reason, this function is usually studied in
body design.

As far as controls are concerned, ergonomics involves chassis design: the steering
system, brake and transmission (clutch and shift stick); control systems contribute
to this function through power assistance and automatic transmissions.

Passive safety involves chassis design and component intrusion into the passenger
compartment and structure; since most cars have a body that includes in a single shell
both chassis and body structures, we generally study this function as part of body
design.

The objective of the design methods explained in this book dedicated to chassis
design is therefore to design chassis components that satisfy the above functions at
the vehicle system level.

The adequacy of these methods might appear at least partially unsatisfying,
because we will explain how to verify which function an assigned vehicle is able
to perform; we will also identify which components condition those functions but
not how these components must be speciﬁed in order to perform the functions at the
desired level. We are able to tackle this problem only a posteriori, while an a priori
approach would be desirable.

This qualiﬁcation could apply to all design courses, because if designing means
to deﬁne a product that does not yet exist, what is really taught is to verify whether
an already deﬁned product is able to perform an assigned function.

The designer’s job is, therefore, to assume an hypothesis and to verify the results
that can be achieved; a deviation from the objective will guide to deﬁne a different
hypothesis that will again be veriﬁed. The designer will be more efﬁcient, if the ﬁrst
approximation hypothesis is close to correct, but, in any case, design will remain a
trial and error process.

A technical speciﬁcation deﬁnition is further complicated by the fact that the ﬁnal
judgement on the product will be issued by the customer and not by the designer,
and customer judgments are sometimes difﬁcult to express concretely, because they
are inﬂuenced by unmeasurable parameters and alternative offers on the market that
may be unknown at the beginning of the development process.

Technical speciﬁcations are developed and determined through different strate-
gies, according to a process that can be divided into two parts, called target setting
and target deployment. The target setting phase consists in setting objectives for
each of the functions perceived by the customer; this job will be more fruitful if
subjective judgements are avoided and only objective measurements are used. If this
requirement appears easy to be met for functions like top speed, acceleration, and
gradeability, it will be difﬁcult for functions like handling, where subjective feelings
come into play.

We will see in the following paragraphs how subjective feelings can be trans-

formed into objective measurements.

44

18 Vehicle Functions

In the next phase of target deployment, as a ﬁrst step, vehicle subsystems according
to function are identiﬁed and their speciﬁcations tentatively set; the speciﬁcations
adequacy to the targets will be veriﬁed, correcting any errors in the speciﬁcation.

These veriﬁcations may be performed using mathematical models of the vehicle
and in some cases also by building and testing simpliﬁed prototypes (mule cars) that
will allow complex subsystems to be veriﬁed.

18.2 Objective Requirements

If we want to deﬁne vehicle functions and, particularly, measure the main require-
ments that determine those functions, we must refer to the test procedures used for
this purpose; vehicle objectives are, in fact, set with reference to those procedures.
We commonly identify objective and subjective requirements. The ﬁrst ones are
directly measurable with the instruments of classic physics; the second are deter-
mined only by the satisfaction of the ﬁnal vehicle user, but they can be converted
into objective measurements through statistical investigations of customer groups.

A classic example of an objective target might be the time to accelerate the vehicle
in top gear from one speed to a higher one. This is easily measurable, when reference
conditions (road grade, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, etc.) and load conditions
are set. This test can be performed by a professional driver who is able to achieve
repeatable results; each test, even a simple one, is inﬂuenced by driving behavior.

If we want to deﬁne the customer satisfaction level, we should ask ourselves
how it can be measured and if it depends on this requirement only; if that is the case,
satisfaction will be inﬂuenced by the customer’s expectations, depending on the class
of the car, driving habits, etc.

The required objective follows from a statistical study of the reaction of a group of
customers driving this car; the study of customer satisfaction on different question-
naires leads to signiﬁcant data derived from subjective measurements. The customer
sample must include only people likely to be ﬁnal customers of the car under devel-
opment.

We will refer in this paragraph only to objective measurements of vehicle perfor-

mance involving the chassis, which are, as we have seen:
• dynamic performance;
• handling and active safety;
• ride comfort;
• ergonomics;
• passive safety.

For each of these we will comment on test procedures and measurable data; we

will consider passive safety only when speaking about regulations.

18.2 Objective Requirements

45

18.2.1 Dynamic Performance

For this kind of test it is necessary, for safety reasons, to use test tracks closed to
public trafﬁc.

Speed and acceleration tests should be performed on a ﬂat straight road that is
long enough to accomplish all tests reliably; a launch ramp should also be available
that allows the vehicle to reach top speed before its measurement.

Sufﬁciently long constant slope roads, at different inclination angles, should be

available for gradeability tests.

Loop tracks can be used to simulate road trips that are particularly signiﬁcant for
vehicle use; according to the know-how of each manufacturer, these tracks allow,
while driving following certain rules, the measurement of average speeds and fuel
consumption comparable to real values.

Because engine performance is inﬂuenced by air density and humidity, climate
conditions during such tests are signiﬁcant; a suitable condition is an outside tem-
perature in the range between 10 and 30 ◦C, with no wind and rain.

As an alternative to the test track, subject to variable climate conditions and,
therefore, not always available, roller benches can be used, allowing electric brakes
with electronic control to simulate vehicle driving resistance on the road; in this
case, the car is driven according to an assigned speed time history. This practice is
particularly useful for measuring fuel consumption.

A roller bench, when contained in a pressure and temperature controlled chamber,
allows dynamic performance to be measured at temperature and altitude conditions
different from those available outside.

Test vehicles must be driven for a certain distance (about 5,000 km) after assembly
to stabilize mechanical frictions and tire rolling resistance, since these parameters
are subject to a certain settling depending on surface wear.

Since performance also depends on transported weight, it is necessary to control
this value within a statistically meaningful tolerance; usually two passengers (includ-
ing driver) and 20 kg of baggage are used for testing. For industrial and commercial
vehicles the full load condition is considered.

The instruments used in these tests are quite simple, as far as speeds are concerned:
they include optical devices to actuate stop-watches that measure driving times, while
distance driven is determined by the position of these devices along the track.

Fuel consumption is measured by volumetric ﬂow meters on the engine feed
pipeline; in this case the recycled ﬂow to the fuel reservoir must also be taken into
account; sometimes an auxiliary tank is applied that is weighted before and after the
test.

The best-known dynamic performance is top speed, which is the maximum vehicle

speed on a ﬂat road, after a reasonably long launch ramp.

Acceleration is usually deﬁned as the time necessary to reach a predetermined
speed (usually 100 km/h or 60 mph), starting from a still condition, using the gearbox,
at full throttle; sometimes it is also measured as the time necessary to cover a ﬁxed
distance (usually 1 km or 1
4 mile), starting from a still position, using the gearbox,

46

18 Vehicle Functions

at full throttle. This kind of test must be repeated on a manual gearbox a number
of times, to allow the driver to identify the best strategy for working the controls,
because start-up and shift times inﬂuence the ﬁnal result.

By contrast, pick-up time is instead the time needed to increase the vehicle speed,
starting from an initial ﬁxed value, without using the shift stick but at full throttle. The
initial speed can be 50, 60, 70, or 80 km/h, while the ﬁnal one is usually 100 km/h;
the gear is usually the top one or, if different, the top speed gear. The distance driven
could also be used to measure this performance.

Gradeability is the maximum road slope at which the vehicle is able to start up and
be driven at constant speed, without slippage of the clutch; this value is approximated
according to the available slopes on the test track. The grade is measured by the
difference in elevation at the two ends of the test track, divided by the horizontal
projection of the track; this is the tangent of the longitudinal road inclination α.

Among the practices of manufacturers are reference loop drives on closed tracks
or open roads which allow one to evaluate road performance under controlled con-
ditions; in this case average speed or driving time are measured.

Increasingly congested trafﬁc conditions have distracted customer attention from
the performance obtained by intensive gearbox use, putting emphasis instead on
pick-up time at low speed; the most recent statistical surveys correlating subjective
judgements of performance favor this measure on short test distances.

This trend increases the importance of low speed (1,500−2,500 rpm) engine
torque, with reference to maximum power. It is therefore not inaccurate to include
drivability in the category of vehicle dynamic performance.

Drivability can be deﬁned as the vehicle’s ability to increase or decrease its traction

force quickly, without ﬂuctuation around the ﬁnal desired value.

At the beginning of the test, the throttle pedal is depressed or released starting

from a condition corresponding to the initial steady state reference speed.

Drivability is evaluated by examining the resulting car speed diagram as a function
of time after the input time on the accelerator pedal, or by measuring the longitudinal
vehicle acceleration. An objective evaluation parameter can be the number of peaks
of this diagram before the asymptotic value.

Vehicle drivability is not only inﬂuenced by engine torque oscillations, induced
by ﬂow transients into the intake and exhaust ducts, but also by the elastic torsional
stiffness of the driveline, from clutch to tires, and by the elasticity of powertrain and
car suspensions mounts.

Fuel consumption at constant speed is usually measured between 50 km/h and
top speed; the test is performed in top gear or, if different, on the top speed gear; this
test is quite simple, but has a very low correlation with practical vehicle use, where
speed variations and engine idling periods are very frequent.

For this reason, tests are always completed with a measurement of a driving
cycle; this test is usually performed on a roller bench, able to simulate driving trips
of different kinds; an important cycle will be described in the chapter on regulations.
It is a good practice to measure consumption at ambient temperatures different
from the reference condition (usually 20 ◦C) if the car is to be sold in countries where
this condition is not signiﬁcant; in this case, the effect of a cold start must also be

18.2 Objective Requirements

47

investigated. Consumption measurements can also be performed on the road, if there
is sufﬁcient control over ambient conditions.

18.2.2 Handling and Active Safety

Handling tests do not differ signiﬁcantly from active safety tests and are therefore
described together. This kind of test introduces a speciﬁc difﬁculty because on-road
maneuvers can be many and their number is increased if different road pavement and
conditions are to be considered.

Many manufacturers have adopted similar elementary maneuvers and most of
these have been standardized by the ISO. Standardization applies to the execution of
the maneuver only and sets no reference values for the output values to be measured.
The test track, usually a ﬂat square that can be ﬂooded under controlled conditions,
provides marked courses that cars must follow; in this way the consequences of
mistakes are not burdensome.

Cars are often equipped with roll-over protection provided by additional wheels

that contact the ground at high roll angles.

Vehicle instruments must be sophisticated because they have to measure dynamic

values for the vehicle; the essential ones include:
• lateral acceleration;
• yaw velocity;
• vehicle side slip angle;
• roll angle;
• vehicle speed.

For the deﬁnition of each see the Part Four of this volume.
A ﬁxed reference system is necessary to establish these values through instruments
installed on the vehicle; an inertial platform is therefore used that measures the six
components of rotation and displacement of the vehicle sprung mass with reference
to the ground.

In many tests a particular steering wheel able to measure steering angle and torque

is used.

Tests are classiﬁed as open-loop and closed-loop, with reference to the role of the
driver during the maneuvers. In the ﬁrst case, the driver manipulates vehicle con-
trols (steering wheel, brake and accelerator pedals) according to a preset procedure,
regardless of the result; in the second case the driver uses the controls as needed and
tries to obtain a speciﬁed objective, as, for example, driving along a course at the
highest possible speed.

The simplest open-loop maneuver is the steering pad (ISO 4138), where the

vehicle is driven around a circle at constant speed.

This is an open-loop maneuver because the controls are blocked during the test

period, to guarantee a steady state motion.

48

18 Vehicle Functions

Three different methods are considered depending on the skill of the driver, that

are substantially equivalent in result; these are:
• constant curvature radius,
• constant steering wheel angle,
• constant speed.

Since these are the three independent variables that deﬁne motion, their test results

can determine the remaining variables.

A typical value for the curvature radius could be 40 or 100 m; it is important that
tests are performed in such a way as to obtain different values of lateral acceleration,
starting from a very low one, which is useful to measure the Ackermann steering
wheel angle.

This test allows the evaluation of the steering index of the vehicle and the determi-
nation of roll angle as a function of lateral acceleration; a maximum allowed lateral
acceleration can be identiﬁed by a series of attempts.

We refer again to the fourth part of this volume for a deﬁnition of the parameters

involved in this test.

To evaluate vehicle stability while entering a curve and the steering wheel realign-

ment when exiting it, the lateral transient test (ISO 7401) is usually applied.

The car is stabilized on a straight road at 100 km/h or, if desired, at different
speeds; in the step input version, the steering wheel is suddenly turned to a preset
value; to simplify the maneuver, a steering wheel stop is set at the desired angle.

Without changing the accelerator pedal position, the steering wheel is kept turned

for a speciﬁed time.

Important evaluation parameters are the gradient of lateral acceleration and yaw
speed as a function of the steering wheel angle, the delay time between steering
wheel angle peak, and yaw speed peak and the presence of overshoots on the yaw
speed diagram (yaw speed peak higher than asymptotic value).

A variant of this maneuver is the application of a sinusoidal steering wheel input

applying, as input:
• random function,
• triangular function,
• sinusoidal function,

at different frequencies.

The complexity of this test is evident despite the schematic simplicity of this

transient motion between straight and curved steady-state motions.

The accelerator pedal release maneuver (ISO 9816) studies vehicle behavior
when the accelerator pedal is released, while driving on a curve; this maneuver
simulates what could happen if a driver attempts to drive at too high a speed.

It is possible to test vehicle stability and measure deviation from the original path.

This test can be performed at the end of the steering pad test.

18.2 Objective Requirements

49

Two different methods are available.

• At a constant course by stabilizing the vehicle on the assigned curvature radius
before releasing the accelerator pedal; the steady-state speed can be increased as
needed to investigate the inﬂuence of lateral acceleration.

• At constant speed, stabilizing at a certain speed on decreasing curvature radii.

The test output displays the interaction between the steering index, a function of
lateral acceleration, and the varying cornering stiffness of tires due to the instan-
taneous change of traction caused by braking. The engine shows a braking effect
increasing with initial rotation speed; the transient motion is affected by the selected
gear ratio.

During this open-loop test the steering wheel must be locked.
The evaluation parameters are the same as in the previous test, where longitudinal
acceleration has to be added; because the steering wheel is blocked, there will be a
deviation from the initial course after accelerator release; cars are usually designed
so as to close the path after the transient slightly, without sensible discontinuity from
the initial trajectory.

Still in the area of stability, the braking in a curve test (ISO 7975) has been
designed, to add the application of brakes to the above procedure. Also in this case
the steering wheel is again locked.

To the parameters of the previous test, braking ﬂuid pressure is added and the
deviation from the initial course could be signiﬁcant; the test is performed at increas-
ing longitudinal accelerations until one of the wheels is blocked or the ABS system
has started to work.

An important open-loop maneuver is the steering wheel release (ISO 17288); the
purpose of this test is to establish the vehicle’s ability to return to a straight path after
a curve.

The vehicle is stabilized on a steering pad at 100 km/h; path curvature is chosen
so as to maintain a lateral acceleration of about 1 ms−2 and the test is repeated for
growing acceleration values. At the beginning of the maneuver the steering wheel is
left free to turn under the action of the existing forces on the contact points of the
tires. The accelerator pedal is kept where it was at the beginning of the test.

The usual path parameters and the actual steering angle are acquired. Since steer-
ing wheel and lateral acceleration must show damped oscillations from an initial
value to zero, damping factors measured on time histories are assumed as evaluating
factors of these transient motions.

Side wind sensitivity tests for cars (ISO 12021) and for industrial vehicles (ISO
14793) are also available; for these vehicles speciﬁc tests can be used to examine the
effect of trailers.

All the elementary maneuvers we have considered, although very complicated,
do not correspond to real driver behavior; they are, nevertheless, very useful for
understanding the natural vehicle response before any correction by the driver has
been applied.

The opinion of the people that have designed these tests is that the ﬁrst part
of any real maneuver is always of the open-loop type; in fact, drivers apply an

50

18 Vehicle Functions

action on controls (steering wheel, accelerator and pedal brake) whose amplitude
is suggested by the desired response; the amplitude has been learned on previous
similar maneuvers.

After a short while corrections are applied, as soon as some deviation from expec-
tation has been perceived. The simpler the correction, the lower the deviation from
the desired response.

A simple closed-loop maneuver introduces difﬁculties in evaluation, as it depends

on the different behavior or ability of different drivers.

The lane change maneuver (ISO 3888) studies vehicle stability by overtaking
another vehicle or avoiding an obstacle; the relative course is shown in Fig. 18.1 and
is driven from the left to the right.

The course is deﬁned by rubber posts; the ﬁrst stretch S1 is the normal driving
lane, the stretch S3 represents the overtaking lane and S5 again the normal driving
lane.

The three stretches are joined by the zones S2 and S3; the right border of the
overtaking lane is shifted by the deviation d to the left, with reference to the left
border of the normal driving lane. The scheme of the course should be designed as
follows (dimensions are in [m]).

Stretch S1
Stretch S2
Stretch S3
Stretch S4
Stretch S5
Deviation d

length 12 m, width l = 1.1 w + 0.25
length 13.5 m
length 11 m, width l = w + 1
length 12.5 m
length 12 m, width l = 1.3 w + 0.25

1 m

Dimension w is the vehicle width, measured in [m] without taking into account

side mirrors; the width of stretch S3 cannot be less than 3 m.

This elementary maneuver is of the closed-loop type, because driver course cor-

rections are essential to avoid hitting any rubber post.

18.2 Objective Requirements

51

The car must be driven at 90 km/h in IVth gear and car speed should remain
unchanged along the course; varying parameters may be used to compare different
vehicles.

The maneuver is complicated and heavily inﬂuenced by driver skills; with pro-
fessional drivers, interesting results can be gathered more by subjective impressions
than objective measurements.

In order to assess vehicle stability while avoiding a sudden obstacle, the vehicle
is tested many times on this course at increasing speeds; the vehicle enters stretch S1
at the initial steady state speed, at which point the accelerator pedal is fully released
to simulate obstacle detection. After repeated tests, the maximum obtained speed
achieved without hitting any post may be taken as an objective evaluation of vehicle
stability.

As far as the braking performance is concerned, the easiest repeatable test is to
measure the stopping distance of the vehicle at maximum possible acceleration; if
the ABS device is missing this test can identify the maximum possible deceleration
without blocking any rear wheel.

It is useful to repeat this test on tracks with different levels of friction and with
different vehicle load conditions; on low friction roads (for instance on icy roads)
it is also a good practice to measure the vehicle path with different friction on the
two sides of the vehicle (μ split). This maneuver, useful in evaluating ABS systems,
simulates braking on a road with a wet or icy border.

The catalogue of maneuvers is not complete; many other tests are used to focus

on speciﬁc problems.

18.2.3 Dynamic Comfort

Comfort is correlated to passenger unease caused by vibrations between 1 and 100 Hz
in frequency; higher frequency vibrations correlate solely with purely acoustic dis-
comfort.

Vibrations in this range are caused by obstacles and hollows on the road surface,
which are ﬁltered by the elastic and damping properties of tires, suspensions and
seats; these condition the inﬂuence of powertrain mass vibrations (caused by the
road) and vibrations of the body, which enhance or reduce the effect of the road,
according to their vibration modes.

Comfort tests are performed on closed tracks that reproduce the road surfaces the
vehicle is most likely to encounter; the road must be maintained according to speciﬁc
standards to allow repeatable results on these tests.

Ambient temperature must also be controlled and recorded because of its inﬂuence
on the elastic and damping properties of elastomers, which are largely employed in the
mechanical components connecting the ground proﬁle with passengers; temperature
also has a remarkable inﬂuence on oil viscosity of shock absorbers.

Measurements to be evaluated include the acceleration of the different parts
in contact with the human body, such as ﬂoor, seat, steering wheel, etc.; other

52

18 Vehicle Functions

accelerometers could be set at different positions in the mechanical chain, to monitor
test accuracy and for diagnostic purposes.

It should be noticed that accelerations should be measured along the three main
axes of the vehicle reference system, especially if the more important components
are along the z and x axis. Vehicle speed measurement is also important, because it
and the road proﬁle validate the test.

Four proﬁles exist for elementary tests that replicate the most common road

defects.

A motorway proﬁle with perfect tarmac is characterized by a virtually ﬂat surface,
with peaks and hollows much further apart than the vehicle wheelbase; at speeds of
100–120 km/h, this spacing may excite the natural vertical frequency of the power-
train and of the vehicle suspension. This kind of course is also used to identify and
analyze vibrations coming from the shape of the tires and any defects in them.

A suburban road with poor maintenance is characterized by hollows that are
spaced closer than vehicle wheelbase, with different size pits, patches and ruptures
of the wear layer; Fig. 18.2, at the left supplies an example of these defects.

These kinds of defects involve a range of frequencies larger than the previous and
excite the natural vibration modes of sprung and unsprung masses: comfort in this
test is critical for customer satisfaction since these defects are widespread.

The stone block pavement (Fig. 18.2, at right) is still common in city centers
because of its attractive appearance and relative immunity to ice damage; it is there-
fore a reference test for the urban environment and is associated with lower speeds
than the previous tests.

Because of the nature of this surface the wave length spectrum is very wide,
from a few centimeters to several meters. The consequent excitation encompasses
the entire range of comfort frequencies, involving all suspension components and
car structures.

The catalogue of comfort tests includes, usually, a single step obstacle, represent-
ing what happens when crossing a curb or a railway; this obstacle is represented
by a steel bar of rectangular section across a ﬂat tarmac road. This kind of obstacle

Fig. 18.2 Typical defects of suburban and urban roads, relevant to vehicle comfort; at left a patched
tarmac; at right a stone block pavement

18.2 Objective Requirements

53

generates a force pulse on the wheels and involves a wide range of frequencies, with
vibrations along the z and x axis.

18.2.4 Ergonomics

Ergonomic functions involving the chassis are inﬂuenced by the position of controls
and by the force required for their operation; the main controls include the steering
wheel, brake and clutch pedals, gear shift stick and parking brake.

The current trend of widening the passenger compartment as much as possible

makes the pedal board the starting point of preliminary studies of car habitability.

Installed into the passenger compartment, the pedal board is constrained by the

following elements:
• front wheel well: its dimensions are determined by the front wheel steering enve-
lope and by the suspension stroke; this volume should also take snow chains into
account;

• ﬂoor tunnel, for the transmission shaft on rear wheel driven cars and for the exhaust

pipe in front wheel driven cars;

• minimum clearance from the ground;
• ﬁrewall, separating the passenger compartment from the engine, which is also used

to attach the pedal board.

The most forward position possible for the pedal board is desired to increase the
available space for driver and passengers. The limit to the front position is represented
by the powertrain and by the steering box. The ﬂoor tunnel, from one side, and the
wheel well, from the other side, limit lateral space for positioning the pedal board.
These limits are especially critical on narrow cars.

The accelerator pedal is always in contact with the right foot of the driver, except
when braking. It must be operated with minimal force and high precision: the foot
requires a side rest to avoid interference from vertical vibrations.
The accelerator pedal stroke should be about 50–60 mm.
The reference point for positioning the accelerator pedal is the most rearward
position of the driver’s foot when resting on the ﬂoor, according to the projected
comfort angles. It is called the heel point.

To avoid excess contact between shoe and pedal, the relative motions of these two

parts should be minimized.

Because of pedal motion, the shoe sole changes direction. Since the hinge point
of the pedal is ﬁxed, this condition of no slip between pedal and shoe can be obtained
only in one position; it is preferred that this position be the one most frequently used,
usually at mid-stroke. The slip can be reduced in the other positions by curving the
pedal.

The brake pedal can be operated by relevant forces and stroke precision is not

very important.

54

18 Vehicle Functions

According to regulatory standards, the control force must not be higher than
500 N, but it is suggested that this control be designed to limit the maximum pedal
force below 200–250 N, using the power assistance system.

To exert control forces easily, it is assumed that the driver’s foot is angled on the

ﬂoor to reduce the torque on the heel.

This kind of operation is allowed for emergency braking only, while for ordinary

braking, the pedal is depressed in the same way as the accelerator.

The clutch pedal can also be operated in two ways, according to design choices

and driver’s habits:
• with the heel on the ﬂoor;
• with the foot at a higher position for the ﬁrst part of the pedal stroke, and resting

on the ﬂoor at the end of the stroke (clutch fully disengaged).

The ﬁrst mode is used for precision modulation, as for starting up on a grade. In

this phase the pedal stroke is limited.

Because the force on the pedal should stay below 100 N, the foot position could

be advanced without negative consequences on heel torque.

On the most common pedal boards, the hinge axis of the accelerator and brake
pedal are different, while they are the same for clutch and brake pedals. To allow
different strokes for the last two pedals the clutch pedal in rest position can be placed
higher.

To avoid interference with other pedals when depressing a pedal quickly, the
distance between pedal centers should be as high as the sole width, not less than
100 mm.

Steering wheel positioning is more complex and must take into account:

• a minimum relative distance from the pedal board to allow correct operation of
the pedals; this implies a minimum distance of about 650 mm between the highest
pedal, in rest position, and the lower surface of the steering wheel;
• a comfortable inclination for the steering wheel of about 30◦–35◦;
• a rotation axis placed at least 300 mm from the middle of the vehicle, to avoid

interference with the front passenger during steering;

• interference with the driver’s leg while entering and exiting the car.

All decisions on control positions should be taken at the same time the body is

outlined. Because of this, such decisions are rarely made by chassis designers.

A relevant indicator of steering wheel ergonomics is the force needed to turn the

steering wheel at low speed.

This evaluation should be made by executing steering cycles, at low car speed
(about 5–7 km/h), from stop to stop; steering wheel rotation speed should be between
100 and 150 ◦/s.

The output of this test reveals the hysteresis cycle of the steering wheel, as

explained in the ﬁrst volume, in the section on power steering.

When electric by-wire transmissions have totally replaced mechanical controls,
there will be much more freedom to position these controls than was possible earlier.

18.2 Objective Requirements

55

Major future developments include the possibilities of:

• using joy-sticks or other devices, instead of the traditional steering wheel;
• integrating other functions such as shift, brake and clutch control in the steering

control;

• mounting the steering control on moving boards, to enhance vehicle accessibility

and to allow driving from either side;

• personalizing controls depending on user needs, to allow disabled people, for

example, to drive more easily.

Other information about controls is reported in the ﬁrst volume.

18.3 Subjective Requirements

Vehicle testing by car manufacturers is not only the ﬁnal veriﬁcation of product
competitiveness before the launch, but also a valuable instrument for establishing
measurable system objectives.

Classic testing implies objective experiments that are deﬁned by straightforward
procedures that are not affected by the skill or the personality of the driver, and
that lead to precise and repeatable results, allowing the immediate comparison of
achieved with target values. This testing is by nature objective.

The limitation of this approach is that the correlation between these measurements

and customer expectation is small.

Customer opinions are subjective, based upon an evaluation of the difference
between what they actually obtain in a given car and what they think is a reasonable
expectation; an acceptable result is conditioned by their experience with previous
cars and what they learn from specialized magazines, discussions with others and
advertisements.

Tests to evaluate these judgements are called subjective tests and do not require
particular instruments or dedicated test facilities, because they simply reﬂect the
customers’ day by day experience.

Some functions, to be interpreted, are simple such as dynamic performance; oth-

ers, such as handling performance, are more complex.

The evaluation of dynamic performance consists of measuring variables (top
speed, acceleration, pick-up, etc.), which, according to their type, satisfy the cus-
tomer as their value is low or high. Nevertheless, it is very difﬁcult to identify the
correct value for each variable or to establish if a lower value in a particular variable
(for instance, acceleration) can be tolerated, if it produces a better result in some
other variable (for instance, fuel consumption).

The difﬁculty will be even greater if the optimum value for the understeering
index of a new car has to be balanced against performance in the accelerator pedal
release maneuver.

A simple way to overcome this difﬁculty is to perform jury tests, using potential
costumers of the car under development; a jury test is a typically subjective test where

56

18 Vehicle Functions

subjective customer judgements on a homogenous cluster of cars are acquired and
elaborated through the use of statistical methods. In this cluster of homogenous cars
a prototype, representing the car under development, may also be included.

The proper execution of a jury test execution requires that cars to be evaluated are
already built and have reached a satisfactory level of reﬁnement. They would not be
of use in the early stages of development as technical speciﬁcations are deﬁned.

More often, jury tests and the analysis of their results are part of initiatives that
are independent of the development of a speciﬁc product; they can be performed
occasionally, to evaluate the development of competitors’ products and consequent
customer expectations. A test campaign like this can establish customer evaluation
criteria and target values.

To develop technical speciﬁcations for a new car, a vehicle mathematical model

will be applied that has been previously validated with experimental results.

Mathematical models will be used to assign to the components of the new vehicle
technical speciﬁcations that match the results to be achieved in a virtual jury test,
one that will be performed as soon as signiﬁcant prototypes are available. Instead of
potential customers, professional drivers from the company will be used, who will
use the same evaluation methods as the customers in previous jury tests.

We will consider three examples, applied respectively to handling, to dynamic
comfort and to fuel consumption; other requirements can be studied in a similar way.

18.3.1 Handling and Active Safety

In this section we will describe the approach that has been developed in many articles
quoted in the references.

Manufacturers usually evaluate handling and active safety by using professional
drivers, who are able to make comparisons, correct errors, and address chassis design-
ers; the point is to correlate these judgements with subjective tests performed by
potential costumers. These are eventually replicated with mathematical models to
produce useful design tools.

In our references, dynamic behavior requirements are classiﬁed according to the

scheme in Fig. 18.3.

The scheme suggests a classiﬁcation that takes into account driving conditions
involving lateral dynamics (driving in a curve), longitudinal dynamics (accelerating
and braking) and the interaction between the two situations (braking and accelerating
in a curve).

Driving conditions are classiﬁed as to driving ease or safety, as in emergency
maneuvers; non-professional drivers are able to evaluate maneuvers of the ﬁrst kind,
while only professional drivers are asked to judge the second kind.

For each driving condition it is important to be able to distinguish between vehicle
response and control quality; for instance, power assistance is relevant to steering
control quality, but not relevant for vehicle dynamic response.

In terms of lateral dynamics, steering activity is considered the quantity of work
to be applied to this control (steering wheel) to obtain a certain result; response

18.3 Subjective Requirements

57

Fig. 18.3 Fundamental requirements of longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, which deﬁne
handling and active safety

speed and response progressiveness1 as proportional to the effects of the action on
the command are also relevant. Roll angle and roll speed are also relevant for comfort
and stability.

Viewing lateral dynamics in terms of control quality, again for lateral dynamics,
self-alignment represents the ability of the vehicle to drive spontaneously on a straight
line, while center play is relevant in evaluating the command insensitivity to small
steering angles on a straight course.

Response and reaction graduality2 are relevant to completing the judgement of

steering wheel quality.

For the sake of brevity, we do not comment on requirements related to the inter-

action of longitudinal and lateral dynamics.

The sample of cars to be examined is ﬁnalized according to the result we want
to obtain from this study; in the case we are summarizing, the sample is ample, in
terms of car types (they were selected in different market segments), because this
study is focused on the correlation between the subjective judgements of drivers and
objective measures to be acquired during selected elementary standard maneuvers.
As the correlation is demonstrated, the sample can be limited to existing cars that

are more similar to the new product under development.

1 We can deﬁne progressiveness of a control as the derivative of its output (i.e., braking force), with
reference to its input (i.e., brake pedal force).
2 We can deﬁne graduality of a control as the derivative of the force or torque applied with reference
to its stroke.

58

18 Vehicle Functions

The test jury must include professional and non-professional drivers, in order to
evaluate both emergency and normal driving conditions and also to ﬁnd out if there
is any systematic bias between the two categories; the size of the sample (at least 20
people) must be chosen to allow a sufﬁcient conﬁdence level.

All cars are evaluated in free driving conditions, on a test track offering the neces-
sary safety and a course suitable for highlighting all requirements under evaluation.
A questionnaire must be set up, to gather test results; its questions address the
requirements under consideration and must include numeric scores; an overall verdict
is also required.

All scores are subjected to statistical techniques to:

• eliminate scoring bias; many jurors use only a part of the scoring scale, assigning

scores that deviate constantly from the average;

• eliminate those scores that are too removed from the average of the jury.

After this treatment, the correlation between single values and overall judgment

is investigated, using a multiple regression analysis.

Figure 18.4 shows the result of this analysis; all scores are normalized on a decimal

scale. Histogram f refers to the overall judgement.

The same cars were evaluated on open-loop elementary maneuvers that were felt

to be more ﬁnalized to the requirements under evaluation.
The following elementary maneuvers were applied.

• Steering pad, according to the ISO 4138 standard, on a curvature 40 m in radius,

starting from a low speed up to the maximum safe speed.

• Lateral transient test, according to the ISO 7401 standard, followed by the steering
wheel release maneuver (ISO 17288). Cars were driven at 100 km/h on a straight
path and received a steering input to the desired value at steering angular speed of
at least 200 ◦/s−1; this value was maintained for 3 s and the steering wheel released
for another 3 s. The accelerator pedal was kept in place during the maneuvers. The
test was repeated for incremental steering wheel values, until a value was identiﬁed
at which the vehicle does not stabilize.

• Overtaking test according to ISO 3888 standards, at 90 km/h; although this maneu-
ver is a closed-loop and was not created for objective evaluation, an objective
measurement has been obtained by dividing the square average of vehicle lateral
acceleration by the steering work. Delays between acceleration and steering wheel
peaks have also been measured.

There is no direct correlation between a single subjective judgement and a single
elementary objective maneuver; nevertheless, the multiple regression analysis relat-
ing each subjective judgement to all objective measurements under consideration
returns an overall correlation factor of more than 0.85.

The correlation linear equations allow us to deﬁne partial driving quality indices,
which correlate objective measurements, measured or calculated on elementary
maneuvers, with subjective evaluations and, therefore, with customer satisfaction.

The global driving quality index in Fig. 18.4f is correlated to other indices with
the same method and allows us to evaluate a priori the possible trade-off between
these indices.

A similar process can be repeated for other groups of variables in Fig. 18.4, deﬁn-
ing a global index that allows us to apply measurements to elementary maneuvers to
forecast the customer’s judgement on a car in terms of handling and active safety.

18.3.2 Dynamic Comfort

This logical process has been also applied to the case of dynamic comfort; although
this work considers acoustic and vibration comfort as a whole, we will limit our
analysis to vibrations only.

In this study drivers have driven their cars on open roads as they wish; the chosen
road has been classiﬁed according to recorded acceleration on selected car positions.

The questionnaire was divided into three different parts.
The ﬁrst one was addressed to vibrations perceived on different contact points

with test cars:
• body ﬂoor;
• seat cushion;
• seat back rest;
• steering wheel.

60

18 Vehicle Functions

The second part of this questionnaire solicited reactions to different perceived
disturbances in the main movement of the vehicle; a follow-up variance analysis has
suggested that these results not be considered because of their excessive spread.

The third part was designed to gather an overall judgement; the scoring scale was
again decimal, with scores of 10 assigned as the absolute optimum (no disturbances
perceived).

Data on subjective measurements have not beneﬁtted from standard elementary
maneuvers, as in the case of handling; in their absence the following maneuvers have
been used:
• random inputs on the motorway at 80, 100, 120, 140 km/h; on urban stone pave-
ment, at 20, 40, 60 km/h; and on a low maintenance suburban road, at 20, 40,
60 km/h.

• shocks from a rectangular proﬁle single obstacle across the road, at 30 and 50 km/h;
on a rail level crossing at 20 and 40 km/h; and crossing a bump at 30 and 50 km/h;
each obstacle has been reproduced on a track, by proﬁles achieved on open roads.

Acceleration measurements from random tests have been achieved by calculating
R M S in the domain of time and frequency. The same procedure has been applied to
the shock test, including calculated magnitudes as, for instance, wasted energy, as
well.

In this case, partial indices and a global index can be obtained that are well
correlated to overall customer judgement and to the single measurements derived by
elementary maneuvers.

18.3.3 Fuel Consumption

Contrary to the previously described requirements, where customers have difﬁculty in
formulating objective judgments about their satisfaction, fuel consumption is mea-
sured and recorded objectively by many customers. Even if this measurement is,
sometimes, acquired without scientiﬁc methods, there is no doubt that these judge-
ments about the car are more reliable than others.

The most difﬁcult information to be obtained about fuel consumption is the effec-

tive driving conditions used by customers in evaluating it.

It is standard practice to include questions about fuel consumption on all ques-
tionnaires that car manufacturers send to their customer sample, to have feedback on
their products after a short period of use.

According to a European Union law we will discuss in the next chapter, fuel
consumption is measured on a roller bench on a simulated course reproducing urban,
suburban and motorway trafﬁc. Since this measure is the only allowed channel for
customer information about fuel consumption, this procedure has been chosen instead
of others to evaluate fuel consumption objectively.

This procedure is characteristically independent of vehicle performance and
driving habits and imposes on all cars the same gear shifting speeds; if this ﬁrst

18.3 Subjective Requirements

61

characteristic is justiﬁed by the high trafﬁc density on our roads, the second and
third have, as their justiﬁcation, the need to make the test procedure objective and
repeatable.

It is often the case that the results of this test, when compared with tests in actual

trafﬁc conditions, can suggest wrong judgements, when comparing different cars.

The interesting fact is that this result is not due to speciﬁc customer driving habits,
but represents a phenomenon that can be detected with statistical procedures on a
sample of homogeneous customers.

Similar criteria to those of previous examples have been applied to fuel consump-

tion. We describe a recent research on medium size non-sporty cars.

Identifying potential customers is essential to deﬁning the market for these cars.
The customer’s economic bracket inﬂuences the negative value assigned to high
fuel consumption; relevant parameters may be car price (a high-income customer is
less sensitive to fuel consumption than to comfort and consequent weight), yearly
distance travelled and type of car. On a sporty car, for instance, driving habits are
less mindful of consumption, while diesel cars are frequently driven by customers
sensitive to this parameter.

This test campaign included 20 non-professional drivers using a homogeneous
sample of recent cars. A driving mission was deﬁned, including an urban, a suburban
and a motorway section, representing real-world use of the car recorded over a
signiﬁcant period of time by each driver.

Departing from the standard driving cycle (correlation coefﬁcient 0.77), a high
correlation (correlation coefﬁcient 0.97) was detected on this driving course with
claimed fuel consumption, as previously determined by questionnaires to potential
costumers.

New driving schedules have been developed, to be performed on roller dynamome-

ters, that are representative of each mission and driving habit.

The following approach has been adopted:

• for each car and driver, the statistical distributions of average speed, engine idling
times, average positive and negative accelerations and average gear change speeds
have been recorded and investigated;

• by comparing time histograms of the different gear speeds with car speed and
acceleration, a map of gear shift speed has been obtained, as a function of longi-
tudinal acceleration and speed;

• speed time histories on each mission have been analyzed from start to stop, iden-

tifying any cluster where similar sequences have been grouped.

A new urban and suburban cycle has been identiﬁed; the important characteristic
of these new cycles is not relevant to car speeds which are slightly higher than
standard speeds, but it is remarkable that the speed shift criterion depends upon car
pick-up time; the higher the available torque exceeding driving resistance, the lower
the vehicle speed where the gear is upshifted.

It should be remembered that this ﬁrst conclusion is not applicable to all cars, but

is limited to the kind of car, customers and driving environment to be considered.

62

18 Vehicle Functions

Fig. 18.5 Comparison between upshift speeds for two cars of almost equal mass and displacement
in urban trafﬁc (above) and suburban trafﬁc (below), as a function of the requested longitudinal
acceleration ax , measured in [g]. The engine of the car shown in the diagram on the right is designed
to have its peak torque at higher engine revolutions

Figure 18.5 demonstrates our conclusion. On the two diagrams on the right, show-
ing the upshift speeds, measured in [km/h], as a function of the longitudinal requested
acceleration, measured in [g] a car with a peak torque at high engine speed is shown;
on the left diagrams the same car with peak torque at lower engine speed is shown.
The upper diagrams refer to urban driving, the lower to suburban driving.

The engine with higher elasticity induces drivers to lower upshift speeds for low
accelerations; since accelerations between 0.12–0.20 g are frequent in urban trafﬁc
and between 0.02–0.07 g are frequent in suburban trafﬁc, the more elastic engine is
used, on average, at lower rotational speeds, with higher gears.

Vehicle fuel consumption is strongly inﬂuenced by gear ratios; in general, we may
say that in the prevalent conditions of use, fuel consumption is almost proportional
to engine speed.

If in theory the availability of higher transmission ratios favours reduced fuel
consumption in a standard cycle, the conclusion of this work suggests that these
reductions will not be achieved if the reduced pick-up capacity of the car stimulates
drivers to use lower ratios more frequently.

Motorway consumption in this test campaign was sufﬁciently correlated with the

traditional test procedure; under these conditions, the highest ratios were used.

Measured driving distances were equally divided over the three driving environ-

ments.

18.4 Aging Resistance

18.4 Aging Resistance

63

A car’s endurance, or resistance to age, is a function that can be evaluated objectively
by driving it for a speciﬁed distance without damage.

We must clarify what we mean by damage; during the life of a car, customers ask
not only for few failures, but little deterioration of those parameters found in a new
car.

In the case of the automotive chassis, we mean also that requirements about:

• dynamic performance,
• handling and active safety,
• dynamic comfort,
• ergonomics,

can deteriorate only within an acceptable range of tolerance; in addition, nothing that
can affect vehicle availability (to perform its function), can occur except through the
fulﬁllment of scheduled maintenance.

Failure includes, therefore, not only breakdowns of mechanical or electric parts,
but also noise not detectable on a new vehicle, lubricant leakages, aesthetic corrosion,
changes in dynamic behavior, fuel consumption, freedom of movement on controls,
etc.

It is hard to forecast how the vehicle will be used, because use is conditioned by
the life and driving style of the customer; in addition, applied loads can be determined
by unforeseeable events.

Therefore, endurance speciﬁcations are assigned statistically often using the
parameter B10, which deﬁnes the endurance achieved without any failure by 10% of
the population of vehicles produced.

As a reference for the value of this parameter, we can assume as adequate for

today’s production, about:
• B10 (cid:2) 200,000 km, for cars and commercial vehicles;
• B10 (cid:2) 400,000 km, for buses;
• B10 (cid:2) 800,000 km, for heavy duty trucks.

As technology and the market are evolving continuously, it is possible that these

values will increase in the future.

These travelling distances make it almost impossible to perform, in the standard
delay time of 3–4 years on the average devoted to a new vehicle development, the
tests needed to assess endurance experimentally, after design and prototype manu-
facturing, with a sufﬁcient conﬁdence level; nor can this job be reasonably assigned
to mathematical models.

In the case of cars, a life of about 200,000 km implies, on average, 4,000 h of
driving time, assuming standard driving tasks; if we allocate six months for this
task, as usually occurs, then to perform two complete sets of tests on two different
prototype generations (where the second carries corrections for the ﬁrst), the test
time must be shortened by at least 3–4 times.

64

18 Vehicle Functions

Phenomena that can inﬂuence the endurance of a vehicle can be classiﬁed accord-

ing to the following categories:
• fatigue;
• wear;
• corrosion;
• shocks and collisions.

sources: tires and engine.

External fatigue loads that can stress chassis components arise from two different

Tires apply to the chassis, longitudinal, lateral and vertical forces, changing over
time; the ﬁrst and second act with the frequency (on average low) of acceleration,
braking and cornering events along the path of the vehicle; the last act with the higher
frequencies given by the shape and spatial density of obstacles overcome.

The engine stresses the chassis at usually low frequencies, determined by the
schedule of maneuvers (acceleration, releases, shifts) and at higher frequencies deter-
mined by its reciprocating parts.

Other periodic forces may be added when some of the above is working near the
natural frequencies of the structures to which it is applied; this is particularly relevant
for chassis structures and transmission.

Subject to fatigue are suspension and steering arms, wheels, bearings, springs,
some braking parts (calipers, controls), transmission shafts, gears and chassis struc-
tures.

Most of these parts are made out of metals whose resistance can be described
according to Wöhler’s model; there is a threshold of load amplitude (fatigue limit)
for these materials which can be applied indeﬁnitely without any damage.

For this category of parts, test times can be reduced by applying techniques that
remove the periods of load history below the fatigue limit. This can be done precisely
by analyzing load time histories that will be applied to bench tests or by driving cars
in more strenuous tests that apply loads that damage structures more severely.

Using this last approach the driving distance of a car’s life can be condensed into

about 50,000 km of heavy use.

Wear is determined by the friction of parts in relative motion; on the chassis, wear
applies mainly to transmissions (bushings, rotary and sliding seals, synchro mesh
and gears) and partly to suspensions.

Wear, the removal of material on sliding parts, depends on wasted friction, accord-
ing to the hypothesis proposed by Theodor Reye about 140 years ago. Wear can
therefore be accelerated by increasing loads, with attention to temperatures, that can
affect the mechanical properties of materials.

A wear test for components can be reliably performed on test benches, where

contact conditions are made more severe according to empirical procedures.

Corrosion is caused by the chemical action of many agents (humidity, salts, other
chemical compounds and aerosols) on parts exposed to the atmosphere or splashed
by the wheels; since this action is not constant throughout the life of the car, the test
can be accelerated by exposing entire cars or components to corrosive humidostatic
rooms for a certain period.

18.4 Aging Resistance

65

Another method, as effective as the ﬁrst, is to drive through acid water pools

during a certain portion of the fatigue course.

As we have seen, wear and corrosion test acceleration is totally empirical and is

deﬁned according to the manufacturer’s experience.

Vehicle resistance to shocks and collisions must be examined through artiﬁcially

reproduced events.

This applies to crash tests against barriers, requested by regulations, where chassis

components must not interfere with occupants as a consequence of the collision.

There are also non-regulated shocks, where it is good practice to verify that there
are no critical situations for occupants; one example of this category is the accidental
collision of wheel against sidewalk, as a consequence of a mistaken maneuver; it is
obvious that in these cases chassis structural integrity is not requested.

The designer must guarantee that there are no partial or hidden ruptures unde-
tectable by the driver. Linkages and suspension arms must feature a rupture load
at least 50% higher than the collapse load, where deformations become permanent;
deformations, prior to rupture, must alter suspension geometry in such a way as to
be easily noticeable by drivers, in order to suggest trip interruption.

Vehicle life is simulated by separate tests reproducing speciﬁc situations; fatigue
tests are more difﬁcult because they are determined not only by their duration but
also by conditions of vehicle use.

Each manufacturer has decided to design vehicles for the most demanding con-
ditions, accepting high safety margins for ordinary use; loop courses have been
developed that are characterized by many bends, bumpy and uneven stretches (arti-
ﬁcially damaged tarmac, stone pavement, dirty road, etc.) and rail crossings; a part
of these courses is dedicated to water-crossing.

Such loops, if driven at high speed, can concentrate 200,000 km of real life into
about 50,000 km, driven in about 1,000 h; this time corresponds to about two months,
assuming three driving shifts on the same car, and including test interruptions to
maintain and inspect the test prototype.

Load conditions to be considered in mathematical models or applied to test

benches are also derived from this kind of loop.

A common test loop includes straight stretches long enough to allow the car to
reach the highest acceleration and deceleration conditions; curves are driven at the
slip limit.

Loop length is not relevant, because it will be repeated in both driving directions so
as not to stress the vehicle in a selective way, until the total driving distance is reached;
loop length is conditioned by the need to apply all tests suitable for simulating the
most demanding driving situations. Usually these loops are between 20 and 30 km
in length.

Pavement must offer a high friction coefﬁcient to stress suspensions and chassis
as much as possible. Sometimes, on long straight stretches, signals can be used to
request additional maneuvers (decelerations, accelerations, slaloms).

Figure 18.6 shows a record of the main force components acting on a medium

size car on a loop of this kind.

66

18 Vehicle Functions

Fig. 18.6 Records of suspension strokes, showing longitudinal and lateral loads on rear suspensions
of a medium size car, driven on a fatigue loop clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW)

Instead of vertical forces, suspension strokes have been measured; vertical forces
may be calculated from suspension characteristics. Brake torque has also been added
to separate transmission effects from those of the brakes in longitudinal forces.

These records originate from test bench load conditions, after mathematical elab-
oration; the same conditions can be applied to ﬁnite elements analyses, which are
usually integrated into multibody models to simulate the entire vehicle.

Reorganization of the test cycles can be performed according to the rain ﬂow
method; the result is a set of load histograms, shown in Figs. 18.7, 18.8, and 18.9, rep-
resenting suspension stroke as well as longitudinal and lateral accelerations. Accel-
erations are derived by forces with reference to the sprung mass and can be applied
to different cars as well, as a ﬁrst approximation.

These histograms deﬁne the so-called load blocks which correspond to driving
the entire loop, about 30 km long, once clockwise and once counterclockwise; the
load block is applied about 2,000 times to simulate the entire vehicle life.

It should be noted that accelerations refer to sprung mass; acceleration values
apparently inconsistent with practical friction coefﬁcients are not surprising, because
vertical loads are increased by transfers due to lateral accelerations.

Figure 18.10 shows a bench for fatigue tests of a car body, complete in its main
chassis components; actuators for applying loads and torques are also shown. The
front wheel can be stressed similarly.

Dynamic analysis of these forces assumes a particular importance if we want to
determine fatigue load for particular components under speciﬁed driving conditions.

Usually the entire vehicle simulation applies multibody modeling techniques that
are useful when displacement is relevant; these models allow not only displacement
but also forces exchanged in any part of the system to be calculated.

In multibody modeling, system elements are considered as rigid bodies connected
by elastic or viscoelastic couplings. In some cases, it is necessary, for a more precise
determination of acting loads, to also take into account the ﬂexibility of some part,
such as the car body or the twist beam of a rear suspension.

Craig-Bampton’s theory allows the ﬂexibility of speciﬁc vehicle structures by their
modal synthesis to be taken into account; this can be obtained by a ﬁnite element
calculation of the modal deformations.

In practice, for a speciﬁc structure:

• the displacements of the structure, compatible with its degrees of freedom, are

evaluated as the result of an applied unitary force;

• the vibration modes are calculated, in a range up to about 100 Hz.

These data are applied to the multibody model, to determine the internal forces

exchanged between the different components.

A multibody model of the vehicle system should include at least:

• the car body, as rigid body or as ﬂexible body, according to the scenario under

study;

• the powertrain mass and its suspension;
• the complete front and rear suspensions;
• tires, when loads are calculated from an open-loop maneuver of interest.

The different parts are connected by joints, showing a suitable elastic and vis-
coelastic characteristic; mass and inertia properties are calculated for each of them.
If we refer to the previously described scenario, the same input for the test bench

of Fig. 18.10 can be adopted as input to the multibody model.

The output of this analysis should be the forces that are exchanged at the articu-

lation point of the suspension to the car body.

These forces may be applied to ﬁnite element models addressed to calculate the
stress histories of the component under study, to determine the fatigue life of this
element.

This calculation can be performed in two different ways, due to the fact that there
is some overlap between force frequencies and natural frequencies of the component
under investigation.

If there is no overlap, forces can be applied quasi-statically. A stress time history

can be easily obtained by linear combination of the different effects.

If there is some overlap, dynamic modal techniques must be applied.

Chapter 19
Regulations

The aim of the European Union’s policy in the automotive sector is to legislate the
internal market for vehicles and ensure a high level of environmental protection and
safety, to strengthen competitiveness, and to provide a stable playing ﬁeld for the
industry. The technical harmonisation of motor vehicles allows car manufacturers to
access as large of a market as possible.

Harmonisation in the EU is based on the Whole Vehicle Type Approval System

(WVTA) and enables manufacturers to beneﬁt from the EU Single Market.

In addition, worldwide technical harmonisation under the United Nations Eco-

nomic Commission for Europe (UNECE) offers easy access to global markets.

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) was set up in
1947 and is one of ﬁve regional commissions of the United Nations. The others are
the:
• Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),
• Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Paciﬁc (ESCAP),
• Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC),
• Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).

UNECE’s major aim is to promote pan-European economic integration. UNECE
includes 56 member States in Europe, North America and Asia. However, all inter-
ested United Nations member States may participate in the work of UNECE. Over 70
international professional organizations and other non-governmental organizations
take part in UNECE activities.

By a Council Decision (N◦ 836 of 1997), the European Union entered an agree-
ment with UNECE concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions
for vehicles, equipment and parts and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of
approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions.

Consequently, many UNECE Regulations and their amendments are incorporated

within the EU type-approval procedure.

The Whole Vehicle Type Approval System (WVTA) describes the process applied
by European national authorities to certify that a model of a vehicle meets all EU
rules before authorising it to be placed on the EU market.

The manufacturer makes available about a dozen or more pre-production cars
that are equal to the ﬁnal product. These prototypes are used to test compliance with
EU rules concerning safety (regarding installation of lights, braking performance,
stability control, crash tests with dummies), noise and emissions limits as well as
production requirements of individual parts and components, such as seats, airbags,
etc. If all relevant requirements are met, the national authority delivers an EU WVTA
to the manufacturer authorising the sale of the vehicle type in the EU. The system
is based on the mutual recognition of approvals granted by Member States (certiﬁed
once, accepted everywhere in the EU).

Every vehicle produced is then accompanied by a certiﬁcate of conformity, which
is like the car’s birth certiﬁcate, in which the manufacturer certiﬁes that the vehicle
corresponds to WVTA. On the basis of this document, the vehicle can be registered
anywhere in Europe.

The manufacturer may make an application for WVTA in any EU Member State.
In most Member States the national Type Approval Authority (TAA) does not have in-
house testing facilities, so it designates a technical service allowed to test prototypes
on its behalf. In this case the TAA is responsible to check that the tests are done
correctly and the testing facilities in use are reliable. The manufacturer can get partial
type approvals in the different Member States but only one national authority will
always deliver the WVTA.

The approval of a vehicle type in one EU country is valid EU-wide without the
need for further tests and re-certiﬁcation. This principle of mutual recognition of
type approvals is at the core of the EU Single Market, but it requires strict rules and
thorough enforcement.

The EU sets the regulatory framework for type approval of vehicles. But within
the current type approval framework, national authorities are solely responsible for
checking car manufacturers’ compliance. National authorities do the policing on
the ground; the type approval authorities perform the checks before the product is
put on the market, while the market surveillance authorities are responsible for the
products that are already on the market. Those national authorities dispose of all the
enforcement tools necessary to implement EU legislation.

The type approval requirements are relevant to part of the vehicle functions we

have already introduced in previous chapters, particularly for:

• outside visibility;
• minimum dynamic performance necessary to grant a safe drive;
• occupant protection in case of collision;
• reduction of the environmental load caused by vehicle trafﬁc, with particular ref-
erence to polluting gases, carbon dioxide, outside noise and waste produced by
disposal of older vehicles.

The type approval requirements are formally issued by each national government;
in the past, some laws have also been developed by international institutions to
enhance the free movement and sale of vehicles in countries other than that of their
origin.

19 Regulations

73

The European Community faced in the 1960s the problem of harmonization of
national laws, to remove any impediment to the free circulation of goods within the
Community and to grant the citizens of member states the availability to buy state
of the art vehicles; this job has recently been carried over and completed by the
European Union.

The European Union behaves like a supranational body, requiring all member
states to develop laws complying with a common standard; these supranational laws
are called Directives and will be cited with the letter D, followed by a ﬁgure showing
the year of enactment and a following number. For instance the D 2007/46 directive
was the ﬁfty sixth law approved in 2007 and provides a framework for the approval
of motor vehicles and their related systems and components.

In a similar way UNECE Regulation will be cited by the set of letters UNECE R,
followed by the progressive number assigned in the UNECE Compendium of Legal
Instruments, Norms and Standards.

In parallel with Directives, Regulations have been also issued, summarizing in a
single document all approved test procedures relevant to given homologation func-
tions; these documents are quoted with the letter R, followed by a progressive number,
unique for each title, independent of any addition or modiﬁcation.

Since Directives must be established before national laws, they must be available in
advance of their enforcement time; in their formulation, they provide an enforcement
year for new homologations and one for new registrations.

No member state is allowed to prohibit sale, registration or circulation of any

vehicle complying with the Directives in force.

In this chapter we will consider Directives and Regulations impacting chassis

component design and vehicle system functions.

The following paragraphs will summarize laws regarding:

• vehicle system;
• tires;
• steering system;
• braking system;
• chassis structures.

The information presented here is only a short summary of the most important
applicable directives and regulations at the time of writing this book. It should be
considered as a reference only; we suggest that anyone requiring sure guidelines
look through the primary documents and check for new updates. This can be easily
done by visiting the Internet sites of the European Union dedicated to this purpose;
anyone can download excerpts of the Ofﬁcial Gazette.

The European Union situation should be considered a typical example of the
government approach to vehicle homologation; States outside of the Union could
have slightly different legislation, which must be carefully considered in the case the
vehicle is sold and registered in such countries.

19.1 Vehicle System

19.1.1 Whole Vehicle Type Approval

The D 2007/46 Directive deﬁnes the homologation procedure reported in summary
in the previous section; according to this Directive, the manufacturer is obliged to
submit an information form, reporting all vehicle characteristics that cannot be altered
without a new homologation.

The information form reports the following information regarding the issues we
are concerned with. The list is not complete; it should be considered only as a sample
of the contents of this Directive.

General Data

These consist of the manufacturer’s data, the position of the Vehicle Identiﬁcation
Number (VIN) identifying body, chassis and engine, and the vehicle category. The
following vehicle categories are identiﬁed:
• M1: vehicles for transporting people with fewer than eight seats, in addition to the

driver’s seat;

• M2: vehicles for transporting people with more than eight seats, in addition to the

driver’s seat and with a maximum overall mass of 5 t;
• M3: as above, but with an overall weight exceeding 5 t;
• N1: vehicles for transportation of goods with maximum weight exceeding 1 t, but

• N2: vehicles for transportation of goods with maximum weight exceeding 3.5 t,

lower than 3.5 t;

but lower than 12 t;

• N3: vehicles for transportation of goods with a maximum weight exceeding 12 t;
• O1: trailers with a maximum weight not exceeding 0.75 t;
• O2: trailers with a maximum weight exceeding 0.75 t, but lower than 3.5 t;
• O3: trailers with a maximum weight exceeding 3.5 t, but lower than 10 t;
• O4: trailers with a maximum weight exceeding 10 t.

19.1 Vehicle System

75

Also off-road vehicles are considered (symbol G) as modiﬁcations of the above
mentioned categories; for example vehicles of the categories M1 and N1 ar considered
to be off-road if they feature:

• at least one front and one rear driving axle, one of which can be disengaged by the

driver;

• at least one self-locking or locking differential;
• the gradeability of at least 30%, with no trailer;
• at least one of the following requirements:

1. angle of attack αa of, at least, 25◦;
2. angle of exit αu of, at least, 20◦;
3. ramp angle αr of, at least, 20◦;
4. ground clearance h2, under the front axle of, at least, 180 mm;
5. ground clearance h2, under the rear axle of, at least, 180 mm;
6. ground clearance between the axles h1 of, at least, 200 mm.

Figure 19.1 deﬁnes with the help of sketches the reported dimensions.
Front and rear attack angles measure the capacity of a vehicle to face sudden slope
changes in normal and reverse driving without any interference between chassis and
ground; the ramp angle, on the other hand, refers to a sudden slope change in both
directions.

attack angles αa and α p; αr
ramp angle; ground
clearance h1 and h2

76

19 Regulations

The ground clearance between axles is the maximum height of an ideal par-
allelepiped that can be inserted between the axles and under the chassis; ground
clearance under the axle refers to the lower point between the two contact points of
the wheels on the same axle.

Other geometrical prescriptions are assigned to other kinds of vehicles.

Vehicle Characteristics

These may consist of three pictures and a vehicle scheme showing the main dimen-
sions; the number of axles and wheels is reported, showing permanent or part-time
driving wheels. An outline scheme of the chassis frame, if any, should be included,
showing the material used for side beams.

Weights and Dimensions

Among the main dimensions, the wheelbase and interaxis (for vehicles of more than
two axles) must be reported under full weight conditions; for trailers, the distance
between the hook and ﬁrst axle pivot must be declared; for road tractors, the sad-
dle pivot longitudinal and elevation position must be referenced to the vehicle. All
dimensions are deﬁned by the ISO 586 standard. All tracks must also be declared.

The mass of the bare chassis frame (if any) must be declared, not including cabin,
ﬂuids, spare wheel, tools and driver; the weight breakdown on the axles must be also
declared.

Also the weight of the vehicle completed with body or cabin (depending on
the product sold by the manufacturer) and other items must be declared and its
breakdown on the axles; if the vehicle is a semi-trailer, the weight on the hook must
also be claimed.

Finally, maximum allowed weight has to be declared and its breakdown on axles

and hook (if any).

Transmission

Suspensions

Steering System

The transmission is described by a draft scheme, including data on its weight, archi-
tecture (single stage, double stage, continously variable, etc.), type of control (manual
or automatic), transmission ratios (gearbox and ﬁnal drives) and the vehicle speed
that can be obtained on the existing gears at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm.

Suspension schemes must be attached, including the damping and elastic character-
istics of shock absorbers and springs; allowed tire sizes must be declared.

A scheme of the steering mechanism and column must also be included; maximum
design forces on the steering wheel and maximum steering angles at the wheel and
the steering wheel must be declared. For these angles, the vehicle turning radii for
right and left turns must be declared.

19.1 Vehicle System

Brakes

77

As we will describe later, service, emergency and parking brakes must be fully
described.

The engine, body and other vehicle systems not included in the chassis must also

be described.

The WVTA certiﬁes the released homologation and reports for each of the char-

acteristics of the information form:

• the conformity of the presented prototypes to the described items;
• the conformity of those characteristics to legal requirements;
• the positive execution of tests;
• the existence of required drawings.

The same Directive establishes also procedures to be followed.
It is also established that each member State issuing homologation certiﬁcates
must arrange statistical control plans on operating vehicles, suitable to detect possible
non-compliance with the homologated prototypes; in case of non-conformity, the
issuing State must inform other States of the event and must organize the compulsory
recovery plan for the existing vehicles.

All applicable regulatory acts are also reported in Annex IV of this document as

well as all forms to be used for information and for the certiﬁcate of conformity.

19.1.2 Consumption and Emissions

R 2017/1151 reports the applicable rules of the European Union member States on
the emission of polluting gases from motor vehicles; this Directive also subsumes
the rules about fuel consumption measurement.

The outstanding point of this Regulation, consists in the deﬁnition of a transient
driving cycle, which is deﬁned to simulate vehicle usage in a real environment.
This cycle consists of a speed-time history to be assigned to every vehicle to be
homologated; it is related to high density trafﬁc, where overtaking or slowing down
is almost impossible.

The vehicle is tested on a dynamometer roller bench; a brake acting on the rollers
is able to replicate vehicle driving resistance faithfully. The same rollers drive, in
addition, a ﬂywheel battery; each ﬂywheel can be engaged or disengaged on the
brake: a suitable ﬂywheel combination can simulate vehicle inertia.

The test bench is provided by a CRT monitor showing the actual vehicle speed on
the bench, in combination with a band representing the driving cycle, with a tolerance
of ±2 km/h. The driver must follow this indicator, avoiding transient corrections that
could affect the consumption measurement.

Figure 19.2 shows the speed-time diagram of the urban cycle for emission and
consumption measurement as it was established initially by D 1970/220; this cycle

78

19 Regulations

Fig. 19.2 Speed-time diagram of the urban cycle for emissions and consumption measurement

Fig. 19.3 Speed-time diagram of the suburban driving cycle for emissions and fuel consumption
measurement

had to be followed four more times. We still report information about this driving
cycle because many existing data in the literature refer to it.

All gases emitted by the exhaust pipe during the test were collected in bags, whose
content was measured and analyzed after the test to determine HC, CO, NOx and
CO2 levels; weighted gases were divided by the ideally travelled distance on the
bench.

Later a second driving cycle of the suburban type was also established, to be

applied after the urban cycle. This cycle is reported in Fig. 19.3.

Table 19.1 shows a summary of the most important features of the two old driving

cycles.

The consumption was calculated by standard formulas, depending on the chemical
composition of the fuel (gasoline, diesel, LPG, natural gas), starting with the emission
value of CO2 measured in g/km.

This value was the only allowed statement from manufacturers to customers on
matters of fuel consumption; fuel consumption was also subject to conformity control
from the issuer of the homologation certiﬁcate.

The same cycles had to be used for electric energy consumption and range mea-

surement in electric vehicles.

This procedure proved to give too optimistic results as compared with those
obtained in the real life; for this reason the driving cycles, reported in R 2017/1151
now in force, were modiﬁed with more energy depending transients. The new pro-
cedure is called WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure).

The new test procedure provides a strict guidance regarding conditions of
dynamometer tests and road load (motion resistance), gear shifting, total car weight
(by including optional equipment, baggage and passengers), fuel quality, ambient
temperature, and tyre selection and pressure.

Three different WLTP test cycles (WLTC) are provided, depending on vehicle
class deﬁned by the ratio Pw of engine power to vehicle mass, measured in kW/t
(rated engine power devided by kerb mass):
• Class 1—vehicles with Pw (cid:2) 22 kW/t;
• Class 2—vehicles with 22 kW/t < Pw (cid:2) 34 kW/t;
• Class 3—vehicles with Pw > 34 kW/t.

Most existing cars have nowadays Pw ratios between 40 and 100 kW/t, to be

included in Class 3. Vans and buses are usually part of Class 2.

In each class, a different driving cycle is provided to represent real world vehicle
operation on urban and extra-urban roads, including motorways. The duration, the
acceleration and the speed are shaped differently to take into account the different
performance of each class of vehicles.

Since the wide variety of manual gearboxes with 4, 5, 6 and 7 gears makes it
impossible to specify ﬁxed gear shift points, the WLTP testing procedure provides
an algorithm for calculating optimal shift points, which takes into account the vehicle
weight and engine performance.

Limiting the information to Class 3 for sake of simplicity, the WLTC is composed
by four sections, called Low, Medium, High and Extra High sections, with reference

80

19 Regulations

to the top speed in the section; there are two different Medium and High sections,
depending from the top speed of the vehicle under test, if lower or higher than
120 km/h.

Again we present only the case of a top speed higher than 120 km/h, the most
frequent case. To obtain real data, check the Regulation that reports the driving
cycles in a table with speed in function of ellapsing time; we report only the time
diagram of the four sections, Low in Fig. 19.4, Medium in Fig. 19.5, High in Fig. 19.6
and Extra High in Fig. 19.7 for an easier comparison with the old driving cycle often
still referred in the literature.

In Table 19.2 a summary of characteristics of the WLTC for vehicles of Class 3

with top speed over 120 km/h is reported; it can be compared with the older one.

19.1.3 Recyclability

Each year about 12 million vehicles are scrapped in the European Union; they cor-
respond to about 0.5% of the total production.

D 2000/53 establishes rules to control waste products from these vehicles by

component and materials recycling.

These rules also address improvements to the environmental operations of com-

To prevent noxious waste formation, a set of laws has been introduced to limit the
use of some substances for vehicle and component manufacturers, making recycling
easier and avoiding dangerous waste treatment.

Member states must adopt laws suitable for reaching the following overall targets.

• The recovery percentage (materials not sent to a landﬁll) of scrapped vehicles must
be at least 85% of the average vehicle weight, while at least 80% of the weight
must be reemployed. For vehicles produced before 1980, lower targets can be set,
but not lower than 75% for recovery and 70% for recycling.

• The recovery percentage reached 95% by 2015 and the recycling percentage 85%

of the average vehicle weight.

For this purpose, components and materials must be code labelled, to enhance

identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation for selective recovery.

Scrapped vehicle treatment must include the separation from scrap of the follow-

ing items:

19.1 Vehicle System

83

• batteries and gas bottles;
• explosive materials contained air bags;
• ﬂuids, like fuels, lubricants, cooling ﬂuids, brake oil, air conditioning ﬂuids and

others, unless they are necessary to parts reemployment;

• all components including mercury;
• catalysts;
• parts containing copper, aluminum and magnesium;
• tires and big plastic elements removal (bumper, dashboard, reservoirs);
• glasses.

The economic accomplishment of these operations implies a number of additional

• banning certain materials, such as asbestos, lead, cadmium, esavalent chromium,

design rules:

etc.;

• indelible material labelling of any component;
• designing components with a reduced number of materials;
• designing an easy disassembly;
• identiﬁcation of components suitable for a second life.

In the near future, it is likely that manufacturers will be obliged to accept the

burden of disassembly.

19.2 Tires

According to R 2009/661, member States are required to homologate tires also as a
component, independent of the vehicle where they should be installed.

This Regulation reports the standard identiﬁcation system that was explained in
the ﬁrst volume. This system allows us to identify geometrical dimensions, inﬂation
pressure and admitted load at reference conditions.

The homologation certiﬁcate of a tire must report the following information:

• application category;
• type of structure;
• maximum allowed speed;
• maximum admitted load in simple and twin assembly;
• the necessity of any tube;
• the type, as between the following: for cars; reinforced; for commercial and indus-

trial vehicles; for temporary use on spare wheels (T type);

• description and dimensions of carcass structure;
• admitted rim dimensions for its application.

84

19 Regulations

Tires are classiﬁed in the following categories:

• class C1 tires: designed primarily for vehicles of categories M1, N1, O1 and O2;
• class C2 tires: designed primarily for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N, O3 and
O4 with a load capacity index in single formation below 121 and a speed category
symbol higher then N;

• class C3 tires: designed primarily for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N, O3 and O4
with one of the following load capacity indices: below 121 and a speed category
symbol lower than M, or a load capacity index in single formation below 122.

A tire may be classiﬁed in more than one class provided that it meets all the
relevant requirements of each class in which it is classiﬁed. The list of load-capacity
indices and their corresponding masses contained in UNECE R 30 and 54 shall apply.
Again the R 2009/661 provides that all vehicles of category M1 shall be equipped
with an accurate tire pressure monitoring system capable of giving, when necessary,
an in-car warning to the driver when a loss of pressure occurs in any tire, in the
interests of optimum fuel consumption and road safety.

All class C1 tyres shall meet the following wet grip requirements:

• snow tires with a speed symbol Q or below, excluding H, indicating a maximum

speed not exceeding 160 km/h should feature a minimum grip index of 0.9;

• snow tires with a speed symbol R or above, excluding H, indicating a maximum

speed exceeding 160 km/h should feature a minimum grip index of 1.0;

• normal tires should feature a minimum grip index of 1.1;

All tires shall also feature a maximum rolling resistance f0 of:

• 10.1 kg/t for class C1,
• 9.0 kg/t for class C2,
• 6.5 kg/t for class C3.

Snow tires are allowed of a f0 coefﬁcient increased of 1 kg/t. Rolling resistance

should be measured according to the ISO 28580 standard.

This Regulation limits also the rolling noise produced by the tire, in order to
contribute to the vehicle overall noise reduction; although we do not comment about
Directives on outside noise, because this topic is part of the engine and its intake and
exhaust systems design, we will describe brieﬂy what pertains to the tire.

This Regulation presents a reproducible test method to evaluate the noise produced

by tires rolling on a paved road.

The proposed test method consists of driving a vehicle with the test tire on a
measurement course, as represented in Fig. 19.8; the vehicle must be launched and
cross the course with idle gear and engine off.

Also the remaining test conditions are prescribed, as the speciﬁcations of the

pavement and how to process signals from the microphones M.

The test speed is:

• 80 km/h for tires of C1 and C2 classes;
• 70 km/h for tires of C3 class.

Noise limits are reported in Table 19.3.
R 30 and 54 summarize all matters regarding tires respectively for M1 vehicles,
for M2 and M3 vehicles, while R 64 repurts rules about run ﬂat tires and temporary
wheels. They are spare wheels, complete with tire and disc, with differences only in
design details, that limits its application to certain conditions only.

The development of these wheels is justiﬁed by the need for bulk containment in
the trunk, when more than one tire size applies to a vehicle, or when the ordinary
wheels are judged to be too expensive.

These wheels must observe the rules of R 30, implying that the tire is designed for
the load of the heavily loaded wheel and for a maximum speed of at least 120 km/h;
temporary wheels must show an indelible label prescribing a use limited to a short
distance and 80 km/h maximum speed.

The same indications must be reported in the user manual, which also prohibits

the simultaneous use of more than one temporary wheel on the same vehicle.

86

19 Regulations

The regulation identiﬁes ﬁve different types of spare wheel:

• Type 1 is a temporary-use spare tire speciﬁcally designed and intended only for

temporary-use under restricted driving conditions;

• Type 2 is an assembly in which the wheel has a different offset from that designed

• Type 3 is an assembly in which the tire is of a different structure from that ﬁtted

• Type 4 is an assembly in which tire and wheel dimensions differ from those ﬁtted

for normal operation;

for normal operation;

for normal operation;

• Type 5 is an assembly in which a wheel and tire. Fitted for normal long term road

use, can be used in an emergency in a totally deﬂated condition.

A full load braking test must be performed with the temporary wheel in all possible

positions.

The braking test is the same as prescribed by R 13: for instance, for M1 vehicles
and wheels of types 1, 2, 3 and 5, with a pedal load lower than 500 N, the stopping
distance from 80 km/h shall not exceed 50.7 m; for wheels of type 4, the stopping
distance from 120 km/h shall not exceed 108 m.

The required performance must be obtained without wheel lock, deviation from

the initial path or excessive corrections on the steering wheel.

19.3 Steering System

According to D 1992/62, the steering system includes all means in the vehicle used
to determine its trajectory on the road.

The performance of this system is ruled by speciﬁcations regarding:

• the steering control, where the driver applies its action to keep or to modify the

vehicle trajectory,

• the steering transmission, connecting the control with the steered wheels,
• the energy supply, if applied, to help the driver in its steering action.

Motor vehicles are allowed to have one of the following kinds of equipment:
• a manual one, if the steering forces result solely from the muscular effort of the

driver;

• a power assisted one if the steering forces result from both the muscular effort of the
driver and the energy supply; in this category are also included steering equipment
in which the steering forces result solely from one or more energy supplies when
the equipment is intact, but in which the steering forces can be provided by the
muscular effort of the driver alone if there is a fault;

• a full-power one in which the steering forces are provided solely by one or more

energy supplies.

The deﬁnition of power assisted steering equipment opens a future transition to
autonomous drive, but at this time, steering equipment with a purely pneumatic, elec-
tric or hydraulic transmission are prohibited, until speciﬁc requirements are added
to this Directive.

This prohibition does not apply to steering equipment for vehicles of Category O.
It should be noticed that this condition applies only if all steering wheels full-power
type; for this purpose, hydrostatic steering (steering wheel moving a hydrostatic
power distributor with wheels steered by hydrostatic actuators) is, for instance, not
admitted, but an additional axis on a truck, steering only under the action of the
cornering forces, is admitted.

The maximum permitted steering time and effort on the steering control are spec-
iﬁed in Table 19.4, for a reference turning radius, in case of fully working steering
system and in case of failure of any part of it, for different categories of vehicle. A
fully working system must be able to achieve a turning radius of 12 m, while a failed
one a turning radius of 20 m.

D 1991/662 adds speciﬁcations regarding passive safety.
When the vehicle is tested against a barrier at a speed of 48.3 km/h, the top of the
steering column and its shaft shall not move backwards, horizontally and parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, by more than 12.7 cm in relation to a point of the
vehicle not affected by the impact and 12.7 cm vertically.

When the steering control is struck by a body block simulating human torso,
released against this control at a relative speed of 24.1 km/h, the force applied to the
body by the steering control shall not exceed 1.111 daN.

When the steering control is struck by an impactor, released against this control
at a relative speed of 24.1 km/h, the deceleration of the impactor shall not exceed
80 g for more than 3 ms. The deceleration shall always be lower than 120 g.

The same Directive provides testing procedures to perform the above tests.
In addition, the steering control shall be designed in such a way that no part of
the steering control surface, directed towards the driver, which can be contacted by
a sphere of 165 mm in diameter shall present any roughness or sharp edges with a
radius of curvature of less than 2.5 mm.

88

19 Regulations

Finally, the steering control shall be designed as not to embody components or
accessories, including the horn control, capable of catching in the driver’s clothing
or jewellery in normal driving movements.

The Ofﬁcial Journal of the European Union of May 27th 2008 reports, in the acts
adopted by bodies created by international agreements, the UNECE R 79, regarding
uniform provisions about the approval of vehicles steering equipment.

In this document, the technical progress needed to make the following items

possible is examined:
• the elimination of the steering column for safety,
• the easy transfer of controls to both sides of the vehicle,
• the automatic intervention of steering control, to avoid collisions or roll-overs.

According to the above targets this document allows steering wheel and wheel to

be connected by other than mechanical positive means.

Systems in which the driver has the primary vehicle control, but in which auto-
matic control systems can also intervene, are deﬁned as Advanced Driver Assistance
Steering Systems (ADASS).

It is anticipated that future technology will also allow steering to be inﬂuenced or
controlled by sensors and signals generated either on or off-board the vehicle. This
has led to several concerns regarding responsibility for the primary control of the
vehicle and the absence of any internationally agreed data transmission protocols
with respect to off-board or external control of steering.

Therefore, this Regulation does not permit the general approval of systems that
incorporate functions by which the steering can be controlled by external signals,
for example, transmitted from roadside beacons or active features embedded into the
road surface. Such systems, which do not require the presence of a driver, have been
deﬁned as Autonomous Steering Systems.

Steering systems assisted by means that are in part outside the vehicle are deﬁned
as Lane Guidance, Lane Keeping or Heading Control if they have the job of main-
taining a preset trajectory; they are classiﬁed as Automatically Commanded Steering
Function.

Systems like ADASS can also include devices able to monitor path deviation or

correction in such a way as to improve the vehicle’s dynamic behavior.

This Regulation allows the application of such systems if their presence does not
degrade the operation of the conventional control system. They must be designed in
such a way as to enable the driver to inhibit their operation deliberately; in case of
emergency, a mechanical positive link between steering wheel and wheels must be
reestablished.

If the same source of energy used for steering the car is used for different devices,
steering must be guaranteed. If this source is shared with the braking system, steering
must be given priority; in case of failure the braking efﬁciency must not decay below
certain limits.

The conditions set in Table 19.4 must be always satisﬁed.

19.4 Braking System

19.4 Braking System

89

The D 1971/320, together with the updates introduced by D 1991/422 and D 1998/12,
speciﬁc to braking systems for vehicles of the M, N and O categories, considers as a
braking device any mechanical system having the function of decreasing the speed
or stopping a vehicle gradually, or preventing further motion when stopped.

This device is composed of a control, a brake and a transmission connecting the

above elements together.

The brake is the device developing forces opposed to vehicle motion.
Brake types taken into consideration are:

• friction brakes;
• electric brakes (where braking forces are developed by any electro-magnetic action

between parts with relative motion, but not in contact);

• ﬂuid brakes (where braking forces are developed by a ﬂuid interposed between

• engine brake (where braking forces are produced by an artiﬁcial increase of the

parts with relative motion);

engine braking effect);

• inertia brakes (where the braking forces on a trailer are produced by the reaction

between the trailer and the tractor).

The Directive deﬁnes transmission as any device connecting control with brakes;
this transmission can be mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electric or mixed. When
braking is performed or assisted by an energy source independent of the driver, but
under his control, the energy storage applied to the system is also considered to be
part of the transmission.

The following braking modes are deﬁned:

• adjustable braking, when the driver can, at any time, increase or decrease the force

on the control;

• continuous braking, when a train of vehicles is braked by a unique control that
can be moderated by the driver, at his driver’s seat, and when the braking energy
comes from the same source (as well as the muscle power of the driver);

• semi-continuous braking similar to above, but with energy coming from more than

one source (one source can be the muscle power of the driver);

• automatic braking is the braking of a trailer that occurs automatically when it is
uncoupled from its tractor or when towing devices are broken; in this case, the
braking efﬁciency of the rest of the train must remain unaffected;

• retarder braking, when a supplementary device is able to exert and maintain a
braking force on the vehicle, for a long time, without reduction in efﬁciency; the
term retarder includes the entire system and its control; at this time regenerative
braking systems (used on electric and hybrid vehicles) are not considered to be
part of the braking system.

A generic braking system, as described at the beginning of this paragraph, must

perform one of the following functions.

90

19 Regulations

• Service brake: must allow vehicle speed control, stopping it quickly and safely at
any speed or road slope; it must be adjustable; it must be operated by the driver at
the driver’s seat, with both hands on the steering control.

• Emergency brake: must allow the vehicle to be stopped in a reasonable space, when
the service brake is malfunctioning; it must be adjustable; it must be operated by
the driver at the driver’s seat, with one hand on the steering control.

• Parking brake: must allow the vehicle to remain unmoving on a climbing or

descending slope, even when the driver is absent.

Devices providing service, emergency and parking braking can have common

parts or devices, provided they fulﬁll the following speciﬁcations:

• two independent controls must be available; for all vehicle categories but M2 and
M3, each control (except the retarder control) must return to rest position when
released; this rule does not apply to the parking brake when locked in the braked
position;

• service brake control must be independent of the emergency or parking brake

Braking system speciﬁcations are different for road pavement with high and low

control.

friction coefﬁcients.

High Friction Coefﬁcient

For service brakes, a stop test of 0 type, with cold brakes (when the brake temperature,
measured on the disc or on the outside of the drum, is lower than 100 ◦C) is speciﬁed
to be performed with unloaded and fully loaded vehicle and engine disengaged.

In addition, a stop test of 1 type should be performed, including repeated braking,

as for the following scheme, and of 2 and 2 A type, after long descents.

The type 1 test is performed on a loaded vehicle, after having warmed up the

brakes, according to the rules shown in Table 19.5.

The type 2 test provides that brakes are used when the vehicle is driving a course
on a slope of 6%, 6 km long, at 30 km/h with the most suitable gear ratio and the
retarder, when applicable.

Test type 2 A is similar to the previous one, but with a slope of 7%.

During this test, service, emergency and parking brakes cannot be used. The gear
ratio must be chosen in order to run the engine at a speed not over the maximum
value speciﬁed by the manufacturer. An integrated retarder (which can be operated
by service brakes) can be used in such a way as not to operate the service brakes.

Test 2 A substitutes test 2 for tourism or long distance buses of category M3, and

for vehicles of category N3 allowed to tow trailers of category O4.

All above tests must be run on a high friction coefﬁcient paved road.
The braking system efﬁciency is evaluated by measuring the stopping distance,

the average deceleration and the response time.

The stopping distance is the distance travelled by the vehicle from the time the
brake control is actuated to the time the vehicle is completely stopped; the initial
speed of the test is deﬁned as the speed at the time the driver starts to actuate the
brake control.

In the formulae below, suitable for measuring the braking efﬁciency, V is the
initial speed, s the stopping distance, F the force on the brake pedal, ax the average
obtained deceleration.

The minimum result in Table 19.6 must be measured when the engine is dis-
engaged, and in Table 19.7 when the engine is engaged. On the same tables, the
maximum allowed value for F is reported.

Vehicles of categories M3 and N3 must pass the three tests; vehicles in the remain-

ing categories must pass only type 0 and type 1 tests.

The parking system device must be able to hold a vehicle in place on a slope (both
uphill and downhill slopes must be tested) of at least 18%; for vehicles allowed to
tow trailers, the parking system device must hold vehicle and trailer in place on a
slope of 12%.

If the parking brake is a hand brake, the force on the lever must not exceed 400 N
for vehicles of M category and 600 N for the remaining categories. If it is a pedal
brake, the limits are upgraded to 500 N and 700 N respectively. A device that must
be actuated more than one time to achieve full performance is allowed.

Other limits are prescribed for vehicles of category O and for the response time

of pneumatic brake systems.

The last Directive above also considers ABS or antilock systems; by antilock
system, this Directive refers to all components regulating the slip of one or more
wheels during braking.

Many prescriptions apply to this system; we will quote the main ones only.
Any failure of the electric system or to sensors, including the electric supply,
wiring harness, control systems, or pressure modulator must be signaled to the driver
by a warning light.

This light must be on when the ABS system is on and the vehicle is stopped; the

light goes off, after a short period, to demonstrate that the system is working.

In case of any failure, the residual braking efﬁciency is deﬁned by Table 19.8.
Only off-road vehicles of categories N2 or N3 can have devices able to switch off

the ABS system or to modify its operational mode.

ABS systems must also maintain their efﬁciency when brakes are operated for a

long period of time.

Low Friction Coefﬁcient

For all categories of vehicles, when friction coefﬁcient μx is between 0.2 and 0.8,
the following relationship is applied:

z = ax
g

(cid:3) 0.1 + 0, 85(μx − 0, 2) ,

where ax is the obtained longitudinal deceleration and g is the gravity acceleration;
z is called the braking level.

for a two-axle vehicle.

These formulae consider the pitch rotation equilibrium of a symmetric vehicle

during braking; a complete justiﬁcation of these formulae is given in Part IV.

For every load condition, the friction applied to the front axle must be higher than

applied to the rear one:
• for any braking level between 0.15 and 0.18, for vehicles of M1 category; however
in the range between 0.3 and 0.45 the opposite is admitted if the friction used by
the rear axle does not exceed by 0.05 the value given by μx = z (equal friction
relationship) on a diagram representing fi as function of z;

• for any braking level between 0.15 and 0.18, for vehicles of N1 category; this
condition is considered fulﬁlled if, for braking levels between 0.15 and 0.30, the
used friction curves of each axle lie between the two parallel lines given by the
following equations:

μx = z + 0.08 and μx = z − 0.08,

(19.8)

and if the curve of the friction used by the rear axle (which can cross the line
μx = z − 0.08), for braking levels between 0.3 and 0.5, respects the relationship:

and, between 0.5 and 0.61, respects the relationship:

z (cid:3) μx − 0.08,

z (cid:3) 0.5μx + 0.21;

(19.9)

(19.10)

• for any braking level between 0.15 and 0.30, for other vehicle categories; this
condition is considered fulﬁlled if, for braking levels between 0.15 and 0.30, the
used friction curves of each axle lie between the two parallel lines given by the
following equations:

μx = z + 0.08 and μx = z − 0.08,

(19.11)

and if the curve of friction used by the rear axle, for braking levels z (cid:5) 0.3, follows
the relationship:

z (cid:3) 0.3 + 0.74(μx − 0.38).

(19.12)

19.4 Braking System

95

This set of conditions is used to design the braking distributor, when the braking

system is without ABS or has an electronic brake distributor (EBD).

For vehicles with ABS, the value of obtainable z must be at least 75% of that with

an ideal brake distributor.

Brake Lining

D 98/12 also includes a test procedure that can be applied when a vehicle is modiﬁed
by installing a new type of brake lining, when such vehicle is already homologated,
according to the said Directive.

The new brake lining must be veriﬁed by comparison of its efﬁciency with that
obtained with the original lining at the vehicle homologation test, and it must comply
with the speciﬁcations on the information form.

In this case, a roller dynamometer is also allowed, where roller inertia meets

vehicle values at the homologation test.

As for the entire vehicle, liners must be tested on test types 0, 1, 2 and 2 A; results
are acceptable if the average deceleration, at the same force on the pedal, are included
in a tolerance band as wide as the 15% value obtained by the vehicle homologation
tests.

Lining friction tests are also speciﬁed to prove conformity of production; they are

performed on a simpliﬁed bench, simulating a single brake.

R 90 applies to braking linings used as spare parts.
R 13 summarizes all aspects of the above directives and introduces criteria about
regenerative braking, by distinguishing between A type systems, which are not inte-
grated with the braking system, and B type systems, which are integrated. The braking
effect on A type systems is obtained by releasing the accelerator pedal only, on M1
vehicles and with a separate control on N1 vehicles.

To these systems all prescriptions must be applied; the 0 type test must be per-

formed without regenerative braking.

Brakes Used for Vehicle Control

Road accidents are thought to be a major cause of death in industrial countries.
Numerous intelligent vehicle systems can contribute to reduce this burden. They
support drivers to maintain a safe speed and distance, to drive within the lane, to avoid
overtaking in critical situations and to safely pass intersections in an increasingly
complex driving environment.

These systems are one of the fundamental building blocks of the future autonomous

drive.

Studies on such systems show a high potential. According to E-impact,3 electronic
stability control (ESC) is expected to prevent by far the most fatalities and injuries:
about 3,000 fatalities (−14%), and about 50,000 injuries (−6%) per year. Speed
Alert (Automatic braking imposed by road signals) is expected to contribute with a

improvements of safety and efﬁciency for road transport.

decrease of 5%, e-Call (automatic emergency call in case of collision), with 4%, and
lane keeping support, with 3%; they also have a substantial effects on fatalities.

It is clear though, that the full potential will only become reality with large-
scale deployment in vehicles. As a consequence, R 2009/661 establishes that ESC
is mandatory on all vehicles and R 2012/346 provides that AEBS (advanced emer-
gency braking systems, an automatic braking system depending on safety distance)
is mandatory on M2, M3, N2, N3.

19.5 Structures

The structural behavior of a vehicle is the subject of many Regulations about what
must and must not occur in a collision test, as regards front, rear and lateral impacts,
for M1 vehicles.

Chassis structures work together with the vehicle body in determining the behavior
in front and rear impact, but the body plays a major role also if these structures are not
limited to an underbody only, but there is a true separated chassis frame; the energy
absorbed by the body deformation is fundamental. For side impact, the underbody
plays a marginal role.

Nevertheless we will outline, for the sake of completeness, the UNECE R 12, 14,
16, 33 and 94 which deﬁne test procedures to guarantee occupant safety in case of
front impact.

The vehicle impacts a deformable barrier, according to the scheme in Fig. 19.9;

the vehicle under test must be at the reference weight condition.

On each of the front seats, a dummy Hybrid III type must be accommodated and
wear the provided passive restraint systems. The accommodation geometry and seat
adjustment is speciﬁed by the Regulations.

protection capacity. At left is the side view of the barrier; at right, the upper view of the impact
position

The vehicle can be driven on its own or by an external device; at the impact time

the steering system must be free and the propulsion system idle.

The impact speed must be 56 km/h, with a tolerance band of ±1 km/h. However,
if the impact speed is higher and the test results comply with prescriptions, the test
is considered as passed.

The vehicle path must be offset by 40% of the vehicle width (with a tolerance of
±20 mm), with reference to the vertical symmetry plane of the barrier. This offset
was introduced, differently from the previous Directive, to take into account for
the fact that most collisions between vehicles are not symmetric, but offset to their
normal driving direction; cars homologated for countries with left-hand drive must
have right-hand steering wheels and must be tested in symmetric position, as in the
above scheme.

The barrier is positioned so as to have the ﬁrst contact point with the vehicle on

the driver’s side.

The deformable barrier is designed to simulate a reference vehicle that is hit in

the collision; for this purpose, it is made up of more elements:
• a main honeycomb aluminum structure;
• an element with the shape and position of a bumper, made of aluminum honey-

comb;

• a reaction plate, bolted to a foundation;
• a cover plate for the bumper, made again of aluminum.

The front side of the barrier must be perpendicular to the vehicle impact direction
with a tolerance of ±1◦. The foundation mass must be at least 70,000 kg and its
displacement must be limited by a concrete block. Barrier dimensions are shown on
the left in Fig. 19.9.

During this test, many measurements are made to verify the performance criteria;
different accelerometers are set on the dummy and on the car and the impact scene
is shot by a high speed video camera.

The performance criteria involve the following limits:

• dummy head acceleration, processed according to a particular method taking into

account the impact duration time;

• shear and traction forces on the dummy neck;
• thorax compression and compression speed;
• femur compression, as a function of time;
• tibia compression;
• rotula shear.

The values of these limits are derived by biomechanics studies on the human body

and are continuously reﬁned.

Beside the homologation test, rating tests by specialized independent laboratories
and of specialized magazines become more and more relevant; the most famous of
these is Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme).

Euro NCAP is a consortium between the main German Motoring Club (ADAC),
the German, English and Dutch Transportation Ministries, the European Union and

98

19 Regulations

other partners, whose objective is to inform consumers about the passive safety of
cars available on the market; information on Euro NCAP and available test results
can be read on the internet site:

www.euroncap.com.

These tests results are scored and usually balanced in a ﬁnal overall ﬁgure on
vehicle safety, ranging from excellence to adequacy, measured by the number of
stars.

There are tests similar to those reported by regulations but with additional severity
in test procedures (for instance, by increasing impact speed) and in their evaluation
scale, as well as new tests analyzing issues not already regulated (for instance, pedes-
trian impact was already rated before the issuance of the related law).

The peculiarity of rating tests is that they have reached a high level of reputation
and have become important markers of product competitiveness. As a matter of fact,
rating results have become an additional standard for car manufacturers.

Finally, the quest for higher rating evaluations contributes to raising the safety level

of the operating ﬂeet and promoting the improvement of the existing regulations.

Part IV
The Chassis as a Part
of the Vehicle System

Introduction

After studying the main components of the vehicle chassis and deﬁning the goals the
designer of a motor vehicle must meet, to comply with the standards and to satisfy
the requirements of customers, the fourth part of this book is devoted to the study of
the vehicle chassis as a system.

The behavior of the chassis as a whole has much more inﬂuence on the overall
characteristics of a motor vehicle in terms of performance, handling, safety, and
comfort than the characteristics of any single component. All complex machines
must be studied and optimized at a system level, and this surely holds for motor
vehicles as well.

After a short chapter devoted to the geometric and inertial properties of motor
vehicles, properties that are highly dependent on those of the chassis, some basic
ideas on vehicle aerodynamics and prime movers will be presented. We are going to
introduce prime movers instead of engines only, because electric motors with their
batteries are coming up beside the traditional internal combustion engines and are
expected to play a major role in the road vehicles market in the next years. Strictly
speaking, both these subjects go beyond the study of the vehicular chassis, since they
deal mainly with the other two systems constituting the motor vehicle (the body and
the engine), but their inﬂuence on performance is too important to be neglected in
the study of the chassis. They will be studied in a synthetic way, examining only
those aspects that are essential in the study of the chassis: the reader can ﬁnd all the
relevant details in specialized texts.

Two chapters dealing with the longitudinal dynamics of the motor vehicle, aimed
at studying its performance both in acceleration and braking, will follow. In this
study, many of the subsystems and components studied in Volume 1 are essential,
namely, the wheels and tires, the brakes and the driveline.

The following chapter is devoted to the study of lateral dynamics, an essential
feature for assessing handling performance and active safety. In this chapter, only
the lateral dynamics of the vehicle as a rigid body will be studied, and the effect of

100

Part IV: The Chassis as a Part of the Vehicle System

suspensions will not be dealt with, since it requires the use of more sophisticated
mathematical models that will be introduced in Part V.

Suspensions will be introduced in the following chapter, which is devoted to the
study of comfort. After a short section dealing with excitations due to the vehicle
itself and to the road, and another one dealing with the response of the human body
to vibration, the ﬁltering characteristics of the chassis, due primarily to suspensions
but also to tires, will be studied with the aim of obtaining satisfactory riding comfort.
The last chapter will be devoted to recently introduced automatic control devices. It
is predicted that in the future they will become widespread with the aim of improving
comfort and assisting the driver, especially when poor road conditions make his task
more difﬁcult.

Chapter 20
General Characteristics

20.1 From Animal Traction Vehicles to Motor Vehicles

As explained in the ﬁrst volume, initially motor vehicles adopted the basic conﬁg-
urations which had been used since millennia for animal traction vehicles. Since
the fourth millennium BC there were two wheeled carts and four wheeled wagons:
the former were used for lighter loads and, above all, when speed and maneuvrabil-
ity were important, while the second developed only for carrying (relatively) heavy
loads.

Two wheeled carts initially developed for military purposes (war chariots) and
then, when the use of chivalry made war chariots obsolete, had a large use in chariot
races, one of the most popular spectator’s sports in the Greek and Roman world.
The early war chariots were pulled by one (or better, two or even four) onagers
(Mesopotamia’s wild donkeys) which in the second millennium BC were substituted
by horses. In itself a two wheeled chariot is unstable and the animal(s) not only
supplied the tractive pull, but also supported the front part of the vehicle, instead
of the (non-existant) front axle. They were very maneuvrable and could be fast but,
owing to the limited traction force which horses (or donkeys) could exert—due to
the failure to understand that the harness used at that time to attach the draw animals
to the vehicle was pushing on the wind-pipe of the animal, choking it—, couldn’t
carry large loads.

Two axle wagons, on the contrary, could carry heavier loads, but before Roman
times they were very little maneovrable because, not being provided with a steering
system, they could be forced on a curved trajectory only with large efforts exerted
by the driver, who had to pull the front of the vehicle sideways. These vehicles
were mostly pulled by oxen. In several places archeologists found ’rail systems’:
rails dug in the road surface to guide the vehicles along a curved trajectory, in many
cases even supplied with switches, which allowed vehicles to cross. Actually, these
vehicles behaved more like rail cars than road vehicles. Starting from roman times
wagons were provided with a steering front axle, similar to what is still used in most
trailers. The steering was controlled by the draw animal through the draw-bar.
In the middle ages the steering system was consolidated, and the improvements
in the harness to attach horses to vehicles and agricultural machinery allowed large
improvements to mobility.

When the ﬁrst attempts to build motor vehicles were performed, these basic con-
ﬁgurations were adopted (perhaps mostly unconsciously) as conceptual models, as
introduced in Volume I. Carts with one axle were supplied with a front wheel which
could substitute the horse in its support function and sometimes also in its pulling
function: the ﬁrst of these tri-cycles which actually worked, the Fardier by Cugnot,
had a steerable front driving wheels, operated by a steam engine. Other tri-cycles,
like the most famous one built by Benz, on the contrary had a front steering wheel,
vehicle tractive forces were supplied by the two wheels of the rear axle. The front
steering wheel had to be controlled directly by the human driver through a handle, a
handle bar or a steering wheel.

Another solution was starting from a two axle wagon: in this case the horse had
no support function, so it was enough to remove the draw-bar and to give the control
of the steering of the front axle directly to the human driver, again through a handle,
a handle bar or a steering wheel. Propulsion had to be supplied through an axle with
two wheels, which should compel to using a differential, even if there were cases
in which each one of the driving wheels were supplied by a separate steam engine,
and even cases in which only one of the wheels of the driving axle was powered.
Initially the idea was that the driving axle had to be the front axle—after all the
horse was pulling the wagon and not pushing it—but this implied the difﬁculty of
mixing steering and driving on the same axle. This was fairly easy if the steering was
based on an ‘articulated steering’ system (see Fig. 20.9), but since the last part of
the eighteen century Erasmus Darwin had demonstrated that it was better that each
wheel could steer independently in a coordinated way (‘coordinated steering’) and
so combining the steering and driving functions on the same axle was not easy at all.
Most of the early vehicles had thus the steering on the front axle and traction of the
rear one. It must be said that at the beginning many manufacturers sold a motorized
front axle, provided with an electric motor-battery system, which could substitute
the front axle of a horse-driven coach to convert it into a motor car.

20.2 Possible Conﬁgurations for a Motor Vehicle

A number of possible wheel conﬁgurations for motor vehicles are shown in Fig. 20.1
In the previous section it was shown that several early motor cars were based on the
tri-cycle conﬁguration (possibly with the single wheel at the front, conﬁgurations
3A or 3B in the ﬁgure) or on four wheels at the vertices of a rectangle (conﬁguration
4A)—even if at least one of the early steam coaches had a conﬁguration here labelled
as 4B Fig. 20.5.

All conﬁgurations with two wheels are unstable, in particular conﬁgurations 1A
and 2A practically require a stabilizing device because only a few circus acrobat can
successfully ride unicycles. Conﬁguration 2B on the contrary can be stabilized by

Fig. 20.1 Some of the possible wheel conﬁgurations for motor vehicles with 1–6 wheels

any trained human controller. Conﬁgurations with 3 wheels are statically determined
and strictly speaking do not need suspensions, at least when travelling at low speed.
All conﬁgurations with more than 3 wheels need suspensions for distributing suitably
the load on the ground.

In particular:

• Vehicles with 1 wheel. Unycycles have recently been used as Urban Personal
Mobility (UPM) vehicles—for instance Segway commercialized the electric
Ninebot unicycle, followed by other manufacturers (see Fig. 20.2). As already
stated, these devices need to be actively stabilized about two axes (roll and pitch
axes).

• Vehicles with two wheels. Two wheelers of the type 2A also need to be actively
stabilized, but about a single axis (pitch axis). Apart from the well known Segway
(the ﬁrst active vehicle with two wheels laterally aligned ever built) the same
manufacturer built, in partnership with GM a true UPM with an enclosed cabin
with two seats (Fig. 20.3).
Vehicles of the 2B type are too common to be mentioned (bicycles and motor
bikes), but recently vehicles with the same wheel conﬁguration, but with small
wheels and the driver in a standing position, were introduced: the electric scooter
(Fig. 20.3c).

• Vehicles with three wheels. As already stated, tri-cycles were quite common at the
beginning of motor vehicle technology but have always been popular, particularly
in Great Britain, owing to the lighter tax pressure since they were considered from
a ﬁscal point of view as motorcycles and not cars. In India small three wheeled
vehicles for both passenger and goods transportation have also been always very
common. Most of the vehicles shown in Fig. 20.4 are of the 3A type, but if we
consider the large amount of the Piaggio Ape sold, in particular in India, perhaps
the 3B conﬁguration has been more popular. To improve stability, three wheeled
vehicles can be provided with a tilting system (Fig. 20.4d and e). The tilting control
can be entrusted to the driver, like in motor bikes, or be performed automatically.

300; f The three-wheeled motor cycle Piaggio P3

Recently Piaggio, and other motorcycle manufactures, introduced three wheeled
motor cycles, with a 3B conﬁguration: they are particularly suitable for urban use,
on poor road surfaces.
The 3C conﬁguration seems to be odd, since it doesn’t have a symmetry plane,
but it is the typical conﬁguration of motor cycles with a sidecar, so it has been
quite popular, particularly in the middle of the twentieth century.

• Vehicles with four wheels. The great majority of four wheeled vehicles follows
the 4A scheme: the wheels are located at the vertices of a rectangle. This is the
typical conﬁguration of motor cars, but also lighter vehicles, like quadricycles and
even some motor bikes similar to the one of Fig. 20.4f but with two wheels also
at the rear, follow the same conﬁguration. In the latter case, the vehicle can tilt in
bends to improve stability.
Although odd, the conﬁguration 4B was used at least in two cases: the steam
coach built by Church in 1832 and the Pininfarina X of 1960 (Fig. 20.5). Also
conﬁguration 4C and 4D were sometimes used, but were regarded as tricycles
with the axle with a single wheel provided with a twin tire (4C equivalent to 3A
and 4D equivalent to 3B).

• As far as known, conﬁgurations with 5 wheels were seldom used and the few
cases are tri-cycles of the 3B type with and additional axle at the rear end to be
transformed into the 5C conﬁguration.

106

• Six-wheeled conﬁgurations are mostly used for industrial vehicles. Solution 6A,
in which the axles are equidistant, is used for a few vehicles, mostly off-road or
military, (Fig. 20.6), while most trucks have the rear axles close (tandem axle) to
each other and the front axle far away (conﬁguration 6B). Seldom the two axles
close to each other are located at the front (conﬁguration 6C) and in this case both
the front axles are steering. The latter conﬁguration was even used in a formula
1 car. Conﬁgurations 6D and 6E have never been used, at least at the authors’
knowledge.

• Vehicles with more than six wheels and possibly made by a number of different
units. Many vehicles, particularly industrial vehicles, have more than 6 wheels or
even are made of more than 1 unit. For instance a vehicle with 4 wheels with con-
ﬁguration 4A can pull a trailer with conﬁguration 4A: the resulting tractor trailer

108

20 General Characteristics

conﬁguration can be deﬁned as a vehicle with 8 wheels, with 4A-4A conﬁguration.
The trailer can actually be a semitrailer, i.e. a trailer which is supported at the front
end by the previous element (the tractor or another trailer) through an hitch instead
of wheels.
Consider a generic multibody vehicle made of n bodies (a tractor and a set of n − 1
trailers (Fig. 20.7). In the ﬁgure symbol H is used to indicate a hitch, so what fol-
lows an H is a semitrailer. While in Europe no vehicle with multiple trailers is
legal for road use, in America and Australia such vehicles are legal but subject to
restrictions.

20.3 Conﬁguration of the Steering System

The impression of the driver of a road vehicle is that the wheels are in pure rolling,
i.e., the velocity of the center of the wheel lies in its midplane, and that the trajectory
is controlled by setting the steering wheels at a given steering angle δ (Fig. 20.8a), so
that the trajectory is controlled in a geometrical way (or better in a kinematic way).
However, this ‘kinematic steering’ is impossible except at very low speed (or, better,
at a speed tending to zero) and in absence of any lateral force. To exert a lateral
force at the wheel-road interface the wheel must work with a sideslip angle α, i.e.
the velocity of the center of the wheel cannot lie in its midplane.

Two basic functions can be identiﬁed in all types of vehicles: Propulsion and
trajectory control. As far as the second issue is concerned, all vehicles can be divided
into two categories:

(a) Guided vehicles, or better, kinematically guided vehicles, whose trajectory is

ﬁxed by a set of kinematic constraints;

Fig. 20.8 a Vehicle on a curved trajectory: geometrical deﬁnitions of angles αi , β, and δi . b Time
histories of the steering angle and of the sideslip angles of the wheels during a manoever to enter a
bend (subscrits referred to the axles and not to the single wheels)

20.3 Conﬁguration of the Steering System

109

(b) piloted vehicles, in which the trajectory, a tri-dimensional or a planar curve, is
determined by a guidance system, controlled by a human pilot or by a device,
usually electro-mechanical. The guidance system acts by exerting forces on the
vehicle which are able to change its trajectory.

In the ﬁrst case the kinematic constraint exerts all forces needed to modify the
trajectory without any deformation, i.e. is assumed to be inﬁnitely stiff and inﬁnitely
strong. A perfect kinematic guidance is therefore an abstraction, although it is well
approximated in many actual cases.

In the second case the forces are due to the changes of the attitude of the vehicle
which in turn are caused by forces and moments due to the guidance devices. These
vehicles can be said to be dynamically guided.

Apart from the cases of space vehicles in which the forces needed to change the
trajectory are directly exerted by thrusters (usually rockets), there may be two cases:
The attitude changes can be quite large, large enough to be directly felt by the pilot
or driver, or small enough to be unnoticed. The ﬁrst case is that of aerodynamically
or hydrodynamically controlled vehicles, in which the pilot acts on a control surface,
causing the changes of attitude needed to generate the forces which modify the
trajectory. There is also usually a certain delay between the changes of attitude and
the actual generation of forces and consequently the driver feels clearly that a dynamic
control, i.e. a control through the application of forces, takes place.

In the case of road vehicles the situation is similar but the driver has a completely
different impression: The driver operates the steering wheel causing some wheels to
work with a sideslip and to generate lateral forces. These forces cause a change of
attitude of the vehicle (change of the vehicle sideslip angle β, Fig. 20.8a), and then a
sideslip angle α of all wheels: The resulting forces bend the trajectory. This sequence
of events is clearly shown in Fig. 20.8b, where the time history of the steering angle
and of the sideslip angles of the wheels are reported.

The manoever is a ‘ramp’ steering input: the steering angle is increased linearity
in a short time to enter a bend. The sideslip angle of the fronte wheels α1 (subscrits
referred to the axles and not to the single wheels) rapidly increases, producing the
side forces (and the moment about the centre of mass G) needed to put the vehicle
in a suitable sideslip attitude. As a consequence, also the sideslip angle of the rear
wheels α2 increases and when the steady state conditions are reached, in this case,
the sideslip angles of the two wheels are equal: the vehicle is neutral steer, as it will
be shown later.

However, the linearity of the behaviour of the tires and the smallness of the sideslip
angles αi give the driver the impression of a kinematic, not dynamic, driving. The
wheels seem to be in pure rolling and the trajectory seems to be determined by the
directions of the midplanes of the wheels. A vehicle having a good handling behavior
seems to behave ‘like it were on rails’, as is often said, and this delay is not perceived.
This impression has inﬂuenced the study of the handling of motor vehicles for a
long time, originating the very concept of kinematic steering and in a sense hiding
the true meaning of the phenomena.

110

20 General Characteristics

Fig. 20.9 Steering of a wheeled rover or vehicle. a Slip steering; b articulated steering; c coordinated
steering, d independent steering

The impression of the driver is in good accordance with this kinematic approach,
at least for all the linear part of the behaviour of the tire. When high values of the
sideslip angles are reached, the average driver has the impression of losing control
of the vehicle, much more so if this occurs abruptly. This impression is conﬁrmed
by the fact that in normal road conditions, particularly if radial tires are used, the
sideslip angles become large only when approaching the limit lateral forces.

These considerations are only an indication, as there are cases in between those
considered here like kinematic guidance with deformable constraints or magnetic
levitation vehicles. The difference turns out to be more quantitative than qualitative,
and depends mostly on the greater or smaller “stiffness” with which the vehicle
responds to the variations of attitude due to the guidance devices.

In most motor vehicles the steering function is implemented in the following ways

(Fig. 20.9):

• Slip steering (a).1 There is no steering mechanism, but the driving wheels can
produce differential traction on the two sides of the vehicle. This can be achieved by

1Sometimes the term skid steering is used instead of slip steering. It should be avoided, since this
way of steering is due to longitudinal and lateral slip of the wheels, but only in extreme cases it
produced actual skidding (i.e. global slipping) of the wheels on the ground. The term skid steering
should be reserved to the latter case.

20.3 Conﬁguration of the Steering System

111

using independent motors in the wheels or two motors actuating the wheels of the
two sides independently, or by using an active differential gear (torque vectoring).
The brakes can also be used in differential mode to achieve some slip steering.
Very small trajectory curvature radius can be obtained by rotating backwards the
wheels on one side, and turning on the spot is possible by using equal and opposite
rotation speed. In the latter case, however, actual skidding takes place and the term
skid steering is adequate. No kinematic steering (see Sect. 25.1.1) is possible.
• Articulated steering (b1 and b2). One or more axles, carrying each the wheels at
both sides, are articulated and can steer under the control of one or more actuators.
The body may be made of two or more subunits (b2), each carrying one or more
axles, or the wheels can be carried by bogies, pivoted under the body (b1). If each
subunit carries only one axle, kinematic steering (see Sect. 25.1.1) is possible. The
steering may be controlled by one or more actuators or by differential driving or
braking of the wheels at the two sides of an axle, in a way similar to what seen for
slip steering.

• Coordinated steering (c1, c2 and c3). The two wheels of the same axle steer about
two different steering axes (kingpin axes), but their steering angles are coordinated
by a mechanical linkage. Most automotive vehicles have a steering of this kind. If
the linkage satisﬁes the Ackerman condition (see below), an Ackerman steering,
making kinematic steering possible, is realized. However, no practical steering
linkage, like the much used Jeantaud linkage, realizes an exact Ackerman steering.2
If more than one axle is steering (c2 and c3), the steering angles of the various
axles may be independent or (seldom) coordinated by another mechanical linkage.
• Independent steering (d1 and d2). Each wheel of one axle or of more axles can
steer independently about a steering (kingpin) axis, under the action of an actua-
tor. The possibility of realizing the Ackerman conditions (thus making kinematic
steering possible) depends on the steering control system. If large steering angles
are possible, and the control system is ﬂexible enough, any kind of trajectory can
be obtained, including turning on the spot, moving sideways, etc.

20.4 Suspension Conﬁgurations

As already stated in Sect. 3.1 of Vol. 1, if the number of wheels is larger than three,
a rigid vehicle is a statically undetermined system. The structure of the vehicle must
then either be compliant enough or include a compliant connection between the
wheels and the body. In all motor vehicles the second solution is followed, while
the ﬁrst one, which was widely used in the past for wagons with animal traction, is
now restricted to particularly slow vehicles. However there are cases in which the
compliance of the structure acts together with the presence of the suspensions and
has an important effect on the characteristics of the vehicle.

2Enrico Bernardi, the ﬁrst car manufacturer in Italy, invented a mechanism of this kind in 1886 but
its mechanical complexity discouraged any further development.

112

20 General Characteristics

The suspensions have two main functions:

• Distributing the load on the ground in a way corresponding to the design goals
and allowing the vehicle to sit in the proper attitude, under the effect of the static
and quasi-static loads in stationary conditions;

• allowing the wheels to follow an uneven road proﬁle without transferring excessive

loads and accelerations to the vehicle body.

For the ﬁrst task the suspensions may be just an articulated system or may include
elastic elements, linear or nonlinear, while for the second they must also incorporate
damping, at least to avoid the onset of resonant oscillations.

The second task is so important that suspensions are also used in the case of
vehicles with two wheels, which do not need them to distribute the loads on the
ground in a predictable way.

Theoretically both tasks could be performed by the tires also in the case of rigid
vehicles, but their compliance is not sufﬁcient and their damping is too low to do it
in a satisfactory way.

Ideally, the suspensions should allow the wheels to move with respect to the
body of the vehicle in a direction perpendicular to the road, maintaining the plane
of the wheel parallel to itself and constraining all motions in longitudinal and lateral
directions: A suspension of a single wheel should be a system with a single degree
of freedom, the displacement in the direction perpendicular to the road.

However, none of the systems which are used at present are able to perform in that
way and each one of them has a peculiar behaviour; the approximations with which
the suspensions perform their task of constraining the ﬁve other degrees of freedom
of the wheel hub are important in giving any particular vehicle its own character.
Generally speaking, suspensions can be subdivided into two different types:

• axle suspensions, in which the two wheels of a given axle are suspended together

and

• independent suspensions, in which each wheel is attached independently to the

chassis through its own suspension (Fig. 20.10b).

In the ﬁrst case, the traditional solution is attaching the two wheels to a rigid
structure (solid axle suspensions) which has two degrees of freedom with respect to
the vehicle chassis (Fig. 20.10a), but today often one of the two degrees of freedom
is linked to the torsional compliance of the beam which connects the two wheels
(torsion beam axle, (Fig. 20.10c).

These are general types, however, and each one of them may be realized in a variety
of conﬁgurations, each one with its characteristic behavior, cost, and application. So
we have Hotchkiss axles, De Dion axles, etc., for solid axle suspensions, or double
wishbone, Mc Pherson, trailing arms suspensions and many other types.

Even if the design of the suspension is very important for the behavior of the
vehicle from all points of view (handling, comfort safety, etc.) perhaps this aspect
of vehicle design has not received recently much attention, except for what active
suspensions are concerned.

20.5 Symmetry Considerations

Motor vehicles, like most machines, have a general bilateral symmetry. Only hypothe-
ses can be advanced to explain why this occurs. Certainly to have a symmetry plane
simpliﬁes the study of the dynamic behavior of the system, for it can be modelled,
within certain limits, using uncoupled equations. However, the reason is likely to
be above all an aesthetic one: symmetry is considered an essential feature in most
deﬁnitions of beauty.

All complex animals that evolved on our planet, including humans, have a symme-
try plane deﬁned by a vertical axis and an axis running in the longitudinal direction;
symmetry is, however, not complete since some internal organs are positioned in an
unsymmetrical way and some small deviations from symmetry are always present
even in exterior appearance. When such lack of symmetry is too evident, it is felt to
be incompatible with the aesthetic canons developed by all human civilizations.

A similar situation is encountered in all objects built by humans and, as in our
interest here, in motor vehicles: a general outer symmetry and a certain lack of
symmetry in the location of the internal components. Among the most common road
vehicles, the only case where such a symmetry is not present is that of motorbikes
with sidecar; these are, however, perceived to be made by a main unit, the motor
bike, that has bilateral symmetry, plus a second unit, the sidecar, attached on a side,
as its name suggests.

114

20 General Characteristics

The sidecar often has its own symmetry plane, even if such characteristics are
neither needed nor useful. This consideration may conﬁrm the idea that symmetry
has, in vehicles, purely an aesthetic justiﬁcation.

A few other vehicles, built for very specialized use, like mobile cranes and con-
struction site vehicles, have a non-symmetrical shape when strong functional reasons
dictate it, but these are vehicles in which aesthetic considerations are utterly unim-
portant.

Many industrial vehicles may perhaps draw advantages from an asymmetrical
architecture, for instance with the cab on one side and the loading surface on the
other to use all the available length. Such a conﬁguration seems, however, to be
so unnatural as to be considered only if strictly needed. Imagination could at this
point be set free to devise architectures that are not only without bilateral symmetry,
but are even fully non-symmetrical, but this would likely be useless, since these
conﬁgurations would seem to be unacceptable.

If the vehicle were completely symmetrical, the center of mass would lie in the
symmetry plane. Actually, as already said, the mechanical systems and the load
distribution are often not exactly symmetrical, so that the mass center can be displaced
from it. In practice, the distance of the mass center from the symmetry plane is small.

20.6 Reference Frames

The study of the motion of motor vehicles is usually performed with reference to
some reference frames that are more or less standardized. They are (Fig. 20.11):
• Earth-ﬁxed axis system X Y Z . This is a right-hand reference frame ﬁxed on the
road. In the following sections, it will always be regarded as an inertial frame,
even if strictly speaking it is not such as it moves along with the Earth: The inertial
effects due to its motion (rotation about its axis, orbiting about the Sun, the galactic
center, ...) are so small that they can be neglected in all phenomena studied in motor
vehicle dynamics. Axes X and Y lie in a horizontal plane while axis Z is vertical,
pointing upwards.3

• Vehicle axis system x yz. This is a right-hand reference frame ﬁxed to the vehicle’s
center of mass and moving with it. As already stated, if the vehicle has a symmetry
plane, the center of mass is assumed to lie in the origin. The x-axis lies in the
symmetry plane of the vehicle in an almost horizontal direction.4 The z-axis lies
in the symmetry plane, is perpendicular to the x-axis, and points upwards. The
y-axis is perpendicular to the other two.5 The y-axis, then, points to the left of the

3Recommendation SAE J670 and ISO/TC 22/SC9 standard state that the Z -axis is vertical and
points downwards. Note that in the present text the direction of the Y and Z axes is opposite to that
suggested in the mentioned standard.
4The mentioned standard states that the x-axis is contained in the plane of symmetry of the vehicle,
is “substantially” horizontal and points forward.
5Here again there is a deviation from the mentioned standard.

driver. In the case of vehicles without a symmetry plane, the x z plane is identiﬁed
by the direction of motion when the wheels are not steered and by a direction
perpendicular to the road in the reference position of the vehicle.

The projections of the vehicle-ﬁxed axes x yz and of the velocity on the plane X Y
of the inertial frame are shown in Fig. 20.12. The angle between the projection of
the x-axis and the X -axis is the yaw angle ψ. The projection of the velocity of the
center of mass on the X Y -plane is here conﬂated with the absolute velocity, since
the component of the latter in a direction perpendicular to the road is usually very
small.

The velocity of the air with respect to the ground, or ambient wind velocity va,
is deﬁned as the horizontal component of the air velocity relative to the earth-ﬁxed
axis system in the vicinity of the vehicle in the inertial frame X Y Z .

The resultant air velocity (i.e. the velocity of the air with respect to the vehicle)
Vr is the difference between the ambient wind velocity and the projection of the
absolute velocity V of the vehicle. The velocity of the vehicle with respect to air is
−Vr and coincides with the absolute velocity V when the air is still, i.e. when the
ambient wind velocity va is zero.

The angle between the projection on the X Y plane of the x-axis and that of the
velocity vector V is the sideslip angle β of the whole vehicle; sometimes referred to
as the attitude angle. As it was the case for the sideslip angle of the tire α, it is positive

116

20 General Characteristics

when vector V points to the left of the driver (in forward motion). In a similar way
it is possible to deﬁne an aerodynamic angle of sideslip βa as the angle between the
projections on the X Y plane of the x-axis and the relative velocity −Vr .

Angles β and βa usually refer to the velocity of the centre of mass, but can be

referred to the velocity of any speciﬁc point of the vehicle.

20.7 Position of the Center of Mass

The position of the center of mass is very important in determining the behavior of
the vehicle and must be computed, or at least assessed, at the design stage and then
experimentally determined. If the various components of the vehicle are designed
using CAD techniques, it is generally possible to have their mass and the positions of
their centers of mass among the outputs of the code. The position of the center of mass
of the vehicle can then be assessed from the results obtained for the components, but
this evaluation is generally approximate and at any rate is a long computation. Then
what is of interest is not the position of the center of mass of the empty vehicle, but
that of the vehicle in the various operating conditions (vehicle with all liquids, the
driver, a variable number of passengers and possibly luggage).

The longitudinal position of the center of mass can be obtained by simply weighing
the vehicle on a level road at the front and rear axles (Fig. 20.13a). If Fz1 and Fz2 are the
vertical forces measured at the two axles, the equilibrium equations for translations
in the z direction and for rotations about the y-axis can be written as:

If the center of mass does not lie in the symmetry plane, it is possible to compute
the transversal position of the center of mass by measuring the forces under the right
and left wheels.

It is more difﬁcult to determine the height of the center of mass. Once the lon-
gitudinal position is known (once a and b have been determined) it is possible to
measure again the forces on the ground after the front (or the rear) axle has been
raised from the ground (Fig. 20.13b).

Let the front axle be set on a platform with height h with respect to the platform
on which the rear axle is located. If the height of the center of mass hG is greater
than the radius under load of the wheels, the force F (cid:2)
measured at the front axle will
z1
be smaller than that measured on level road. It is then possible to write:

If the force at the rear axle is measured, it would be:

F (cid:2)
z1

= Fz1

− (cid:6)Fz .

F (cid:2)

To measure accurately the height of the center of mass, the wheels must be com-
pletely free (brakes released and gear in neutral), and the vehicle must be restrained
from rolling by chocks at one of the axles. Moreover, the suspensions must be locked
at a height corresponding to the load distribution on level road, and the tires must be
equally compressed.

This last condition can be obtained in an approximate way by increasing the
inﬂation pressure. It is then possible to take several measurements of (cid:6)Fz at different
values of tan (α) and to plot (cid:6)Fz versus tan (α). If the radii of the wheels are all
equal, such a curve is a straight line, whose slope

(20.10)

allows one to compute the height of the center of mass.

20.8 Mass Distribution Among the Various Bodies

In terms of dynamic behavior, vehicles are often modeled as a number of rigid
bodies with different inertial properties. The simplest way to model a vehicle is to
consider the body as a rigid body (sprung mass), to which a further rigid body is
added to model each rigid axle, and two rigid bodies for each axle with independent
suspension. This approach is approximate, since many vehicle elements (suspension
linkages, springs, shock absorbers) do not belong to any of these bodies. Half of the
mass of the elements located between two rigid bodies may be attributed to each one
of them, but this is an approximation, although usually an acceptable one.

There is no alternative either to computing or experimentally determining the mass
of the various components separately to evaluate the mass of the various subsystems.
For a ﬁrst approximation evaluation, the center of mass of a rigid axle can be assumed
to lie on the line connecting the centers of the wheels in the symmetry planes. The
center of mass of each independent suspension can be located at a distance from the
symmetry plane equal to half of the track of the relevant axle. Better estimations can
come from a detailed analysis of the drawings of the suspension.

20.8 Mass Distribution Among the Various Bodies

119

Once the positions of the centers of mass of the whole vehicle and of the suspen-
sions (unsprung masses) are known, it is straightforward to locate the center of mass
of the sprung mass.

More detailed models can be obtained from computer codes based on multibody
modelling. Not only do they allow us to take into account the various parts con-
stituting the vehicle in much greater detail (each element of the suspension can be
introduced separately, with its mass, moments of inertia and exact kinematics), but
their compliance can also be introduced using the ﬁnite element method (FEM).

20.9 Moments of Inertia

The computation of the moments of inertia of the vehicle and of its parts is a
complex operation, but if the design of the various components has been performed
using CAD, the approximate values of the moments of inertia are among the outputs
of the code.

6Often products of inertia are deﬁned as Jx y = −
Eq. (20.11).

(cid:18)

V x ydm, etc. and signs (−) are not included in

20 General Characteristics

and

Usually, the moments of inertia of interest are:

• the baricentric roll moment of inertia (about the x-axis) of the sprung mass JSx ,
• the baricentric pitch moment of inertia (about the y-axis) of the sprung mass JSy

• the baricentric yaw moment of inertia (about the z-axis) of the whole vehicle Jz.

The ﬁrst two are obviously referred to the center of mass of the sprung mass,

while the latter is referred to the center of mass of the whole vehicle.

Some empirical formulae for their computation from the mass of the vehicle are
often used. These usually yield the radius of gyration ρ instead of the corresponding
moment of inertia:

Ji = mρ2
i

,

i = x, y, z .

A ﬁrst rough approximation for the yaw radius of gyration is:

(20.15)

(20.16)

ρz =

for a medium size car are7:

2 passengers
4 passengers
0, 60 1, 10 1, 14
4 passengers + luggage 0, 56 1, 13 1, 18

Note also that the values for the sprung mass are referred to the total mass of the

vehicle. As a ﬁrst approximation, inertia products may be neglected.

Remark 20.1 The moments and products of inertia must be known with precision,
since they are important in assessing the performance of the vehicle, both for its han-
dling and its comfort. It is then important to measure them accurately once prototypes
are built.

The simplest way to measure the moments of inertia of any object is to suspend
it in such a way that it can rotate as a pendulum about an axis that is parallel to the
baricentric axis about which the moment of inertia must be measured (Fig. 20.14a).
If d is the distance between the center of mass and the suspension axis, the moment
of inertia about the latter is:

J = JG + md 2 .

By repeating the measurement three times with the object suspended about three
axes parallel to the x-, y- and z-axes, the three moments of inertia can be measured.
To measure the products of inertia, the measurements can be repeated measuring
the moments of inertia about three axes different from the previous ones. Since the
inertia tensor about the latter is

J(cid:2) = RT JR

(20.20)

where R is a known rotation matrix, it is possible to compute the values of the
elements of the unknown inertia tensor J from the three values of J(cid:2) computed in the
new test. The measurements of the moments of inertia are theoretically simple, but
it is not easy to actually perform them, particularly if precision is required.8

20 General Characteristics

It is possible to use test rigs based, for instance, on the multiﬁlar pendulum layout
(Fig. 20.14b9). The vehicle is suspended from it and the three moments of inertia can
be computed in a single test. The pendulum has three degrees of freedom and, once
it starts oscillating, the three moments of inertia can be obtained by analyzing the
time history of the oscillations.

Chapter 21
An Overview on Motor Vehicle
Aerodynamics

The forces and moments a vehicle receives from the surrounding air depend more
on the shape of the body than on the characteristics of the chassis. A detailed study
of motor vehicle aerodynamics is thus beyond the scope of a book dealing with the
automotive chassis.

However, aerodynamic forces and moments have a large inﬂuence on the longi-
tudinal performance of the vehicle, its handling and even its comfort, so it is not
possible to neglect them altogether.

Even if the goal of motor vehicle aerodynamics is often considered to be essentially
the reduction of aerodynamic drag, the scope and the applications of aerodynamics
in motor vehicle technology are much wider.

The following aspects are worth mentioning:

• reduction of aerodynamic drag,
• reduction of the side force and the yaw moment, which have an important inﬂuence

on stability and handling,

• reduction of aerodynamic noise, an important issue for acoustic comfort, and
• reduction of dirt deposited on the vehicle and above all on the windows and lights
when driving on a wet road, and in particular in mud or snow conditions. This
aspect, important for safety, can be extended to the creation of spray wakes that
can reduce visibility for other vehicles following or passing the vehicle under
study.

The provisions taken to obtain these goals are often different and sometimes
contradictory. A typical example is the trend toward more streamlined shapes that
allow us to reduce aerodynamic drag, but at the same time have a negative effect on
stability.

Another example is the mistaken assumption that a shape that reduces aerody-
namic drag also has the effect of reducing aerodynamic noise. The former is mainly
inﬂuenced by the shape of the rear part of the vehicle, while the latter is much inﬂu-
enced by the shape of the front and central part, primarily of the windshield strut
An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

(A-pillar). It is then possible that a change in shape aimed at reducing one of these
effects may have no inﬂuence, or sometimes even a negative inﬂuence, on the other
one.

At any rate, all aerodynamic effects increase sharply with speed, usually with the
square of the speed, and are almost negligible in slow vehicles. Moreover, they are
irrelevant in city driving.

Aerodynamic effects, on the contrary, become important at speeds higher than
60−70 km/h and dominate the scene above 120−140 km/h. Actually these ﬁgures
must be considered only as indications, since the relative importance of aerodynamic
effects and those linked with the mass of the vehicle depend on the ratio between the
cross section area and the mass of the vehicle. At about 90−100 km/h, for instance,
the aerodynamic forces acting on a large industrial vehicle are negligible when it
travels at full load, while they become important if it is empty.

Modern motor vehicle aerodynamics is quite different from aeronautic aerody-
namics, from which it derives, not only for its application ﬁelds but above all for
its numerical and experimental instruments and methods. The shapes of the objects
dealt with in aeronautics are dictated mostly by aerodynamics, and the aerodynamic
ﬁeld contains few or no zones in which the ﬂow separates from the body. On the
contrary, the shape of motor vehicles is determined mostly by considerations like the
possibility of locating passengers and luggage (or the payload in industrial vehicles),
aesthetic considerations imposed by style, or the need to cool the engine and other
devices like brakes. The blunt shapes that result from these considerations cause
large zones where the ﬂow separates and a large wake and vortices result.

The presence of the ground and of rotating wheels has a large inﬂuence on the
aerodynamic ﬁeld and makes its study much more difﬁcult than in the case of aero-
nautics, where the only interaction is that between a body and the surrounding air.

One of the few problems that are similar in aeronautical and motor vehicle aero-
dynamics is the study of devices like the wings of racing cars, but this is in any case
a specialized ﬁeld that has little to do with vehicle chassis design, and it will not be
dealt with here in detail.

Traditionally, the study of aerodynamic actions on motor vehicles is primarily
performed experimentally, and the wind tunnel
is its main tool. The typical wind
tunnel scenario is a sort of paradigm for interpreting aerodynamic phenomena, to the
point that usually the body is thought to be stationary and the air moving around it,
instead of assuming that the body moves through stationary air.

However, while in aeronautics the two viewpoints are coincident, in motor vehicle
aerodynamics they would be so only if, in the wind tunnel, the ground moved together
with the air instead of being stationary with respect to the vehicle. Strong practical
complications are encountered when attempting to allow the ground to move with
respect to the vehicle, and allowing the wheels to rotate. Usually, in wind tunnel
testing, the ground does not move, but its motion is simulated in an approximate
way.

Along with wind tunnel tests, it is possible to perform tests in actual conditions,
with vehicles suitably instrumented to take measurements of aerodynamic forces

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

125

while travelling on the road. Measurements of the pressure and the velocity of the
air at different points are usually taken.

Recently powerful computers able to simulate the aerodynamic ﬁeld numerically
have became available. Numerical aerodynamic simulation is extremely demanding
in terms of computational power and time, but it allows us to predict, with increasing
accuracy, the aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle before building a prototype
or a full scale model (note that reduced scale models, often used in aeronautics, are
seldom used in vehicular technology).

There is, however, a large difference between aeronautical and vehicular aero-
dynamics from this viewpoint as well. Nowadays, numerical aerodynamics is able
to predict very accurately the aerodynamic properties of streamlined bodies, even if
wind tunnel tests are needed to obtain an experimental conﬁrmation. The possibil-
ity of performing extensive virtual experimentation on mathematical models greatly
reduces the number of experimental tests to be performed.

Around blunt bodies, on the other hand, it is very difﬁcult to simulate the aero-
dynamic ﬁeld accurately, given their large detached zones and wake. Above all, it
is difﬁcult to compute where the streamlines separate from the body. The impact of
numerical aerodynamics is much smaller in motor vehicle design than has been in
aeronautics.

As said, the aim of this chapter is not to delve into details of vehicular aerody-
namics, but only to introduce those aspects that inﬂuence the design of the chassis.
While the study of the mechanisms that generate aerodynamic forces and moments
inﬂuencing the longitudinal and handling performance of the vehicle will be dealt
with in detail, those causing aerodynamic noise or the deposition of dirt on win-
dows and lights will be overlooked. In particular, those unstationary phenomena,
like the generation of vortices that are very important in aerodynamic noise, will not
be studied.

21.1 Aerodynamic Forces and Moments

In aeronautics, the aerodynamic force acting on the aircraft is usually decomposed
in the direction of the axes of a reference frame Gx (cid:2)(cid:2) y(cid:2)(cid:2)z(cid:2)(cid:2), usually referred to as
the wind axes system , centered in the mass center G, with the x (cid:2)(cid:2)-axis directed as
the velocity of the vehicle with respect to air −Vr and the z(cid:2)(cid:2)-axis contained in the
symmetry plane.

The components of the aerodynamic forces in the Gx (cid:2)(cid:2) y(cid:2)(cid:2)z(cid:2)(cid:2) frame are referred to
as drag D, side force S and lift L. The aerodynamic moment is usually decomposed
along the vehicle-ﬁxed axes Gx yz.

In the case of motor vehicles, both the aerodynamic force and moment are usually
decomposed with reference to the frame x yz: The components of the aerodynamic
force are referred to as longitudinal Fxa , lateral Fya and normal Fza forces while those
of the moment are the rolling Mxa , pitching Mya and yawing Mza moments.

126

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

Fig. 21.1 Reference frame often used to express aerodynamic forces in wind tunnel tests

In the present text, aerodynamic forces will always be referred to frame x yz,
which is centred in the centre of mass of the vehicle. However, in wind tunnel testing
the exact position of the centre of mass is usually unknown and the forces are referred
to a frame which is immediately identiﬁed.

Moreover, the position of the centre of mass of the vehicle depends also on the
loading, while aerodynamic forces are often assumed to be independent of it, although
a change of the load of the vehicle can affect its attitude on the road and hence the
value of aerodynamic forces and moments.

The frame often used to express forces and moments for wind tunnel tests is a
frame centred in a point on the symmetry plane and on the ground, located at mid-
wheelbase, with the x (cid:2)-axis lying on the ground in the plane of symmetry of the
vehicle and the y(cid:2)-axis lying also on the ground (Fig. 21.1). Since the resultant air
velocity Vr lies in a horizontal plane, angle α is the aerodynamic angle of attack.
From the deﬁnition of the x axis, it is a small angle and is often assumed to be equal
to zero.

Remark 21.1 From the deﬁnitions here used for the reference frames it follows that
α is positive when the x-axis points downwards.

The forces and moments expressed in the x yz frame can be computed from those
y and

dynamic force, which is usually applied to the centre of mass of the vehicle, and an
aerodynamic moment. By decomposing the force and the moment in Gx yz frame, it

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

At standstill, the only force exerted by air is the aerostatic force, acting in the
vertical direction. It is equal to the weight of the displaced ﬂuid. It reaches non-
negligible values only for very light and large bodies and it is completely neglected
in aerodynamics.

If air were an inviscid ﬂuid, i.e., if its viscosity were nil, no tangential forces could
act on the surface of the body; it can be demonstrated that in this case no force could
be exchanged between the body and the ﬂuid, apart from aerostatic forces, at any
relative speed since the resultant of the pressure distribution always vanishes. This
result, the work of D’Alembert, was formulated in 17441 and again in 1768.2 It has
since been known as the D’Alembert Paradox.

In the case of a ﬂuid with no viscosity, the pressure p and the velocity V can be

linked to each other by the Bernoulli equation

where p0 and V0 are the values of the ambient pressure and of the velocity far enough

is the total pressure.

The values of the ambient pressure, together with those of the density, temperature,
and kinematic viscosity at altitudes of interest in road vehicle technology, are reported
in Table 21.1 from the ICAO standard atmosphere .

The density at temperatures and pressures different from pa and Ta in standard

conditions can be computed as

where temperatures are absolute.

The dynamic pressure is extremely low, when compared to the ambient pressure:
consider, for instance, a vehicle moving in air at the temperature and pressure equal
to those indicated in Table 21.1 at sea level, at a speed of 30 m/s (108 km/h). The

pressure is about 101 kPa, while the dynamic pressure is 0.55 kPa, corresponding to
0.5% of pressure.

The variations of pressure due to velocity variations are thus quite small with
respect to atmospheric pressure; however, such small pressure changes, acting on
surfaces of some square meters, yield non-negligible, and sometimes large, aerody-
namic forces.

Note that the Bernoulli equation, which holds along any streamline, was written
without the gravitational term, the one linked with aerostatic forces. It states simply
that the total energy is conserved along any streamline.

An example of the D’Alembert Paradox is shown in Fig. 21.2, where the cross
section of a cylinder of inﬁnite length, whose axis is perpendicular to the direction
of the velocity Vr of the ﬂuid, is represented. The streamlines open around the body
and the local velocity of the ﬂuid increases on its sides, leading to a decrease of
pressure as described by the Bernoulli Equation. On the front of the body there is a
point (actually in the case of the cylinder it is a line) which divides the part of the
ﬂow which goes “above” the body from that going “below” it. At this point, known
as the stagnation point , the velocity of the ﬂuid reduces to zero and the pressure
reaches its maximum, equal to the total pressure.

Since there is no viscosity, no energy is dissipated, and when the ﬂuid slows down
again, after reaching the maximum velocity at the point where the width of the body
is maximum, the pressure is fully recovered: The pressure distribution is symmetrical
and no net force is exchanged between the ﬂuid and the body. This holds for any
possible shape, provided that the viscosity is exactly nil.

No ﬂuid actually has zero viscosity and the Paradox is not applicable to any real
ﬂuid. Viscosity has a twofold effect: It causes tangential forces creating so-called
friction drag, and it modiﬁes the pressure distribution, whose resultant is no longer
equal to zero. The latter effect, which for ﬂuids with low viscosity is generally more
important than the former, generates the lift, the side force and the pressure drag.

to the ﬂow. This is a case of a ﬂuid with no viscosity

Fig. 21.3 Boundary layer: Velocity distribution in direction perpendicular to the surface. The
separation point is also represented

The direct effects of viscosity (i.e. the tangential forces) can usually be neglected,
while the modiﬁcations of the aerodynamic ﬁeld must be accounted for.

Owing to viscosity, the layer of ﬂuid in immediate contact with the surface tends
to adhere to it, i.e. its relative velocity vanishes, and the body is surrounded by a
zone where there are strong velocity gradients. This zone is usually referred to as
the “boundary layer” (Fig. 21.3) and all viscous effects are concentrated in it. The
viscosity of the ﬂuid outside the boundary layer is usually neglected and the Bernoulli
equation can be used in this region.

Remark 21.2 The thickness of the boundary layer increases as the ﬂuid in it loses
energy owing to viscosity and slows down. If the ﬂuid outside the boundary layer
increases its velocity, a negative pressure gradient along the separation line between

21.1 Aerodynamic Forces and Moments

131

the external ﬂow and the boundary layer is created, and this decrease of pressure in
a way boosts the ﬂow within the boundary layer ﬁghting its tendency to slow down.
On the contrary, if the outer ﬂow slows down, the pressure gradient is positive and
the airﬂow in the boundary layer is hampered.

At any rate, at a certain point the ﬂow in the boundary layer can stop and a zone
of stagnant air can form in the vicinity of the body: The ﬂow then separates from the
surface, possibly starting the formation of a wake.

If the velocity distribution outside the boundary layer were known, the pressure
distribution at the interface between the boundary layer and the external ﬂuid could
be computed. Provided that the boundary layer is very thin, and this is the case except
where the ﬂow is detached from the surface, the pressure on the surface of the body
can be assumed to be equal to that occurring at the outer surface of the boundary layer,
and then the aerodynamic forces and moments can be computed by integrating the
pressure distribution. While this can be applied to computing the lift of streamlined
objects, for blunt bodies, like the ones studied by road vehicle aerodynamics, and
for drag, few results can be obtained along these lines.

To generalize the results obtained by experimental testing, performed mainly in

wind tunnels, the aerodynamic force F and moment M are expressed as

F = 1
2

ρVr

2 SC f ,

M = 1

ρVr

(21.11)

where forces and moments are assumed to be proportional to the dynamic pressure
of the free current

to a reference surface S (in the expression of the moment a reference length l is
also present) and to nondimensional coefﬁcients C f and Cm to be experimentally
determined.

Such coefﬁcients depend on the geometry and position of the body, and on two

non-dimensional parameters, the Reynolds number

and the Mach number

where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid (see Table 21.1) and Vs is the velocity
of sound in the ﬂuid.

The former is a parameter indicating the relative importance of the inertial and
viscous effects in determining aerodynamic forces. If its value is low, the latter are
of great importance, while if it is high aerodynamic forces are primarily due to the
inertia of the ﬂuid. In this case (for vehicles, if Re > 3,000,000), the dependence

132

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

of the aerodynamic coefﬁcients on the Reynolds number is very low and can be
neglected. This is usually the case for road vehicles, at least for speeds in excess of
30−40 km/h.

If, on the contrary, the Reynolds number is low, aerodynamic forces and moments
are essentially due to viscosity. In this case, their dependence on the velocity V should
be linear rather than quadratic or, to use Eqs. (21.11), the aerodynamic coefﬁcients
should be considered as dependent on the speed, increasing with decreasing speed.
The Mach number is the ratio between the airspeed and the speed of sound.4
When its value is low, the ﬂuid can be considered as incompressible; aerodynamic
coefﬁcients are then independent of speed. Approaching the speed of sound (Ma ∼
1), the compressibility of the ﬂuid can no longer be neglected and aerodynamic
drag increases sharply. It is commonly thought that the Mach number is irrelevant
in automotive aerodynamics, since the speeds road vehicles may reach, with the
exception of some vehicles built to set speed records, lead to Mach numbers low
enough to have practically no inﬂuence on aerodynamic coefﬁcients. Actually this
is true for streamlined bodies, for which the inﬂuence of Mach number is negligible
for values up to 0.5−0.6 (speeds up to 600−700 km/h), while for blunt bodies ﬂuid
compressibility starts to play a role at a lower speed, even for Mach numbers slightly
larger than 0.2 (V = 70 m/s = 250 km/h). As a consequence, the effects of the Mach
number start to be felt at speeds that can be reached by racing cars. It is important to
note that, owing to this effect of the Mach number, it is not possible to perform tests
on reduced scale models by increasing the speed to increase the Reynolds number.
The reference surface S and length l are arbitrary, to the point that in some cases
a surface not existing physically, like a power 2/3 of the displacement for airships,
is used. These references simply express the dependence of aerodynamic forces on
the square of the dimensions of the body and that of the moments on their cube. It
is, however, clear that the numerical values of the coefﬁcients depend on the choice
of S and l, which must be clearly deﬁned. In the case of road vehicles, the surface is
that of the cross section, with some uncertainty about whether the frontal projected
area or that of the maximum cross section has been used (Fig. 21.4).

The mentioned SAE recommendation states that the frontal projected area, which
should include the tires and the underbody parts, must be used. The reference surface
is usually determined by using optical methods, by projecting a light beam on a
screen, moving it to follow the outer shape of the vehicle. A simple but sometimes
imprecise way of obtaining its value is

S = ψbh ,

(21.12)

where the value of coefﬁcient ψ is about 0.81 and b and h are the width and the height
of the vehicle. The area of the frontal area of various cars is reported as a function
of their mass in Fig. 21.4. The points are well aligned on the straight line

S = 1.18 + 0.00056 m ,

The reference length l is usually the wheelbase, but in the expression of moment

Mx the track t is often used.

The aerodynamic coefﬁcients used in motor vehicle aerodynamics are those of the
forces and moments decomposed along the vehicle axis system x yz: The longitudinal
force coefﬁcient Cx , the side force coefﬁcient C y, the normal force coefﬁcient Cz, the
rolling moment coefﬁcient C Mx , the pitching moment coefﬁcient C My , the yawing
moment coefﬁcient C Mz .

21.2 Aerodynamic Field Around a Vehicle

Consider a saloon car like the one sketched in Fig. 21.5. As usual in aerodynamics,
assume a “wind tunnel” situation, i.e., consider the vehicle as stationary while the
air ﬂows around it.

The stream has a stagnation point at A, where the ﬂow divides below and above
the vehicle; in the vicinity of A the pressure takes the value ptot . In the vicinity of
B, the pressure takes values lower than the total pressure and even lower than the
ambient pressure p0, as the velocity increases, as shown in Fig. 21.6b, where the
pressure distribution is reported in terms of pressure coefﬁcient

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

Fig. 21.5 Streamlines about a passenger vehicle in the symmetry plane

Note that the pressure coefﬁcient is negative if the pressure is lower than the

ambient pressure.
Remark 21.3 As already stated, pressure variations p − p0 are extremely small when
compared to atmospheric pressure; however, their small value must not lead to the
conclusion that aerodynamic forces are small: An overpressure equal to 0.5% of
atmospheric pressure, like the one present at the stagnation point at 100 km/h acting
on a surface of 1 m2, yields a force of 500 N.

After point C, located between B and the lower edge of the windshield, the ﬂow
detaches from the surface, to attach again at point D on the windshield. A separation
bubble is formed between points C and D. The pressure in such a turbulent zone is
fairly high, and it is reasonable to locate the intakes for ventilation of the passenger
compartment there (Fig. 21.6). The separation bubble can be reduced by reducing
the inclination of the windshield, which can be done only up to a limit since it may
reduce visibility, or by increasing the transversal curvature of the windshield and
of the hood. A curved windshield is effective in reducing drag but costs, and also
weighs, more than a simple, ﬂat one.

On the roof the pressure is again low, with a distribution that depends on its shape
and curvature. At the end of the roof, the ﬂow must slow down and the pressure
should rise. In these conditions, the ﬂow easily detaches and any surface irregularity
can trigger formation of the wake.

In Fig. 21.5a, the separation point has been located at the rear edge of the roof.
There are cases in which the ﬂow attaches again to the back of the trunk, giving way
to a second separation bubble (Fig. 21.5b).

21.2 Aerodynamic Field Around a Vehicle

135

Fig. 21.6 a Separation bubble on the windscreen of a car. b Pressure distribution on the symmetry
plane of a saloon car and in the wake

In the case of fastback cars with a sufﬁciently sloping back, the ﬂow can remain
attached up to the end of the body, giving way to a very small wake (Fig. 21.5c).
The two situations are shown in the pictures of Fig. 21.7, obtained by visualizing the
streamlines using smoke in a wind tunnel test.

The streamlines shown in Fig. 21.5 describe the situation occurring in the plane
of symmetry. Outside this plane, the ﬂow is no longer two-dimensional and tends to
surround the vehicle at the sides as well.

This effect is generally beneﬁcial and must be encouraged, as it tends to reduce
all aerodynamic forces, giving a suitable curvature in the transverse direction to all
surfaces. As already stated, point C can be moved further back by allowing the air
to ﬂow to the sides of the hood by lowering the fenders and giving them a curved
shape; point D can be lowered by using a curved windshield. This results in a reduced
separation bubble (Fig. 21.6).

The tridimensional ﬂow on the back of the vehicle can cause vortices, as shown by
tests on slanted blocks (Fig. 21.8). If angle α in the ﬁgure is lower than a critical value
(about 62◦), the ﬂow separates abruptly, while for higher values the ﬂow becomes
strongly tri-dimensional and the streamlines which ﬂow along the sides wind up
in two large vortices while those ﬂowing on the roof are deﬂected downwards and
follow the tail of the vehicle. The ﬂow in the symmetry plane, which is of the type
shown in Fig. 21.9, is similar to that shown in Fig. 21.5c.

The wake is smaller, but this does not mean that the drag is lower: The pressure
in the vortices is low, as is that on the centre of the tail since the ﬂow is very fast
in that zone: The overall pressure behind the vehicle can be even lower than that
characterizing a large wake due to a small angle α.

The ﬂow under the vehicle can be quite complicated and depends on many factors
like the distance between vehicle and ground and the presence of a fairing under the
body. Wind tunnel simulations can be misleading since in actual use the ground is
stationary with respect to the air, at least if there is no wind, and not with respect to
the vehicle, as occurs in wind tunnels.

In actual use, starting from the stagnation point A the boundary layer gradually
thickens (Fig. 21.10). Outside the boundary layer, the velocity of the ﬂow is different

from that of the free stream, i.e., the ﬂow is no longer at rest with respect to the
ground, and from point G a second boundary layer appears on the ground as well.

Depending on the distance between the vehicle and the ground, the two boundary
layers can meet in H or can remain separated. In the ﬁrst case the ﬂow is blocked and
the air under the vehicle tends to move with it, giving way to another boundary layer
starting from L. Between H and L a vortex may result. In the second case, the ﬂow
between the vehicle and the ground decreases aerodynamic lift, because of both the
decreased size of the wake (Fig. 21.11) and the lower energy dissipation; if it is fast
enough it causes a negative lift. The ﬂow below the vehicle reduces the drag also,
because the pressure in the wake is increased.

ground and rough; b Streamlined bottom, at a greater distance from the ground

Fig. 21.12 Effect of
streamlining the bottom of
the vehicle on the drag
coefﬁcient for two vehicles, I
and II

All improvements which facilitate the ﬂow under the vehicle have these effects:
Either the distance between vehicle and ground is increased or the bottom is given
a curved shape, in the longitudinal or transverse direction, or the bottom is supplied
with a smooth fairing covering the mechanical elements that are usually in the airﬂow.
The last device may reduce the drag up to about 10−15% as shown in Fig. 21.12,
but is seldom used in passenger cars as it is more difﬁcult to reach the mechanical
elements, making maintenance more costly.

These considerations cannot be generalized since any change of shape aimed at
modifying the aerodynamic ﬁeld at one point has an inﬂuence on the whole aerody-
namic ﬁeld, with effects that are difﬁcult to predict.

Two effects can modify the airﬂow around the vehicle and make it more compli-

cated: Wheel rotation and the presence of internal ﬂows.

21.2 Aerodynamic Field Around a Vehicle

139

Fig. 21.13 Streamlines, pressures and aerodynamic force acting on a wheel, modelled as a rotating
cylinder, far from the ground (a) and in contact with it (b)

Consider a cylinder rotating and moving in directions consistent with those of a
rolling wheel (Fig. 21.13a). It generates a drag and a lift (the Magnus effect)5 which
is directed downwards. If the wheel is in contact with the ground, however, the
streamlines are completely changed by the presence of the latter and the lift becomes
positive. The wake is larger and the drag coefﬁcient increases; both the size of the
ﬁrst and the value of the second depend on the speed (Fig. 21.13b).

There is also an increase in drag owing to the larger wake, whose size depends
also on the speed. The value of coefﬁcient Cx of a rolling wheel, referred to the area
of the cross section of the wheels, is plotted against the speed in Fig. 21.14.

As shown in the ﬁgure, the aerodynamic drag of a wheel increases if the wheel
rolls with a sideslip angle measured with reference to the relative velocity of the air.
In the case of the isolated wheel, this means that the drag depends on the sideslip
angle of the wheel, while in normal conditions the ﬂow is not parallel to the symmetry
plane of the wheel even if the sideslip of the latter is zero, since the ﬂow under the
vehicle is deﬂected sideways. This effect is, in general, larger for front wheels and
causes an increase in their aerodynamic drag. Streamlining the wheels in such a way
to reduce drag has the limitation that the shape of the hubs must be studied so as to
guarantee an appropriate cooling of the brakes.

5A cylinder rotating with its axis perpendicular to the stream entrains, owing to viscosity, a certain
quantity of air in rotation. On one side, the rotation velocity adds to the velocity of the stream; on
the opposite side it subtracts. Where the velocity is higher the pressure is lower, with the effect on
the other side. This pressure difference produces a force perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder
and to the direction of motion. This effect is usually referred to as the Magnus effect.

140

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

Fig. 21.14 Drag coefﬁcient of a rolling wheel. α is the sideslip angle

Since the drag coefﬁcient of a rolling wheel exposed to the airﬂow is about 0.45,
it would seem that there is an advantage in inserting the wheels within the body only
if the drag coefﬁcient of the vehicle is lower than that value. However, all vehicles
except formula racing cars have covered wheels for reasons different from drag
reduction. Uncovered wheels are present in racing cars only when rules explicitly
dictate. In Formula 1 racers, up to 45% of the aerodynamic drag can be ascribed to
the wheels.

A sketch of the streamlines around a partially covered wheel is shown in Fig. 21.15,
together with a plot of coefﬁcients Cx and Cz versus the ratio h/D between the amount
of wheel covered and its diameter. The curves are experimental and, particularly as
related to Cz not very reliable owing to the method used to simulate the presence of
the ground, but the results are at least qualitatively signiﬁcant.

The advantage of covering the wheel, without exceeding a value h/D = 0.5−0.7,
is clear. The values of Cx are generally very high, particularly if compared with those
of an isolated wheel, and the increase in drag when the wheel is largely covered can
be explained by viscous effects within the fender.

Another reason for the deviation of the aerodynamic ﬁeld from that shown in
Fig. 21.5 is the presence of internal ﬂows. There are usually two separate ﬂows inside
the vehicle: A cooling ﬂow in the engine compartment, and a ﬂow in the passenger
compartment; other internal ﬂows of lesser importance are those aimed at cooling
mechanical devices such as brakes or the oil radiator, if it is located separately from
the main radiator, etc.

The second ﬂow is of lesser importance: If the intake is set at the base of the
windshield and the outlet is in a zone in the wake, the result can be that of reducing
the drag slightly, as this conﬁguration reduces the pressure in the separation bubble
and increases that in the wake.

A larger amount of air is needed for engine cooling. A good solution would be to
use a radiator of the type common in water-cooled aircraft piston engines, in which a
diffuser slows down the ﬂow that is driven through the heat exchanger before being
accelerated again in a converging duct (Fig. 21.16a). In motor vehicles, a fan allowing
cooling with the vehicle stationary must also be provided. The diffuser should be
long enough to allow the ﬂow to be slowed down without separation (a slope of about
7◦ has been found to be a practical maximum) and the fan should operate only at
speeds lower than those for which the system has been designed.

In practice, this solution cannot be used, at least on normal vehicles: A system
of this type would be too long to be accommodated in the hood; instead there is a
short diffuser whose opening is too large to allow a good attached ﬂow, followed by
a radiator. The ﬂow then goes directly into the engine compartment without further
guidance. The internal ﬂow then mixes with the ﬂow passing under the vehicle in
a very disordered way. This situation is sketched in Fig. 21.16b. The complexities
needed for obtaining a well guided ﬂow, separated from the external ﬂow, are con-
sidered not worth the added cost and weight and the difﬁculties they would add to
maintenance operations in the engine compartment.

The presence of the internal ﬂow in the engine compartment has a non-negligible
inﬂuence on drag, lift, pitching moment and, although to a lesser extent, yawing
moment. It can account for about 13–20% of the total drag; the increase in lift
(generally positive, i.e. upwards) is even larger. The effect on moments is to move
forward both lift (pitching moment) and side force (yawing moment). As will be
seen later, both effects are detrimental to the overall behavior of the vehicle.

Aerodynamic testing should always be performed on models which reproduce
the inside of the engine compartment as well or, better, on the actual vehicle, with

open air intakes. Since the engine temperature affects the internal ﬂow, aerodynamic
testing should be done with the engine at running temperature.

21.3 Aerodynamic Drag

As already stated, aerodynamic drag is the component of the aerodynamic force
acting in the direction of the relative velocity, and thus the force that opposes the
motion of the body in the ﬂuid. If the relative velocity is conﬁned to the symmetry
plane (motion with no sideslip, and no lateral wind) the difference between drag and
force Fx is quite small; this is due to the fact that the angle between the x-axis and
the plane of the road is small, and that the aerodynamic efﬁciency, that is, the ratio
between lift and drag, of motor vehicles is very low, if not equal to zero. In the case
of road vehicles, the two are sometimes confused and force Fx is referred to as drag.

Remark 21.4 In many cases, drag is considered positive when directed backwards,
which is inconsistent with the general conventions on forces.

Aerodynamic drag can be considered as the sum of three terms: Friction drag,
shape drag and induced drag. Coefﬁcient Cx can be similarly considered as the sum
of the three corresponding terms

Cx = Cxa

+ Cx f

+ Cxi

.

(21.16)

While in aeronautics this subdivision is practically important, since the three
terms can be computed separately in the various ﬂight conditions, in the case of
motor vehicles they cannot actually be separated. To consider them one by one is
important only insofar as it allows one to understand how the various components
of the drag originate.

21.3 Aerodynamic Drag

21.3.1 Friction Drag

Friction drag is the resultant of the tangential forces acting on the surface
(cid:6)

(cid:3)tt × (cid:3)id S .

S

Since it is practically impossible to measure the friction drag on a body with com-
plex geometry, reference is usually made to ﬂat plates, where the only drag present
is friction drag. Friction drag coefﬁcient C f , referring to the “wet” surface, i.e., to
the surface exposed to the ﬂuid, is plotted versus the Reynolds number, computed
with reference to the length of the plate, as shown in Fig. 21.17.

The two straight lines (in the logarithmic plot) refer to a laminar and a turbulent

ﬂow in the boundary layer. They are approximated by the empirical relationships

C f = 1.328√
Re

, or C f = 0.074
Re

√

,

(21.17)

respectively.

The ﬂow is laminar if it is free from vorticity and there is no mixing between
adjacent streamlines. The vortices which are present in a turbulent boundary layer
are very small, but cause a mixing and a strong energy transfer within the layer. If
the ﬂuid is free from vorticity when it enters into contact with the plate, a laminar
ﬂow is maintained up to values of the Reynolds number of about 500,000, provided
that surface irregularities do not trigger turbulence. If the Reynolds number is higher,
at least a part of the plate experiences a turbulent ﬂow; the transition is shown in
Fig. 21.17, occurring where the local Reynolds number, computed with the distance
from the leading edge, reaches a value of 500,000.

In the case of streamlined bodies, it is expedient to maintain a laminar boundary
layer as long as possible to reduce friction drag. However, in the case of blunt bodies,
it often happens that a laminar boundary layer results in higher drag than a turbulent

one. This is due to the fact that in a laminar layer the ﬂuid which is in immediate
contact with the surface receives less energy from adjacent layers and tends to slow
down more quickly. Particularly in cases where the ﬂow outside the boundary layer
slows down and the pressure subsequently increases, a thickening of the boundary
layer which eventually results in the detachment of the ﬂow and the formation of a
wake takes place. This eventually occurs in the case of the turbulent layer as well, but
the energy exchanges due to ﬂuid mixing within the boundary layer help to maintain
the ﬂow attached to the surface for a longer distance.

The drag coefﬁcient of a sphere is plotted as a function of the Reynolds number
in Fig. 21.18, together with a sketch of the streamlines for the cases of laminar and
turbulent ﬂow.

The ﬂow around motor vehicles is always turbulent, owing to the presence of
vortices in the air near the ground due to other vehicles and, above all, if there
is wind, to the ground and ﬁxed obstacles. Vehicles actually move in what can be
deﬁned as the boundary layer of the Earth’s surface. Even if it were expedient to keep
the boundary layer laminar, it would be very difﬁcult to do so. The percentage of
the drag due to friction is usually low, on the order of 10% of the total aerodynamic
drag.

21.3.2 Induced Drag

Induced drag is that portion of aerodynamic drag that is linked with the generation
of lift. In aeronautics, it plays the same role that rolling resistance plays in motor
vehicle dynamics: It is responsible for the energy that is dissipated to support the
vehicle during motion.

21.3 Aerodynamic Drag

145

Fig. 21.19 Vorticity in a lifting wing. a Bound vortex; b trailing vortices

In the case of road vehicles, aerodynamic lift is not needed, and is actually a
nuisance. The induced drag should be reduced to a minimum by reducing lift. An
exception is the negative lift produced by aerodynamic devices aimed at increasing
the normal force holding the vehicle to the ground: In this case, induced aerodynamic
drag adds to increased rolling resistance.

To understand the origin of induced drag, reference can be made to the theory
of high aspect ratio (the ratio between the span and the chord) wings attributed
to Prandtl. This theory can be applied in many cases to the wings which produce
negative lift in racing cars. The lift of a wing is directly linked with a difference of
ﬂuid velocity between the upper and the lower surface of the wing, which causes a
difference of pressure and ultimately a lift force. The difference of velocity can be
thought as a vortex superimposed on the uniform airﬂow (Fig. 21.19a).

If the wing had an inﬁnite span, all sections would experience a two-dimensio-
nal ﬂow: No induced drag is produced. In the case of an actual ﬁnite-span wing, the
vortex cannot vanish at the tips of the wing and its core is simply deﬂected backwards,
creating a wake of vortices. To understand intuitively why this vorticity is generated,
it must be considered that air under the wing, whose pressure has increased, tend
to move toward the tip, where it goes around the end of the wing toward the upper
surface, where pressure is lower. The vortex then winds around the tip edge of the
wing, a motion that remains even after the wing has passed (or the stream ﬂows
beyond the wing, in the wing tunnel model, where the wing is stationary and the air
ﬂows around it), producing a trailing vortex.

A bound vortex plus the two trailing vortices at its end constitute a horseshoe
vortex, like those shown in Fig. 21.19b. Since the vorticity is not constant along the
wing, a set of such vortices is produced and the trailing vortices depart at different
points along the wing. Actually, rather than of a set of vortices, we should speak of
a distribution of vortices.

The energy dissipation needed for the creation of the trailing vortices explains the
presence of the induced drag. Any device which reduces trailing vortices, such as tip
plates or modiﬁed wing tips, is effective in reducing induced drag. Trailing vortices
are sometimes easily visible at the tips of the wings of racing cars.

146

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

From the theory of high aspect ratio wings it can be deduced that induced drag
is proportional to the square of the lift or, which is equivalent, that the induced drag
coefﬁcient is proportional to the square of the lift coefﬁcient. However, in the case
of low aspect ratio wings and, above all, blunt bodies, this proportionality no longer
holds. The presence of the ground can also modify the pattern of vortices. It has been
suggested in the case of road vehicles that it is not possible to deﬁne an induced drag
and that the term vortex drag is preferable.6 Whatever the case, the vortices which
are created behind a vehicle (Fig. 21.9) are linked with the generation of lift, and a
reduction of lift always causes a reduction of the overall aerodynamic drag.

21.3.3 Shape Drag

Shape drag is what remains of the drag if the contributions due to friction and induced
drag are removed and, in the case of road vehicles, it is mainly due to the wake .
The pressure in the wake is low and fairly constant and hence shape drag can be
approximately evaluated as the product of the wake pressure by the projection on yz
plane of the area exposed to it: The shape of the part of the vehicle in the wake has
little importance. This statement must not be misunderstood: The shape of the tail of
the vehicle is important to assess where the wake starts, but once this issue is solved,
only the extension of the wake matters.

Remark 21.5 Any geometrical irregularity can precipitate the detachment of the ﬂow
and the wake formation, particularly if it is located in a zone in which the ﬂow slows
down.

21.3.4 Aerodynamic Drag Reduction: Passenger Vehicles

Since the beginning of motor vehicle technology, several attempts aimed at reducing
aerodynamic drag have been made. Shapes developed for aircraft and for airships
have been adopted, often in a naive way, as the attempt to streamline the body was
often offset by mechanical parts completely exposed to the wind.

The shape which proved to produce the lowest ratio between aerodynamic drag
and volume was the straight, circular, slender body with a diameter to length ratio
equal to about 0.3. For a Reynolds number of about 107, its drag coefﬁcient is of 0.05.
However, it is difﬁcult to produce a suitable car body from this speciﬁcation and it is,
moreover, optimal only if the vehicle’s motion takes place far from the ground. The
presence of the latter causes the ﬂow to change substantially (Fig. 21.20a) and the

dimensional bodies with blunt ends, in Aerodynamic drag mechanism of bluff bodies and vehicles,

value of Cx to be far higher, up to values of about 0.15 at distances from the ground
typical of motor vehicles.

If the vehicle’s distance from the ground were zero, the best shape would be half
of a slender body, a consideration which seems to have inspired several designs of
the past. However, the distance of the vehicle from the ground cannot be zero, and
this solution leads to quite high values of the drag.

If the axis of the slender body is curved, a lower resistance to motion near the
ground results (Fig. 21.20b), with an optimum value of the camber ratio a/l existing
for each value of the distance from the ground. The optimum value of the camber
ratio for a nondimensional ground clearance h/D = 0.1 is about 10%. However,
the difﬁculties in adapting a slender body to a vehicle and housing the mechanical
components and the wheels in it remain.

The results obtained by Lay in 1933 through a series of wind tunnel tests per-
formed on modular models are still interesting. His basic shapes were a ﬂat plate
perpendicular to the current (he found a value of Cx larger than 1.2), a slender body
(whose Cx was measured at 0.08), a rectangular box (Cx = 0.86), and a vehicle from
his era (Cx = 0.6).

He then discovered that a slight rounding of the corners of the box resulted in a
decrease of Cx to 0.46. By ﬁtting different front and rear parts to the vehicle model, he
saw not only that by shaping both parts suitably could aerodynamic drag be reduced,
but also that the shaping of the rear part is more important than that of the front part.
Also, using the shapes tested by Lay, it is necessary to accept a very long vehicle to
obtain low drag.

Ten years earlier, in 1923, Jaray obtained a patent in Germany for a car body
made by a rectangular cambered stub wing with a slender body superimposed on
it (Fig. 21.21a). This approach, named the J-shape, allowed the wheels and other

mechanical components to be housed easily, but the problems related to the length
of the vehicle, if a sufﬁcient height for the passengers in the rear seats was required,
were not solved. The centre line of the body was also quite curved, resulting in
non-negligible lift and induced drag. However, the J-shape can be easily identiﬁed in
many vehicles beginning in the 1950s, like the Lancia Stratos, Citroen DS and many
coupé built by Porsche.

In 1937, a new approach was patented almost simultaneously by Kamm and
by Koënig and Fachsenfeld Reinhard. From the observation that to obtain optimum
height in the back of the J-shape without a very long vehicle, a shape which is prone
to produce a large wake is obtained, and that the shape of the part of the vehicle in
the wake has little signiﬁcance, they suggested that the long streamlined tail of the
J-shape could be truncated, following line KK of Fig. 21.21b. The result is shown in
Fig. 21.21c, from the original patent.7

Truncation does not affect shape drag, if the part cut off was already in the wake,
and likely reduces lift and induced drag. This statement is a rough approximation,
since any change in a part of the vehicle changes the entire aerodynamic ﬁeld, but the
use of the K-shape allowed designers to reduce the drag of many passenger vehicles.
Many cars of the 1970s had essentially a K-shape, like the Citroen GS and CX,
Lancia Beta and Gamma, Alfa Romeo Alfasud, Rover 3 liters and many others.

The aerodynamic evolution of passenger vehicles, in terms of the Cx coefﬁ-
cient, is summarized in Fig. 21.22: The three hatched zones refer to plots obtained

Fig. 21.22 Experimental values of Cx for passenger vehicles versus the year of construction

by different Authors: Gilhaus and Hoffmann8 refer to cars of different types,
Morelli et al. 9 report on the drag of cars with a sound aerodynamic shape, many
of which were built following the J- or K-shape, while the data reported by Sci-
bor Ryilski10 are related to a larger sample containing cars of all types. There is
no contradiction between them: While the best vehicles showed a constant progress
towards low drag, the availability of more powerful engines and the low cost of energy
caused a decrease in the movement towards better aerodynamics in the ﬁfties, with
an average increase in the drag of cars.

Remark 21.6 Actually, what really matters is not the value of coefﬁcient Cx , but the
value of product SCx : to reduce drag it is possible to search for a low value of the
x-force coefﬁcient or for a shape with low cross sectional area.

Any device aimed at reducing the value of Cx that causes an increase of the frontal
area, like a plate at the rear edge of the roof, is effective only if the decrease of the
former is larger than the increase of the latter.

Some values of both coefﬁcient Cx and of the product SCx , allowing a more direct
comparison, for more modern cars are reported in Table 21.2.11 By comparing the
values in the table with those reported in Fig. 21.22, the progress which occurred in
the 1980s, mainly linked with the increase of the cost of energy which took place a
decade earlier, is clear. It must be noted, at any rate, that with a few exceptions, the
values of Cx are rarely lower than 0.30, with many cars having a value between 0.30
and 0.40.12

The search for a shape of minimum drag for any particular vehicle can be
approached by identifying a number of critical details and optimizing them one
by one. The principle of effects superimposition cannot be applied in aerodynamics;
the drag of a body is not the sum of the drag of all its parts, and any change to one of
them causes a change in the drag of all others. However, it is a common practice to
obtain the drag of a body as the sum of the drag of its parts plus a further component,

21.3 Aerodynamic Drag

151

referred to as interference drag. This approach has been successfully used ﬁrst in
aeronautics and then in road vehicle technology.

A method known as detail optimization is now widely used. It is based on subse-
quent detail modiﬁcations to achieve drag reductions which can be quite substantial.
The drag coefﬁcient of the base shape is measured and a number of speciﬁc details of
the car body are chosen. One of them is modiﬁed and the wind tunnel test is repeated,
with modiﬁcations continuing until a minimum of drag is obtained. The work is then
repeated for all the chosen details. This procedure can be thought as the search for
the minimum of a function (drag) of many variables (the geometrical characteristics
of the details), by modifying the value of each one of the variables one at a time,
looking for a local minimum in a two-dimensional space and then proceeding to
search for a local minimum in a multi-dimensional space. We are not saying that an
absolute minimum can be reached in this way, nor even that a relative minimum can
be obtained unless an iterative procedure is used, but it is certain that a decrease in
drag is eventually obtained.

An example is shown in Fig. 21.23, where the base shape and ﬁve details are
shown. The thin line gives the initial conﬁguration while the thick one describes the
optimized shape. By operating in the way above, the drag was reduced by about 21%
while a more substantial reduction of 33% could be achieved only by introducing
modiﬁcations which changed to a larger extent the overall appearance of the car.

The results obtained by changing the inclination of the rear part of a hatchback
car are shown in Fig. 21.24: If the angle between the rear window and the horizontal
is larger than 35◦ the value of Cx is 0.4. With a low value of the angle it is possible
to reduce the drag, with a coefﬁcient of about 0.34, but there is a region, at about
28◦ where large vortices produce a substantial increase in drag, up to Cx = 0.44.

This result conﬁrms the already mentioned results obtained from slanted rectangular
blocks.

The advantage of this procedure is in leaving stylists free to design the vehicle
without inhibiting their creativity, while obtaining a shape with low drag without
drastically changing the aesthetic impact of the car.

Alternatively, it is possible to develop from theoretical considerations ideal shapes
aimed at reducing drag to a minimum, modifying these ideal shapes when adapting
them to motor vehicle use. An example of this procedure is shown in Fig. 21.25,
where both the ideal shape and the car derived from it are represented.13 The ideal
shape has been obtained by specifying that the lift and pitching moment must be
zero, the positive pressure gradients must be as low as possible, the cross section of
the body must vary slowly in shape and area, and its contour must be rounded as
much as possible.

The value of Cx of the ideal body in the vicinity of the ground proved to be
as low as 0.049, the same as that of a slender body located at an inﬁnite distance
from the ground. The vehicle obtained from it had a value for Cx of only 0.23,
while maintaining a satisfactory internal space for the occupants, the luggage and
the mechanical components, not unlike a regular saloon car.

As a result of research performed in the 1980s in many countries, it is possible to
state that values of coefﬁcient Cx as low as 0.25 can be achieved without excessive
sacriﬁce to the internal space and general characteristics of the vehicle. The success
of detail optimization procedures allowed designers to overcome fears, expressed
several times in the 1970s, that aerodynamic studies would cause all cars to look
alike, and that the image of individual manufacturers would be sacriﬁced to the need
for good aerodynamic performance.

It is also clear, however, that the lower the drag coefﬁcient is, the fewer are the
advantages of further reductions in fuel consumption, particularly since the average

Fig. 21.25 Ideal and actual shape for a very low-drag research vehicle, shown in the wind tunnel

use of road vehicles occurs at speeds lower than those at which aerodynamic drag is
the most important form of resistance to motion.

As the actual average speed of driving depends mostly on issues unrelated to the
design of vehicles themselves (road conditions, laws and their enforcement etc.), at
present the search for very low drag is not pushed to extremes, at the expense of
other characteristics, mainly aesthetic, in the design of passenger vehicles.

21.3.5 Aerodynamic Drag Reduction: Industrial Vehicles

Even in the recent past, industrial vehicles have usually been designed with little
concern for their aerodynamic characteristics. The low speed and the high value of
the ratio between the mass and the frontal area renders the power needed to overcome
aerodynamic drag a small fraction of the total power needed for motion. However,
the higher speeds industrial vehicles reach on highways and increased concern about
energy saving have led to many studies aimed at reducing the drag in this ﬁeld as
well.

In the case of single-body vehicles, such as buses, vans and trucks without a trailer,
the basic shape is essentially a square box. If the edges are blunt, the value of Cx
is in the range 0.82–0.86, mostly owing to the fact that the ﬂow is widely separated
and the wake is very large (Fig. 21.26).

From this ﬁgure it is clear that any change of shape allowing ﬂow separation to be
reduced is very beneﬁcial: Simply by rounding the edges slightly, the drag coefﬁcient
can be reduced almost by half, to about 0.45.

With an improved frontal proﬁle, values in the range 0.4–0.43 may be obtained
for buses and vans. It is difﬁcult to lower this value further. Fairings on the underside
may make it possible to lower it by about 0.05, but many other devices aimed at
increasing the pressure in the wake have been tried without success.

Tests on models have shown even greater reductions of drag: by simple rounding
of the corners with a 150 mm radius, a value as low as Cx = 0.36 has been obtained.
Two ﬂow stagnation points can be present in articulated vehicles, one on the
cab and one on the trailer, with a ﬂow occurring in the space between the two
bodies. The drag depends largely on their distance d, as shown in Fig. 21.27, referring
to articulated trucks. The dashed zone contains experimental points obtained with
differently shaped cabs.

The value of Cx increases from about 0.72 to about 0.93 when the distance grows
from d = 0 to d = 0.6. To reduce drag, the ﬂow between cab and trailer must be
blocked to create a single stagnation point; the simplest way is to put a vertical ﬂat
plate on the roof of the former (the thin line in Fig. 21.27).

The ﬂow is similar to that characterizing the situation with d = 0; there is a single
stagnation point on the tractor and a separation bubble between the two bodies. A
second separation bubble is formed on the roof of the trailer, owing to the front edge
of the latter. Further decrease of drag may be obtained using shaped deﬂectors on
the roof of the cab.

Vertical ﬂat plates can be put on the roof of the cab (e.g., made by the front side of
the air conditioner box) or the plates may be true, shaped deﬂectors. At any rate, their

deﬂector) on the cab. e Reduction of the drag of articulated vehicles; values obtained on half-size
models

size must be such that the ﬂow reattaches at the front edge of the trailer (Fig. 21.28c).
The planform of the cab must also be designed so that there is no separation on the
sides of the trailer. By using such deﬂectors it is possible to reduce Cx below 0.6.

Rounding the edges of the trailer is effective, in that it makes the partitioning
of the deﬂector on the tractor less critical, avoiding the detaching of the ﬂow if the
deﬂector is too low. At any rate it is more important to design correctly the tractor
and to round the edges of the trailer than to streamlin the two parts independently.

Some results obtained on half scale models are shown in Fig. 21.28e; they show
that with just a few modiﬁcations, including a deﬂector, a large reduction is readily
obtained, while further improvements are difﬁcult to achieve and require a global
streamlining of the vehicle. A value of Cx of about 0.5 can thus be obtained; lower
values, down to 0.24 as obtained on a 1/10 scale model, could be achieved by using
a complete fairing of the underside.

The above mentioned values of Cx all referred to vehicles driven with no aero-
dynamic sideslip angle. If βa is not zero, the aerodynamic ﬁeld and its associated
aerodynamic forces and moments are quite different. This is true for all vehicles, but
holds in particular for industrial vehicles, since the lower speed they usually travel
increases the signiﬁcance of side winds, even those of moderate strength. As an
example, a wind perpendicular to the road blowing at Va = 10 km/h causes an aero-
dynamic sideslip angle βa = 8◦ in the case of a vehicle travelling at V = 70 km/h.
A qualitative plot of Cx as a function of βa for a generic industrial vehicle is shown
in Fig. 21.29a. It must be stressed, however, that if sidewind is present, the sideslip
angle β is not zero. The aerodynamic force Fx is then not exactly aligned with the
velocity V , and the power needed for overcoming aerodynamic drag is Fx V cos(β)

plus the component of the side force Fy in the direction of velocity V . Moreover, the
rolling resistance of the tires increases due to the sideslip angle of the wheels.

The aerodynamic drag of articulated vehicles increases strongly with the aerody-
namic sideslip angle βa for angles between 0 and 20◦. This increase is particularly
noticeable for articulated trucks with aerodynamic devices aimed at preventing air-
ﬂow between tractor and trailer. When lateral wind is present a ﬂow of air in transverse
direction between the cab and the trailer can be created and the advantages obtained
by using deﬂectors end up disappearing for values of βa of about 20◦. Curved deﬂec-
tors work better from this viewpoint than ﬂat plates, which usually cause an increase
of drag at even low values of βa. Curves Cx (βa) for articulated trucks with different
aerodynamic devices are shown in Fig. 21.29b. As shown, the use of deﬂectors must
be accompanied by the rounding of the edges of the trailer.

21.4 Lift and Pitching Moment

Apart from the drag increase due to induced drag, aerodynamic lift must be avoided
since it reduces the load on the tires and consequently the forces the vehicle can
exert on the ground; moreover, this reduction is strongly dependent on the speed.
In the case of vehicles with high power/weight ratio, it is possible to use negative
aerodynamic lift to enhance power transfer through the road-wheel contact. The same
holds for increasing the cornering forces.

In addition, aerodynamic pitching moment My must be as small as possible, since
it causes strong variations in the forces exerted by the wheels on the road, that depend
on speed. With reference to Fig. 21.30, the pitching moment is positive when it acts
to increase the load on the front wheels. As the aerodynamic drag is applied to the

Instead of speaking of lift and pitching moment, the lift is often subdivided on
the two axles and a front axle Fz1 and rear axle Fz2 lift are deﬁned. Similarly, the
lift coefﬁcient Cz is split into two coefﬁcients Cz1 and Cz2 with reference to the
axles. The evolution in time of Cz in passenger cars, split into its components on the
axles, is summarized in Fig. 21.31.14 Lift has remained small and positive (directed
upwards), with a good reduction in recent years, while the average pitching moment
was negative (tending to lower the load on the front axle) up to the 1940s, to decrease
in later years.

Aerodynamic lift and pitching moment depend on the position of the vehicle on
the ground, primarily on the aerodynamic angle of attack α, that in the following
pages is assumed to coincide with the pitch angle θ. Lift can be considered as varying
linearly for small changes of α (or θ), and both Cz and ∂Cz/∂θ must be measured
in the wind tunnel. The same holds for the pitching moment. A plot of the moment

are mostly negative; this is a general rule.

To reduce the lift, and in some cases to make it negative, many current passenger
vehicles are provided with spoilers on the rear part of the body or on the front bumper.
Apart from the obvious consideration that their position and size must be accurately
studied in the wind tunnel since they are useless if located in the wake or in other
zones in which the ﬂow is detached, they must be placed in such a way as to avoid
giving way to pitching moments.

A spoiler usually creates some shape drag, as it increases the size of the wake,
but it can be effective in reducing the total aerodynamic force Fx owing to reduction
of the induced drag (Fig. 21.33).

values of the lift coefﬁcient (b)

Fig. 21.34 Forces and moments acting on the wings of a racing car. Interference between wings
and rotating wheels

Since spoilers cause an increase of pressure on the tail of the vehicle, they usually
create a positive pitching moment. This moment must be compensated by another
surface positioned near the stagnation point, usually referred to as a bumper spoiler,
air dam or apron. Its presence is also usually beneﬁcial on drag.

Strong negative lift forces are obtained in racing cars both by the use of wings
and by a suitable aerodynamic design of the whole body. Usually there is a rear
wing, which may have a multiplane conﬁguration, and a front wing, integrated with
the nose of the vehicle. The airﬂow in the zone where these wings are located is
strongly inﬂuenced by the rotation of the wheels and their actual angle of attack,
i.e. the angle between the surface and the direction of the impinging current may be
quite different from the geometrical angle of attack (Fig. 21.34). Each of the wings
produces a negative lift, a drag, usually quite strong, and a pitching moment. These
must combine in such a way that the total pitching moment acting on the car is as
small as possible.

The entire body of a racing car can be designed to produce negative lift; in fact if
the pressure under the vehicle is lower than atmospheric pressure, strong downwards
forces may be exerted on the underside. Many racers were based on this concept,
with the whole vehicle body designed as a sort of upside-down wing. Suitable side
walls, almost reaching the ground, channelled air below the vehicle, producing an

160

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

area of low pressure and then negative lift. Since aerodynamic devices have a strong
impact on safety, racing regulations deal with them in detail. Since 1983, exploiting
ground effect it is no longer allowed and the bottom of the car must be ﬂat. Since
regulations change often, it is impossible to give general rules on the devices used
on racers to produce negative lift.

21.5 Side Force and Roll and Yaw Moments

If the vehicle has a symmetry plane and is in a symmetrical position with respect to
the airﬂow, i.e. if the roll and the aerodynamic sideslip angles are equal to zero, the
side force Fy, the rolling moment Mx and the yawing moment Mz vanish. In general,
what matters is their rate of change with angle βa and, sometimes, roll angle φ. In
the case of racing cars with uncovered wheels, these forces can also be produced by
offset steering wheels and it is important to study their variation with the steering
angle δ.

For small variations of the mentioned parameters about zero, coefﬁcients C y,
C Mx and C Mz can be approximated by linear functions and their derivatives (C y),βa ,
(C Mx

),βa , etc. can be considered constant.

Some typical curves C y(βa) are reported in Fig. 21.35a. The slope of the curve in
the origin is –2.2 rad−1 for a typical American saloon car and –2.85 rad−1 for a sport
car. For a ﬁrst approximation evaluation of the slope (C y),βa (in rad−1), the following
formula has been suggested

(C y),βa

(cid:8)

(21.19)

where n f is a numerical factor which must be obtained from experimental results on
vehicles similar to the one under study. As already stated, (C y),δa is usually small,
except for racing cars. On some Formula 1 racers a value of 1.37 rad−1 has been
recorded.15

Even more important than the side force, the aerodynamic yawing moment Mz
plays a key role in the dynamics of high speed driving. The evolution of coefﬁcient
C M z in passenger cars is summarized in Fig. 21.36.16

Remark 21.7 A reduction of aerodynamic drag, in particular if low drag is obtained
even at high values of the sideslip angle, is usually detrimental for the lateral force
and above all the yawing moment.

Some typical laws C Mz

(βa) are reported in Fig. 21.37a: Usually the moment is
negative for a positive sideslip angle, which amounts to saying that the side force is
applied in a forward position with respect to the centre of mass. This arrangement,
which occurs very often, is destabilizing at high speed; the value of C Mz may be large
enough to cause force Fy to be applied in front of the vehicle.

a typical saloon car is shown in Fig. 21.37b. From the graph a value of the derivative
(C Mx

),βa for the linear part of 1.05 rad−1 can be obtained.

The presence of external loads on the roof of a car deeply changes aerodynamic
performance. Obviously it increases drag, but it also decreases lift, above all at the
rear axle; in addition, it increases pitching moments and increases sensitivity to side
wind. The aerodynamic coefﬁcients of a saloon car with different roof loads are
reported as an example in Table 21.3.

21.6 Experimental Study of Aerodynamic Forces

The traditional tool for the study of aerodynamic forces and moments is the wind
tunnel. Modern wind tunnels used for road vehicle aerodynamics are specialized
devices, quite different from those used in aeronautics. Wind tunnel tests of cars are
almost always performed on full-size vehicles, since it is very difﬁcult to simulate
with the required precision internal ﬂows on reduced scale models.

Wind tunnels for vehicular use are divided into aerodynamic and climatic tunnels.

The ﬁrst of these are designed to simulate the aerodynamic ﬁeld for the measure-
ment of aerodynamic forces and moments, of pressure distribution, etc. and their
main requirement is an accurate simulation of the aerodynamic ﬁeld surrounding the
moving vehicle.

Climatic tunnels are used to simulate motion in various climatic conditions, by
controlling the temperature of the air and often its humidity. Provisions for producing
rain, snow, various sun conditions, etc. are often included. Usually it is possible to
run the engine and brake the driving wheels to study, in a realistic way, the temper-
ature conditions in the engine compartment and the working of the cooling and air
conditioning systems. The simulation of the aerodynamic ﬁeld may be less accurate.
Sometimes the two functions are be combined in a single aerodynamic and cli-
matic tunnel, but the convenience of building a single plant for the two tasks instead
of two different tunnels must be assessed in each case, keeping in mind above all the
compatibility of the balance that measures aerodynamic forces and moments with
the rollers that brake the driving wheels.

Climatic tunnels allow the vehicle to be tested in extreme conditions without the
need for moving instrumentation and personnel to distant, uncomfortable places, or
waiting for extreme climatic conditions to occur in a given place.

The main tests that can be performed in aerodynamic tunnels are:

• Measurement of aerodynamic forces and moments. The three components of both

force and moment are measured using a six-component balance.

• Visualization of the airﬂow around and inside the vehicle and measurement of the
pressure at given points of the surface or in other points of the aerodynamic ﬁeld.
Other measurements aimed at understanding the aerodynamic ﬁeld.

• Measurement of aerodynamic noise, possibly when other sources of noise (engine,

transmission, etc.) are present.

Climatic tunnels allow tests to be performed on the behavior of the body (water-
prooﬁng, accumulation of dirt, ice formation, weathering, etc.) and of mechanical
parts (cooling of engine, starting, air conditioning, operation of the electric devices,

164

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

etc.) in various climates. Climatic tunnels must be large enough to allow full scale
vehicles to be tested, and they must have rollers to brake the wheels and simulate
inertias to properly simulate road loads on the driving wheels. The latter device makes
it difﬁcult to build tunnels that include a balance for the measurement of forces and
moments.

Aerodynamic tunnels for motor vehicles also have a similar size, for as we have
seen, the use of models in motor vehicle aerodynamics leads to much less accurate
results.

Wind tunnels may be of the open or closed circuit type. While in the former the
fan must supply all the kinetic energy of the stream, in closed circuit tunnels some
of the kinetic energy of the air that ﬂows around the vehicle is recovered, and the
motor needs to supply to the ﬂow only an energy equal to the losses.

The efﬁciency, deﬁned as the ratio between the power of the airstream and the

motor power

η =

1

2 ρV 3 A

,

(21.22)

of closed circuit tunnels is higher than that of open circuit ones, and is often higher
than 1.

Open circuit tunnels are simpler, smaller and cheaper but are energetically less
efﬁcient. A cost trade-off for the two types of plant must be performed in each case.
While in the aeronautical ﬁeld most wind tunnels are of the closed circuit type,
modern plants for vehicular use are mostly open, perhaps with air recirculation within
the building to avoid the need of ﬁltering large quantities of air and to reduce noise
pollution to the environment. Recirculation can also increase energy efﬁciency.

To perform aerodynamic tests on vehicles, high airspeeds are not needed, since
a speed of about 10 m/s is high enough to reach values of the Reynolds number of
about 2 or 3 million. Tests are generally performed at a speed of 20 or 30 m/s, creating
strong enough aerodynamic forces to allow easy and precise measurements.

Climatic tunnels must reach higher speeds, close to the maximum speed of the
vehicle. Since the test chamber of wind tunnels for road vehicles has a sectional area
of about 10−30 m2, the motor must have a power of several hundred or thousand kW.
In climatic closed circuit (or open circuit with recirculation of air) tunnels, the power
of the refrigerators must be higher than that of the motors, at least if low temperature
tests at top speed must be performed.

The type, shape and size of the test chamber is of primary importance in aerody-
namic wind tunnels. The aerodynamic ﬁeld around the test object must simulate as
accurately as possible that occurring in free air, and this is easier if the test chamber
is large, or rather if the value of the ratio between the area of the air jet and the area
of the cross section of the test object is high.

On the other hand, it is clear that the smaller the size of the jet, the lower the
power required, as well as the size and cost of the whole plant. The shape of the cross
section of the test chamber must be accurately chosen to obtain the required precision
with as small a jet as possible. This consideration is, however, mitigated by the fact
that a test chamber with rounded walls is much more costly than a rectangular one,

21.6 Experimental Study of Aerodynamic Forces

165

so that a rectangular jet is often used, even if by doing so a larger wind tunnel, with
greater power requirements, is needed.

The designer of a wind tunnel must choose between an open or closed test cham-
ber. Closed test chambers, like the ones used in most aeronautical wind tunnels, have
lower losses but usually require larger jet areas to obtain the same precision in the
simulation of the aerodynamic ﬁeld. Taking both factors into account, closed test
chambers require greater power, at least in automotive wind tunnels. An alternative
is the use of closed test chambers with porous walls, that is walls allowing a certain
quantity of air to be extracted from the ﬂow, with consequent reduction in the thick-
ness of the boundary layer. Another possibility is the use of adaptive test chambers,
in which a number of actuators allow the shape of the test chamber to be changed
so that the streamlines at a certain distance from the vehicle are similar to those
occurring in a free ﬂow.

Sketches of six of the most important vehicular wind tunnels are plotted in
Fig. 21.38. Three of them have a closed circuit and three are open, two with air recir-
culation. The cross section of the Pininfarina wind tunnel is shown in Fig. 21.39,
as an example of a modern climatic aerodynamic tunnel with open circuit and air
recirculation and open test chamber.

Peculiar difﬁculties encountered in wind tunnel testing of vehicles are linked
with the presence of the ground. To simulate the motion of the ground with respect
to the vehicle, a sort of carpet moving at the speed of the air should be used, with
the wheels rolling on it. This approach has many drawbacks, particularly in terms
of wheel rotation. If the vehicle is kept at a small distance from the ground and
the wheels are moved by motors inside the vehicle or model, a ﬂow of air between
the wheels and the ground would result and the resulting negative lift would affect the
measurement of aerodynamic actions. If, on the contrary, the wheels are actually in
contact with the ground, they would exchange forces with the carpet, affecting again
the measurement of forces and moments, unless the whole system, carpet included,
is on the balance measuring the forces. In that case, the forces between wheels and
carpet are internal forces and are not measured.

Alternatively, it is possible to use a narrow, moving carpet located inside the
wheels, which are supported on the ﬁxed ﬂoor (hence rotation of the wheels is not
simulated) or on rollers. In whatever way the motion of the ground is simulated, the
problem of the boundary layer on the ground remains. As shown in Fig. 21.40a, if
the ground does not move with respect to the vehicle, the latter is partially in the
boundary layer of the ground.

The simplest way to simulate the presence of the ground is to use a second vehicle
located in a mirror position with respect to the ground that physically does not exist
(Fig. 21.40b). This approach is difﬁcult to apply in full size testing, since the two
vehicles must be suspended in a way that does not disturb the aerodynamic ﬁeld, and
the cross section of the jet is doubled. It is much easier to apply it in tests on models.
The approaches shown in Fig. 21.40c, d, g, h, i are based on aspiration, or blowing
the boundary layer so that the velocity proﬁle of the air close to the ground is similar
to that occurring when the vehicle moves with respect to it. In Fig. 21.40e, f the
vehicle is at a distance from the ﬂoor, on a surface (that does not move) simulating

the ground, or on nothing. In the latter case, the wheels are in a different situation
from the actual one. In Fig. 21.40l a small deﬂector deviates the air stream to the
sides, to reduce the boundary layer of the ground.

In Fig. 21.40m, n, o, three ways to allow the rotation of the wheels are shown. One
large roller, two small rollers or a belt supported by three rollers allow the wheels to
rotate. They must be located on the balance, so that the forces they exchange with
the vehicle are not measured along with the aerodynamic forces. An alternative is to
substitute soft elements, similar to brushes, for the ground under the wheels, allowing

them to rotate but blocking the air ﬂow beneath them and producing no large forces
that may affect measurements.

Another problem is that of air turbulence. Aeronautic wind tunnels are usually
designed to have the lowest possible turbulence, while the air vehicles meet as they
move, particularly on windy days, is more or less turbulent. Nets or other devices to
increase air turbulence are therefore used in automotive wind tunnels.

Automotive aerodynamics is based on full scale tests, as we have seen; however,
tests on reduced scale models are also used, especially for industrial vehicles or in
the early development stages of cars. The main advantage of tests on models is their
reduced cost, both in the construction and modifying of models and the use of small
size tunnels. Nor is the cost reduction due to the reduced time needed to prepare
and perform tests negligible. The disadvantages of models are linked to their limited
geometric similitude and to the difﬁculty of obtaining a good dynamic similitude.
Both these problems increase when model sizes are reduced.

In 1/2 or 1/3 scale models it is possible to reproduce tiny details (to study internal
ﬂows, internal details of the engine compartment must also be reproduced), even if
this causes an increase in the cost of the models. It is difﬁcult to maintain detailed
geometrical similarity if the scale is smaller.

To achieve dynamic similarity, the Reynolds number must be the same as in the
actual vehicle, and the simplest method is to operate at a correspondingly increased
speed. Again, this is possible in tests at 1/2 or 1/3 scale, while for models in smaller
scale the required speed may be too high, with a correspondingly high Mach number,
that may lead to erroneous values for the aerodynamic coefﬁcients.

While in aeronautic closed circuit tunnels it is possible to operate at a pressure
higher than atmospheric pressure (by increasing the pressure the kinematic viscosity
decreases and the Reynolds number increases), open circuit tunnels must operate at
atmospheric pressure and thus cannot compensate for the small scale of the model.
In spite of all the above problems, wind tunnel tests, particularly if performed on
full scale vehicles with simulation of internal ﬂows, remain the best way to measure
aerodynamic forces and moments acting on road vehicles.

For the measurement of drag alone, it is possible to perform road tests in which
the vehicle is allowed to coast down from various speeds on level road: From the
deceleration law the total drag acting on the vehicle is computed. The main drawback
of these tests is that it is impossible to separate the contribution of drag due to
aerodynamics from that due to rolling resistance and all other forms of drag caused
by the mechanical elements operating during the test. If rolling resistance were
independent from the speed and Cx were constant, function d V /dt would be of the
type:

(cid:8)

d V

− f0mg − 1

,

(21.23)

and hence it would be enough to approximate the measured law d V /dt with a
parabola and to compute Cx from the coefﬁcient of the quadratic term.

21.6 Experimental Study of Aerodynamic Forces

169

The actual rolling resistance is of the type

Fr = −mg( f0 + K V 2) ,

and both forms of drag are included in the quadratic term. Only using experimental
data on rolling resistance in operating conditions is it possible to interpret coast-down
tests correctly. It is possible to obtain realistic values of the aerodynamic drag, and
hence of Cx , if tests of the type of those shown in Fig. 2.78, Vol. 1 are performed on
the whole vehicle.

Even if the aerodynamic ﬁeld cannot achieve the correct conﬁguration charac-
terizing the steady state conditions at any speed during a cost down test, these tests
are usually performed to compare the values of Cx obtained in the wind tunnel with
those obtained in close to actual operating conditions, although the latter may be
approximated.

21.7 Numerical Aerodynamics

In the last thirty years, numerical methods based on various discretization tech-
niques applied to the Navier-Stokes equations were developed. The diffusion of such
methods, usually referred to as numerical or computational aerodynamics, has been
made possible by the availability of computers with increasing power and by the
introduction of new computational techniques.

While in aeronautics computational aerodynamics has reached a point where it is
possible to compute in a precise and reliable way the aerodynamic ﬁeld and forces
acting on aircraft (even if the validation of the results with experimental tests in the
wind tunnel are still needed), in road vehicle aerodynamics the possibility of using
computational aerodynamics to substitute at least partially for wind tunnel testing
remains controversial, and we seem to be still far from achieving this goal.

This difference is linked with the difﬁculty of predicting numerically where the
ﬂow detaches from the body: computational aerodynamics yields very good results
in case of attached ﬂows, but when large wakes or separation bubbles are present the
computation becomes more difﬁcult and the results less reliable. Numerical methods
may, on the contrary, be used without problems in automotive aerodynamics if the
location where the ﬂow detaches is known.

Numerical aerodynamics is based mainly on the discretization of the aerodynamic
ﬁeld, and on the use of a simpliﬁed form of the Navier-Stokes equations. The simplest
approach is the use of the boundary elements method, which in aerodynamics is often
referred to as the panels method. Only the surface of the body needs to be discretized
(Fig. 21.41a). This is a linearized method, and can be used on an attached inviscid
ﬂow, although it may be applied also to zones where the separation zone is known
and described geometrically with high precision. It is a technique widely used in
aeronautics, but in the automotive case it requires the use of experimental techniques
to deﬁne the zones where the ﬂow separates.

21 An Overview on Motor Vehicle Aerodynamics

Fig. 21.41 Discretization of the surface of a car to compute the aerodynamic ﬁeld using the panels
method (a) and of the whole aerodynamic ﬁeld using the ﬁnite element approach (b)

The methods based on the discretization of the whole aerodynamic ﬁeld up to a
certain distance from the vehicle (ﬁnite differences method, ﬁnite elements method
(FEM, Fig. 21.41b)) allow nonlinear forms of the Navier-Stokes equations to be
discretized as well, and the zone where the ﬂow detaches to be computed through
iterative techniques. Combined approaches are also possible, to combine the advan-
tages of the various methods.

An example of the computation of the pressure distribution, accurately obtained
using the ﬁnite volumes methods, is shown in Fig. 21.42.18 To obtain such a good
result, the aerodynamic ﬁeld was subdivided into more than 5 million cells.

The hopes that numerical aerodynamics raised must be at least partly downsized,
even if it is becoming (or better, may become in the future) a powerful tool. It allows

that it may become, in the foreseeable future, an alternative to experimental testing.

Chapter 22
Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Books about automotive chassis design usually do not include a discussion about
car prime movers and their energy sources, which are dealt with in details in books
devoted to the study of engine or electric systems design. Nevertheless the opinion
of the authors is that is quite impossible to design the performance of a chassis in
terms of longitudinal dynamics, considering the prime mover as a black box only.

Therefore the aim of this chapter is providing the chassis engineer with a basic
knowledge on prime movers needed to specify them correctly and to design the
relevant chassis interfaces, mainly the transmission, having the ability to modeling
and predicting the entire vehicle system performance. Obviously, in the daily work,
the best results must be obtained, as in every ﬁeld of engineering, approaching also
chassis design with a multidisciplinary working team.

22.1 Energy for Vehicles

The motion of all vehicles requires the expenditure of a certain quantity of mechanical
energy, and in motor vehicles the system that supplies such energy (in most cases an
internal combustion engine) is on board. The lack of an adequate prime mover is the
main reason that mechanical vehicles could be built only at the end of the industrial
revolution, and entered mass production only in the twentieth century, in spite of
attempts dating back to ancient times.

For a mechanical vehicle to be built, a prime mover able to move not only itself,
but the vehicle structure and payload as well, was needed. Remembering that the
power needed to move the mass m at the speed V on a level surface with coefﬁcient
of friction (sliding or rolling) f is equal to P = mg f V , it is easy to conclude that
the minimum value of the power/mass ratio of a prime mover able to move itself is:
Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

where α is the ratio between the mass me of the engine and the total mass m of the
vehicle and η is the total efﬁciency of the mechanism which transfers the power and
propels the vehicle.

Prime movers with an adequate power/mass ratio and transmission devices with
a power rating and an efﬁciency high enough to allow the motion of the vehicle were
not practical until the nineteenth century.

The engine must obtain the energy required for motion from an energy source that
is usually on board the vehicle. Rail vehicles often receive such energy from outside,
but the only road vehicles in which this occurs are trolleybuses.

In most cases, the energy is stored as the chemical energy of a fuel, but it can
be stored in the form of electrochemical energy (electrical batteries) or, even if few
attempts in this direction have been made, and even fewer vehicles of this type have
a practical use, as kinetic energy (ﬂywheels) or elastic energy (springs).

These forms of energy storage are compared in Table 22.1.
When two or more different types of energy are stored or supplied to a vehicle
that can work either with energy supplied from the outside or with energy stored on
board, and if the two modes of operation are used independently, the vehicle is said
to be bimodal. A trolleybus with batteries that allow it to go on a part of its route
where there is no power distribution is an example of a bimodal vehicle.

Vehicles with two or more methods of energy storage, in which one is used not
only to supply energy but also to store energy coming from one of the other sources,
are said to be hybrid. An example is a bus with an internal combustion engine and
batteries, in which the electric energy is also used to transform the energy from the
engine with greater efﬁciency and to recover braking energy.

It is also possible to have a bimodal hybrid vehicle if, in the previous example,
the energy to charge the batteries is supplied not only by the thermal engine but also
by the mains.

In vehicles there are huge quantities of energy that may be recovered. Theoreti-
cally, all energy not dissipated (by aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance, losses
in the transmission and energy conversion) can be recovered.

If the kinetic energy or the gravitational potential energy of the vehicle is recovered

when slowing down or travelling downhill, regenerative braking occurs.

When the only form of energy storage on board is chemical energy, regenerative
braking is not possible, while it may be implemented in the other cases of Table 22.1.
Energy recovery can, however, be only partial, not only due to the intrinsic losses of
all energy transformations, but also because of the peculiar characteristics of braking.
The power involved in braking is hardly manageable by the device that has to
convert the energy taken from the vehicle into usable energy, except in the case
of slowing down with limited deceleration. Usually, to allow regenerative braking,
there must be two braking systems, with the traction motors (in the case of electric
vehicles) providing regenerative braking when slowing down or travelling downhill,
while a conventional braking system performs, in a non-regenerative way, emergency
or sudden decelerations.

The largest majority of present motor vehicles are powered by reciprocating inter-
nal combustion engines, running on fuels derived from oil or—seldom—natural gas.
The power is transmitted to the wheels through a transmission which, in the simplest
case, is made of a friction clutch, a manual multiple ratios transmission and a dif-
ferential gear. This scheme is different in automatic transmissions where the friction
clutch may be substituted by a torque converter, but different schemes like robotized
gearboxes and Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) are also used.

This scheme has a large number of advantages, like low cost, high power and
energy to weight ratios and relatively low quantity of energy required for manufac-
turing the relevant hardware, but has also three disadvantages which are considered
increasingly severe:
• the alleged increasing scarcity (and ﬁnally depletion) of fossil fuels,
• the emission of polluant substances during use,
• the emission of greenhouse gases during use.

To summarize in a few words, our present way of powering motor vehicles is

allegedly unsustainable both environmentally and economically.

The ﬁrst point is simply not true: the reserves of oil and natural gases are con-
tinuously increasing, due to new discoveries, and not decreasing, even if the cost of
extraction of fossil fuels is increasing. This problem was strongly put in evidence at
the beginning of the 1970s, when the cost of oil sharply increased, even if later it
was understood that this was caused by political problems and by speculation and
not by the scarcity of crude oil.

In general, the problems linked with the increase of cost of fossil fuels are mitigated
by reducing the fuel consumption of vehicles which, as we will see below, is important
also for the other two points.

The second point was ﬁrst evidenced in the 1960s when the attention was drawn
on the environmental impact due to the widespread use of road vehicles, in particular
in highly populated areas like cities. Since then strict regulations have been imposed
regarding emissions, while it was left to the market forces to convince manufacturers
to invest in reduction of fuel consumption. This trend was reinforced in the follow-
ing years and the standards on emissions and then also on consumption, became

176

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

increasingly strict. At present, environmental regulations deal mainly with polluant
substances like unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides NOx , carbon monoxide CO
and particulates.

The third point deals with greenhouse gases and in particular with carbon dioxide
(CO2). The latter cannot be considered as a pollutant, since it is in itself not dangerous
for life-forms (it is essential to plant life), but above a certain global concentration
may cause an increase of the temperature of Earth. Note that some greenhouse effect
is required, since without it Earth would be too cold. The amount of carbon dioxide
a vehicle releases into the atmosphere depends mainly on its fuel consumption, but
also on the type of fuel it burns, with methane being the fuel which releases the
smallest quantity of carbon dioxide.

The two problems are here dealt with together, since some solutions that could
reduce pollution may cause an increase of fuel consumption and vice-versa. For a
correct approach, they should be studied in a global way: it is not just a problem
of how much pollutants are produced or energy is used by a certain vehicle when it
operates, but what is the global pollution and energy consumption of a given vehicle
through its whole life-cycle, i.e. the pollution and energy requirements in a vehicle’s
production, maintenance and disposal must be also accounted for. Operating in this
way the total distance travelled by a vehicle in its useful life becomes important: If
a vehicle is little used what most matters is the pollution and energy consumption in
construction and disposal, while the importance of these two phases of the vehicle
lifecycle reduces with increasing distance travelled by the vehicle during its life.

Any change in a vehicle that is introduced to reduce its emissions or to improve its
fuel efﬁciency, but affects negatively the pollution or energy use in its construction
(for instance owing to the greater complexity or the use of particular materials) has a
positive effect starting only from a given actual utilization of the vehicle: a complex
hybrid vehicle may be expedient if used as a taxi, but not as a private, seldom used,
city car.

The ways proposed for improving future vehicles from these viewpoints are many,
but the main ones are related with innovative drivelines: electric vehicles, hybrid
vehicles, vehicles using ‘alternative’ fuels. This does not cover all the possible inno-
vations in this sector, since any improvement that can be made in energy efﬁciency
in general, like reducing aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, weight, etc. causes
a reduction of energy consumption and, as a consequence, reduces pollution and
greenhouse gases emissions owing to a decrease of the fuel that has to be burned.

The energy needed for motor vehicle propulsion may be generated and stored in
various ways. Traditionally, non-renewable sources of energy, mostly oil and derivate
products (gasoline and diesel fuel) assumed a dominating, although not exclusive,
role. Technological developments today allow us to design different scenarios in
which primary renewable sources of energy may come into play, contributing to
both improving environmental conditions and safeguarding the reserves of natural
resources.

The chart in Fig. 22.1 shows the primary energy sources that can be used by
each kind of propulsion system and how they are conveyed to their ﬁnal use. The
intermediate forms of energy can also be called energy vectors. The chart is far from

22.1 Energy for Vehicles

177

Fig. 22.1 Chart showing how primary energy sources, classiﬁed as renewable and non-renewable,
can be conveyed to their ﬁnal use in automotive applications. The darker path is the traditional one.
The chart doesn’t show all possible paths

being complete, but covers the traditional approach (darker path) and many of those
that have been suggested for the future. In particular, hydrogen has been assumed
to be produced through water electrolysis, while at present only 3% of the total
hydrogen production is obtained in this way.1

A vehicle ﬂeet including vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines (gaso-
line, diesel, LPG, natural gas and hydrogen), electric batteries, hybrid systems and
fuel cells can have its energy requirements met by diversifying the sources of energy
including renewable, and therefore inexhaustible, ones. Even internal combustion
engine fuels may be derived from oil, coal, natural gas (methane), biomass decom-
position or water hydrolysis (hydrogen). On the other hand, the electricity needed to
power electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and to produce hydrogen through water
electrolysis may be generated by thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar power
stations.

In conclusion, today’s exclusive dependency on oil and derivate products could
be mitigated by diversifying the type of vehicles in the ﬂeet and therefore the sources
of energy needed to meet demand. In this light, to ensure sustainable mobility whilst
protecting the environment and saving energy, the motor vehicle ﬂeet will gradually

1Other hydrogen production methods are steam methane reforming, thermal cracking, coal and
biomass gasiﬁcation and pyrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis; in recent times also biological
production methods are under investigation on transforming the hydrogen in a kind of renewable
energy source. In fact a wide variety of waste and low-value materials such as agricultural biomass
could be utilized in principle to produce hydrogen via biochemical pathways.

Fig. 22.2 Possible scenario for market shares of present and future fuels/power plants

evolve by adopting a diversity of power plant solutions. A prediction of the possible
future development of car power plants in Europe in the next 20 years is shown in
Fig. 22.2.

In this prediction, gasoline and diesel engines will continue to dominate the market
in the foreseeable future. The introduction of direct injection and current progress in
engine management strategies and exhaust gas post-treatment systems will ensure
that the ambitious emission and fuel consumption targets stated by new emission
and consumption standards are met without sacriﬁcing the ﬂexibility, convenience
and driving pleasure we are used to enjoy. Concurrently, the market share of gaseous
fuels powered engines—liquiﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) and especially natural gas—is
expected to continue to increase as, in general, motorists consider their performance
to be comparable to that of conventional engines; in addition they are cheaper to run
(provided the current level of fuel taxation is maintained) and more environmentally
friendly. In the ﬁgure the present trend of reducing the use of diesel engines has not
yet been considered, so that it is likely that, starting from 2020, the share of diesel
engines will reduce if compared with gasoline engines.

Electric cars, despite their limited range and high costs (bound to remain so for
many years to come), may offer the right solution for urban mobility, if made available
at city entry points where motorists can park their own vehicle and hire an electric
car for use in town. Initiatives of this kind, tried in European cities, are proof of
the feasibility of such solutions. Fleets of vehicles owned by public authorities and
private companies may also be converted to battery electric vehicles without losing
in efﬁciency and with signiﬁcant advantages for the urban environment.

Finally, whilst hybrid or fuel cell powered cars can offer near-zero emissions and
solve the problem of limited range of electric cars, their impact is unlikely to radically
alter the future scenario, because of their cost; nevertheless they represent the only

22.1 Energy for Vehicles

179

available technology to reduce consumption and emissions to a minimum, without
changes in our everyday life. A prudential estimate suggests that the total of electric
and hybrid vehicles is expected to reach a 10% share of the market.

22.2 Vehicular Engines

The storage of energy in a liquid, less frequently gaseous, form of fuel has so many
advantages that this form of energy storage has supplanted all others since the begin-
ning of the twentieth century. The advantages of easy resupply (recharging) and
above all the very high energy density are overwhelming.

The chemical energy of the fuel (gasoline, diesel fuel, but also liqueﬁed petroleum
gas (LPG), methane, methylic or ethylic alcohols, etc.) is converted into mechanical
energy by a thermal engine. In spite of the low conversion efﬁciency that characterizes
all thermal engines, the actually available energy density is about 30–50 times greater
than that of other energy storage devices. The power density is also very high.

The ﬁrst self-propelled road vehicles were built at the end of the eighteenth and
above all at the beginning of the nineteenth century owing to the development of
thermal engines, in this case reciprocating steam engines. However, while steam
engines were adequate for ships and railway engines, their power/weight ratio was
too low for road vehicles. This issue, together with other technical and non-technical
factors, made steam coaches a commercial failure.

Only at the end of the nineteenth century did the development of reciprocating

internal combustion engines allow the diffusion of motor vehicles.

As road vehicles began to spread, three competing types of engine were available:
steam engines, that in the interim had undergone drastic improvements to become
adapted to lightweight vehicles, the new internal combustion engines, and DC electric
motors combined with recently developed lead acid accumulators. For a time it looked
as though the electric motor would become the most common alternative, owing to
its reliability, cleanliness, quietness and ease of control. The various types of engine
were balanced in performance, as shown by the fact that the ﬁrst car able to overcome
the 100 km/h barrier in 1898 was an electric vehicle.

However, then as today, the main drawback of the electric vehicle, its unsatisfac-

tory range, prevented its diffusion.

The reciprocating internal combustion engine become the main source of power
for all road vehicles, and has remained so since the ﬁrst decades of the twentieth
century.

In the 1960s, after the great success of turbojet and turboprop engines in aeronau-
tics, which would quickly almost completely replace reciprocating engines in aircraft
and helicopters, several attempts to introduce gas turbines in motor vehicles were
made. They were unsuccessful, primarily because of the strong fuel consumption at
idle.

At the same time, attempts to reintroduce the steam engine were also made,
primarily for reducing pollution and for the scarcity, then more supposed than actual,

180

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

of fuels suitable for reciprocating engines. Even if steam engines were much different
from those of the previous century, the results were not satisfactory.

A further attempt to innovate, although less radical, was the introduction of rotary
internal combustion engines. Some vehicles with this innovative engine were mass
produced and had a limited commercial success, but this attempt was likewise another
failure.

It is likely that the greatest advantage of the reciprocating automotive engine
is a century of uninterrupted development, leading to performance, low cost and
reliability that could not be imagined one century ago.

Practically, every attempt to substitute a different propulsion device to solve one
of its many problems was answered with industry innovations that solved, in an
equally (or more) satisfactory way, the same problems.

The issues that fuel today’s drive to replace the internal combustion engine with
a prime mover of a different kind remain its dependence on liquid hydrocarbons as
fuel and the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases.

The dependence on fuels derived from oil is characteristic of the whole economic
system. Even if electric vehicles became widespread or hydrogen took over as fuel,
this problem would remain essentially unchanged if the primary energy used to
produce electric energy or hydrogen came from the combustion of oil derivatives.
More precisely, the problem would become worse, owing to lower overall energy
efﬁciency (from well to wheel, as is usually said).

Only a massive use of nuclear energy, possibly with some contribution from
renewable sources including hydrocarbons derived from biomasses, can radically
solve this problem.

Environmental problems due to pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
particulates, etc., all substances not necessarily produced by combustion, have
already been tackled with success and modern internal combustion engines are much
cleaner than older ones. This trend is bound to continue in the future.

Carbon dioxide, on the contrary, is the result of the type of fuel used and can
be reduced only by using fuels with lower carbon content, like methane, and only
completely eliminated by using hydrogen. However, the production of hydrogen
must use a primary source that does not produce carbon dioxide, like nuclear energy.
Hydrogen can be used both in internal combustion engines and in fuel cells.
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices able to directly convert the energy of a
fuel-oxidizer pair into electric energy, without a combustion process taking place.
Since in this transformation there is no intermediate stage of thermal energy, the
efﬁciency can be, theoretically, higher than that of any thermal engine, even if it is
limited by losses of various kinds.

The reactions occurring in fuel cells are electrochemical reactions of the kind
typical of batteries. The choice of fuel is severely limited, since the use of molecules
that may be easily ionized is mandatory. Hydrogen is the most common choice,
even if methane is an interesting alternative, while the oxidizer must be, in vehicular
applications, atmospheric oxygen. The energy density of fuel cells using liquid fuels
like methanol or formic acid is too low for vehicular applications.

22.2 Vehicular Engines

181

The problems linked with the use of hydrogen as a fuel primarily relate to its low
volume energy density (its mass energy density is, on the contrary, quite high) and
to the subsequent need to use pressurized tanks, cryogenic storage at 20 ◦K, or to
resort to technologies like those based on metal hydrides. There are also problems
involved in its supply network. The technological problems are being solved, since
hydrogen is used in experimental vehicles as a fuel for internal combustion engines,
and in many countries there are already a number of supply points. Safety does not
seem to be a problem, since hydrogen is not much more dangerous than a highly
ﬂammable and volatile liquid such as gasoline.

Hydrogen may also be stored on board as methanol or methane, from which
hydrogen is then obtained by chemical dissociation. This solution has the drawback
of causing poisoning of the fuel cell catalyst if impurities due to this process remain
in the hydrogen.

At present there are many types of fuel cells, based on different types of mem-
branes and catalysts. They operate at different temperatures (from less than 100 ◦C
to more than 900 ◦C, the latter being unsuitable for vehicular use), and each has its
advantages and drawbacks. The technology developed in the aerospace ﬁeld (fuel
cells were developed in the 1960s for the Apollo programme and then used on the
Space Shuttle) cannot be used in road vehicles. Many problems are still to be solved,
from cost to reliability, with added problems linked to their use under the conditions
of much variable load and reduced maintenance that are typical of motor vehicles.
Until fuel cells suitable for vehicular use are available, the only way to use electric
motors is by employing accumulators. Their worst drawback is the impossibility of
obtaining high energy density and power density at the same time. This is particularly
true for lead-acid accumulators, whose energy density decreases fast with increasing
power density, that is, with increasing current.

Also, the duration and the efﬁciency of batteries decrease with increasing power
density. The ﬁeld of batteries for vehicular propulsion has seen much research activity,
and the possibility of building electric vehicles with performance not much different
from that of vehicles with internal combustion engines, especially in terms of range,
may yet emerge.

The possibility of using different forms of energy accumulators in a single vehicle
in a hybrid conﬁguration is particularly interesting. This technology has already
entered mass production.

22.3 Automotive Fuels

22.3.1 Conventional Fuels

All hydrocarbon fuels are basically made of carbon and hydrogen so that, when
burnt, they produce carbon dioxide and water. The traditional diesel fuel and gasoline
are mixtures of different hydrocarbons and their reference composition is isooctane

182

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

C8H18 for gasoline and cetane C16H34 for diesel fuel. The simplest hydrocarbon,
producing the least carbon dioxide, is methane, CH4, the primary constituent of
liqueﬁed or compressed natural gas. Propane, C3H8, is the primary constituent of
liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG).

The amount of carbon dioxide produced depends on the ratio between the carbon
and the hydrogen atoms the fuel contains. The speciﬁc CO2 emission referred to
the energy contained in the fuel is 0.25 kg/kWh for gasoline, 0.27 kg/kWh for diesel
fuel, 0.23 kg/kWh for liquid petroleum gas and 0.20 kg/kWh for natural gas. These
values depend however on the exact composition of the fuel and on the assumptions
made on how well the combustion is carried out. At any rate they refer to the energy
contained in the fuel; to refer them to the energy produced by the engine the efﬁciency
of the latter must be kept into account. This is important above all when comparing
gasoline with diesel fuel, since diesel engines have a better efﬁciency than spark
ignition ones.

The pollution produced by burning all these fuels depends mostly on how they
are burned and how the exhaust gases are dealt with; it is thus more a matter of the
engine than of the fuel: as already stated, in ideal conditions the combustion products
of all these fuels would be only carbon dioxide and water.

The use of LPG or natural gas (the hydrocarbon with least carbon) instead of
gasoline or diesel would reduce CO2 emission, although not by a large proportion.
They are also considered beneﬁcial for pollutant emissions in general, since it is easier
to keep low the contents of most pollutants, in particular unburned hydrocarbons and
particulate.

22.3.2 Oxygenated Fuels

Non conventional fuels contain also constituents that are not strictly hydrocarbons,
but contain also a small quantity of oxygen, like alcohol fuels such as methanol,
CH3OH and ethanol C2H5OH, and biodiesel. They are often referred to as oxygenated
fuels.

A completely different issue is the use of biofuels, including alcohol produced
from plants and biodiesel: They are usually considered to have a speciﬁc CO2 emis-
sion equal to zero. The rationale behind this statement is that by producing the
biological material from which the fuel is produced the plants subtract from the
atmosphere the same quantity of carbon dioxide that will be reintroduced when
burning the fuel, with a zero greenhouse gases balance. The problem with biofuels
is not technological, but an economical and ethical one: if crops are speciﬁcally cul-
tivated for producing fuels in any globally consistent amount, this will result in a
reduction of the soil dedicated to growing edible plants and thus in a decrease of the
food production and an increase of food price. A different matter is whether biofuels
are produced from crop residues and waste (straw, cellulosic biomass, etc.). These
considerations are controversial, with some asserting that the food price increase of
2007–2008 was due to the increase of biofuel production, and deﬁning the latter as a

22.3 Automotive Fuels

183

crime against humanity, and others who stated that the impact of biofuel production
on the price of food was small. At any rate the idea of using land to cultivate plants
for the primary reason of producing fuel does not seem to be good.

As a general conclusion it can be stated that the use of alternative fuels does not
require substantial changes as far as vehicles are concerned, since most engines can
be easily adapted to burn different fuels. This is the reason why so many prototype
vehicles burning a wide variety of alternative fuels were presented and demonstrated
at shows. The problems mostly regard the distribution networks to make these fuels
available to the general public and thus are of organizational and not of technical
nature. In some countries, like Brazil, there is already a good experience in using
biofuels (e.g. bioethanol) or various mixtures of traditional and alternative fuels (like
the so called gasohol, 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, or E85, 85% ethanol and
15% gasoline). In any case, the use of these fuels can improve the situation as far
as greenhouse gases are concerned, and can decrease the dependence of a country
on imported energy products. From a global viewpoint, however, in countries where
a good fraction of the electric energy is produced by fossil fuels, it is not of much
importance whether biofuels are burnt in cars or in power stations.

22.3.3 Hydrogen

Generation

Hydrogen was discovered by Cavendish in 1766 (Fig. 22.3). Lavoisier realized that it
was an element, and named it hydrogen; immediately it was realized that it was very
ﬂammable and difﬁcult to contain since it escaped from even the smallest porosities
of the container. Nonetheless, just 17 years after it was discovered, large quantities of
the gas were used by Jacques Charles to inﬂate an aerostat which ﬂew on December
1st, 1783. It is also interesting to remember that the ﬁrst self propelling vehicle in the
world, developed in 1807 by Isaac De Rivaz with an atmospheric internal combustion
engine, ran on hydrogen.

However, balloons were almost the only use of hydrogen for 200 years (apart from
applications in chemical laboratories2 or industry for the production of methanol,
ammonia, etc.), until the Hindemburg disaster (1937) ended its use in lighter-than-
air machines, which have been since then inﬂated by helium. Since the 1960s it
became a widespread fuel for rocket engines, owing to the high speciﬁc impulse of
the hydrogen-oxygen propellant combination.

When burning hydrogen no carbon dioxide is produced and so no contribution to
the greenhouse effect can result. The exhaust is also much cleaner, with no unburnt
hydrocarbons, particulate and carbon monoxide. The only emissions can be related
to NOx .

2It should not be forgotten that also the very ﬁrst internal combustion engines, such as the prototypes
developed by Barsanti and Matteucci or by De Rivaz, ran on Hydrogen.

In the automotive ﬁeld hydrogen can be used in two different ways: burning it in

a more or less conventional engine or using it in a fuel cell to produce electricity.

At any rate hydrogen is not an energy source: although being by far the most
common substance in the universe, our planet does not contain any free hydrogen.
We can say that all the hydrogen available on Earth is either ‘already burnt’ (water) or
combined with a variety of other elements in many compounds. Energy is required to
extract hydrogen, and this energy is then given back when it is recombined. Hydrogen
is thus an energy accumulator, a sort of chemical battery.

The (conceptually) simplest way to produce hydrogen is by electrolyzing water,
but this requires huge quantities of electric energy. An electrolytic cell plus a fuel
cell forms what is usually called a reversible fuel cell, that is a sort of rechargeable
battery, with a disadvantage that it requires intermediate storage of hydrogen, which
is something not easy at all, as it will be seen later. Water can be decomposed also by
heat, but the temperature at which it spontaneously dissociates is around 2500 ◦C, too
high for industrial applications of thermolysis. Catalysts can be used to reduce this
temperature. The sulphur-iodine cycle is promising for producing hydrogen from
water in high temperature nuclear reactors.

Actually just about 3% of hydrogen is at present produced by electrolysis, while
the remainder is obtained from chemical reactions involving a fossil fuel, like natural
gas, carbon or oil. A common approach is steam reforming, in which steam reacts at
high temperature (700–1100 ◦C) with methane:

The carbon monoxide reacts again with water at about 130 ◦C, yielding:

CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2.

CO + H2O → CO2 + H2.

This way of producing hydrogen has an energy efﬁciency of 80%, so that when
hydrogen is burned to produce energy, less energy is obtained than it would by
burning methane directly. These reactions produce large quantities of carbon dioxide,

22.3 Automotive Fuels

185

and overall the quantity of greenhouse gases is larger when methane is transformed
into hydrogen and burned than when it is burned directly (at equal thermal energy
produced by the combustion). If the hydrogen is used in a fuel cell, and if the efﬁciency
of the system made up of the latter plus the electric motor is higher than that of the
thermal engine, then an improvement from this viewpoint may be obtained.

Other reactions of the same type can be used for different hydrocarbons, although
all of them produce huge quantities of carbon dioxide. There are however reactions
whose end product is not hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but hydrogen and carbon
black—which is however difﬁcult to store safely because of the danger that it burns
producing again carbon dioxide: operating in this way however, less than half of the
energy contained in the original hydrocarbons is at the end contained in the hydrogen.
A good quantity of energy ends up in the carbon, and cannot be extracted without
producing CO2.

Quite promising is the production of biohydrogen, i.e. the conversion of biomass
and biological waste into biohydrogen through biomass gasiﬁcation, steam reform-
ing or biological conversion like biocatalysed electrolysis or fermentative hydrogen
production. The latter involves the use of bacteria, through biolysis, photofermenta-
tion, dark fermentation, enzymatic hydrogen generation or biocatalysed electrolysis.
The simplest of these reactions is water photolysis

2H2O → O2 + 2H2

in which the required energy is suppled by sun light and which is the ﬁrst step of the
photosyntesys which occurs in all plants. Artiﬁcial photosynthesis is a predictable
way for the production of hydrogen and then of other fuels in the future.

As a result, a widespread use of hydrogen in vehicles makes sense only if the
primary source is different from fossil fuels: the true advantage of hydrogen is that
it transforms into a portable energy source those sources that are not portable, such
as nuclear energy, but also hydroelectric, solar, wind and other renewable sources.
In particular, the use of processes that do not pass through electric energy allow pro-
duction of hydrogen directly from nuclear energy, so allowing us to power vehicles
from nuclear energy in an indirect way.

Storage

The same feature that makes hydrogen so well suited to aerostatic applications,
namely its low density, is its main drawback in its applications as a fuel. When used
as a rocket propellant hydrogen is stored as a cryogenic liquid: its boiling temperature
at atmospheric pressure is about 20 ◦K, i.e. −253 ◦C. In these conditions its density
is just 71 kg/m3, i.e. 1/14 of the density of water. The size of the huge external tank of
the space shuttle was due to this reason; if it contained a hydrocarbon like kerosene it
would be about ten times smaller. Moreover, the liquid hydrogen tank must be ﬁlled
a short time before launch, and any time spent between ﬁlling and utilization causes
a severe boil-off of the fuel, with the ensuing waste and above all the risk of ﬁre,
owing to the high ﬂammability of the mixture of hydrogen and air.

186

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

In automotive applications it is possible to use liquid hydrogen, but the tank
must be a true insulated cryogenic tank, able to keep its content at a temperature
of −253 ◦C. It is practically impossible to insulate the tank well enough by passive
means to prevent boil-off and a slow evaporation must be taken into account, unless
active cooling is provided, a process that has its costs in terms of energy. Also the
difﬁculties of ﬁlling safely the tank with such a liquid are clear. Anyway, BMW
chose this way for the BMW Hydrogen 7 research car

An alternative is storing hydrogen as a gas in pressurized tanks. Bottles able to
keep a pressure of 350 or 700 bar are usually employed and even higher pressures
are under study. The density of hydrogen at 800 bar is 36.6 kg/m3, about half of its
density in liquid form at atmospheric pressure. The energy needed to compress the
hydrogen is not too large, but also not negligible, amounting to something like 2%
of the total energy content.

The safety problems linked with storing several kilograms of a highly ﬂammable
gas at such high pressures on board a vehicle are clear. Filling operations are difﬁcult
too, and time consuming, although faster than recharging the batteries of a battery
electric vehicle. Further increases of storage pressure would produce an increase of
the weight of the tank: an optimum between the decrease of the volume and the
increase of the wall thickness with increasing pressure must be sought.

To increase safety, the pressurized hydrogen tanks are made in three layers: a
polymeric, gas tight, inner one, a carbon ﬁber intermediate one, able to withstand the
internal pressure, and an outer layer able to protect the inner ones against mechanical
and corrosion damages. Several manufacturers such as GM, Honda or Nissan built
experimental vehicles in which hydrogen is stored in this way.

The two techniques can be combined in cryo-compressed storage devices: hydro-
gen is stored at cryogenic temperatures, but when it boils off it is initially not vented
and the pressure is allowed to rise up to about 350 bar, so that much less hydrogen
is lost, in particular if in the meantime the vehicle is used and the fuel is consumed.
Other approaches have been followed: they can be subdivided into chemical and
physical systems. In the most common chemical systems hydrogen is stored in metal
hydrides, such as MgH2, NaAlH4, LiAlH4, LiH, LaNi5H6, and TiFeH2, with varying
degrees of efﬁciency. Some of these hydrides are liquid at ambient temperature and
pressure, while others are solid. Their energy density by volume is usually good,
while their energy density by weight is usually worse than that of hydrocarbon fuels.
The problem with this kind of storage is that energy is required both to store and to
release the hydrogen from the hydrides. The weaker the bond of the hydrogen atoms
within the compound the more energy is required in the ﬁrst phase and the less in the
second, so that also here a compromise is required. The goal is a temperature lower
than 100 ◦C for release and a pressure lower than 700 bar for recharge. Catalysts can
help in these issues, but a satisfactory solution has not yet been found.

Hydrogen can be bound to form carbohydrates that can be stored in liquid or solid
form. Glucose, cellulose, starch, have been tested. Also synthetic hydrocarbons can
be used as hydrogen carriers, but the disadvantage is the need of a reformer on board
to extract the hydrogen from the compound, that makes the powertrain complex and
costly.

22.3 Automotive Fuels

187

Ammonia is a hydrogen carrier that is produced in large quantities and can be
burned in slightly modiﬁed gasoline automobile engines but at standard temperature
and pressure is a toxic gas with quite a bad smell. Other chemicals that can be used
as hydrogen carriers are amine borane complexes, formic acid, imidazolium ionic
liquids, phosphonium borate carbonite substances, etc.

Apart from cryogenic and compressed gas storage, which can be dubbed as storage
by physical means, other forms of physical storage of hydrogen exist. For instance,
hydrogen can be stored in nanostructured carbon, like carbon nanotubes, although
how much hydrogen can be stored in this way is still controversial. Other porous
materials, like metal-organic frameworks, glass capillary arrays, glass microspheres,
can store hydrogen, in particular at low temperatures.

The research is proceeding and new chemical and physical storage devices are
constantly found, but they all are a long way from being practical, safe and cost
effective energy storage devices. The very wide variety of the proposed methods
show that these technologies are still quite young and a long time may be required
to establish standard methods and techniques.

The various devices are characterized by a performance index, namely the ratio
between the mass of the contained hydrogen and the mass of the full tank (hydrogen
plus container). The American Department Of Energy (DOE) has stated a goal of
0.065 for this performance index, i.e. for every kilogram of hydrogen a tank of 14 kg
is required, but lower values are now considered as satisfactory, like the value 0.04
obtained with storage pressures of 450 bar. If all ancillary equipment, like pressure
and temperature control devices, etc. is considered, even lower values result.

The ratio between the mass of the hydrogen and the volume of the tank is about

70.6 kg/m3, roughly equal to the density of liquid hydrogen.

Utilization

As already stated, hydrogen is the cleanest fuel and can be used by burning it in
a more or less conventional engine or by having it to react with oxygen in a fuel
cell. The ﬁrst alternative is for sure the simplest one, since a conventional internal
combustion engine can be easily converted to hydrogen usage, but is characterized
by a low efﬁciency, since the chemical energy of the fuel must be ﬁrst converted
into thermal energy and then into mechanical energy and the efﬁciency of the latter
transformation has the limitations stated by the second principle of thermodynamics.
It must be remembered that most of the early experiments with internal combustion

engines in the nineteenth century were performed using hydrogen as fuel.

In a fuel cell the same reaction goes on without liberating thermal energy (or at least
too much thermal energy, since some fuel cells operate at high temperature, although
lower than that characterizing combustion) and chemical energy is converted directly
into electric energy. However, although there is no theoretical strict limitation to the
efﬁciency of this process, the efﬁciency of a fuel cell is much lower than the theoretical
100% maximum. Moreover, the electric energy must be furthermore converted into
mechanical energy in an electric motor, and the efﬁciency of this latter transformation

188

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

must be accounted for. The overall efﬁciency is between 20 and 50%, depending on
the type of fuel cell, motor and controller used.

As a conclusion, the problems with hydrogen vehicles provided with internal
combustion engines are mostly related with the storage of the fuel and the refuelling
techniques and facilities. Prototypes with satisfactory performance can be built and
have actually been produced and even a small series production is within the pos-
sibilities for the near future, particularly if the vehicle has dual fuel capabilities, so
that it can work on gasoline when no hydrogen supply is available. The problems
with large scale production and cost containment are however still to be solved and
above all it makes little sense to produce hydrogen as an energy medium to use in
internal combustion vehicles with the present mix of primary energy sources, even
in countries where the share of electric power generated by nuclear energy is large,
like in France (75.2%): It is much better to use fossil fuels for vehicles while using
different sources for producing electricity.

22.3.4 Production of Methane from Carbon Dioxide

It has already been said that automotive internal combustion engine can run on
methane, reducing CO2 emissions. But, if methane is directly produced from carbon
dioxide, burning it in car engines can be considered as a CO2 free process.

The reaction

CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O

was discovered by the French chemist Paul Sabatier in the 1910s. Hydrogen reacts
with carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures (about 300–400 ◦C) and pressures, in
the presence of nickel or of some other catalyst to produce methane and water.
New catalysts which reduce the amounts of energy required are actively studied: for
instance a catalyst similar to chlorophyll, which instead of producing oxygen from
CO2 produces methane using energy from the sun to break up the CO2 molecule into
carbon, which then combine with hydrogen to form methane and water, and oxygen.
Obviously the production of methane in this way requires energy, so methane can
be considered as an energy medium, like hydrogen as seen above. Notice that in the
Sabatier reaction also hydrogen must be produced and this requires energy too.

Carbon dioxide can thus be considered a resource, but one which is not easily
exploitable: obtaining it directly from the atmosphere is difﬁcult owing to its low
concentration, while it is much easier to obtain it from the smoke produced by com-
bustion, and in particular from some industrial plants like those to produce cement.
When obtained from carbon dioxide, methane can be considered a carbon-neutral
fuel, but only for an energy-rich society, like hydrogen, but with the difference that
it is much easier to store and transport and that the technologies to use it in internal
combustion engines are already there.

22.4 Internal Combustion Engines

As stated in the previous section, most road vehicles are powered by reciprocating
Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). The performance of an internal combustion
engine is usually summarized in a single map plotted in a plane whose axes are the
rotational speed (cid:2)e and either the power Pe or the engine torque Me (Fig. 22.5).
Often the former is reported in rpm, the power in kW and the torque in Nm.

If a plot of the power as a function of speed is used, the plot is limited by the
curve Pe((cid:2)e) expressing the maximum power the engine can supply as a function
of the speed. Such a curve is typical of any particular engine and must be obtained
experimentally. However, when building a simple model of the vehicle, it is possible
to approximate it with a polynomial, usually with terms up to the third power,

Pe =

Pi (cid:2)i
e

.

3(cid:2)

i=0

(22.2)

The values of coefﬁcients Pi can easily be obtained from experimental testing. In
the literature it is possible to ﬁnd some values of the coefﬁcients which can be used
as a ﬁrst rough approximation. M.D. Artamonov et al.3 suggest the values

for all types of internal combustion engines and

P0 = 0,

In these formulae (cid:2)max is the speed at which the power reaches its maximum

value Pmax .

At present, internal combustion engines for vehicular use are controlled by systems
of increasing complexity and their performance is increasingly dependent on the
control logic used. The power and torque maps are, then, not unique for a certain
engine but may be changed simply by modifying the programming of the electronic
control unit (ECU). If the above mentioned equations have always been just a rough
approximation, today the situation is even more complex from this point of view, and
in some cases the equations may supply results much different from those actually
observed.

If experimental results on a similar engine are available, it is possible to obtain

the maximum power curve from the power curve of that engine.

Remark 22.1 The practice of correcting engine performance in a way proportional
to the displacement is not correct, even if it is acceptable and often used for small
changes of capacity. A scaling parameter that may be more correct is the area of the
piston multiplied by the number of cylinders, that is, the ratio between capacity and
stroke.

The mean effective pressure pme, i.e., the ratio between the work performed in a
complete cycle and the capacity of the engine, is often used instead of the torque. In
four-stroke engines it is deﬁned as

pme = 4π Me
V

,

(22.5)

where V is the total capacity of the engine.

All points below the maximum power curve are possible working points for the

engine, when it operates with the throttle partially open.

Remark 22.2 Since the engine is seldom used at full throttle, usually only when
maximum acceleration is required, the conditions of greatest statistical signiﬁcance
are those at much reduced throttle.

Fig. 22.4 Map of a direct injection diesel internal combustion engine of about 2 L capacity, with
constant speciﬁc fuel consumption curves. The circles show the points where the engine operates
on the NEDC driving cycle (Directive 1970/220) for computing fuel consumption with a car with
a reference mass of 1600 kg. The consumption of this engine at idle is about 0.62 l/h

A diagram of the speciﬁc fuel consumption of a direct injection diesel engine with
a capacity of about 2 L is shown in Fig. 22.4; on the same plot, the circles show the
points at which the engine operates on the NEDC driving cycle (Directive 1970/220)
for computing fuel consumption for a car with a reference mass of 1600 kg.

The percentages shown close to the circles refer to the time the engine is used in
the conditions related to their centers, with reference to the total time the engine is
producing power (the time at idle is then not accounted for); the center of the circles
represents the average of all utilization points in a rectangle with sides of 500 rpm
on the speed axis and one bar on the pme axis.

The curves below the one related to the maximum mean effective pressure in
the plot of Fig. 22.4 are those characterized by various values of the speciﬁc fuel
consumption q. The correct S.I. units for the speciﬁc fuel consumption, the ratio
between the mass fuel consumption (i.e., the mass of fuel consumed in the unit time)
and the power supplied, is kg/J, i.e. s2/m2, while the common practical units are still

192

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

g/HPh or g/kWh. If the thermal value of the fuel is equal to 4.4 × 107 J/kg, it follows
that

q = 2.272 × 10−8

ηe

kg/J = 60.16
ηe

g/HPh = 81.79

g/kWh,

where ηe is the efﬁciency of the engine.

This map allows the fuel consumption of the engine to be stated in various working
conditions: at far left is the minimum speed at which the engine works regularly; at
far right is the maximum speed. The speed axis shows conditions at idle, where the
mean effective pressure ( pme) vanishes together with the efﬁciency and the speciﬁc
fuel consumption is inﬁnite.

The map can be represented in a different way, plotting power on the ordinates
and using the efﬁciency ηe of total energy conversion, from chemical energy of the
fuel to mechanical energy at the shaft, as a parameter.

A plot of this type is shown in Fig. 22.5.

Remark 22.3 The efﬁciency of a spark ignition engine reaches its maximum in con-
ditions close to full throttle and at a speed close to the one where the torque is at its
maximum. The efﬁciency decreases quickly as power is reduced at a ﬁxed speed.
This decrease is less severe in diesel engines.

Efﬁciency and speciﬁc fuel consumption are linked by the relationship

q = 1
H ηe

(22.6)

where H is the thermal value of the fuel.

Example 22.1 Compute the coefﬁcients of a cubic polynomial approximating the
power versus speed curve of the engine of the vehicle in Appendix E.1. Compare the
curve so obtained with the experimental one and that obtained from the coefﬁcients
suggested by Artamonov. Plot on the same chart the engine torque and the speciﬁc
fuel consumption. By taking from the plot points spaced by 250 rpm and using a
standard least squares procedure, it follows that

P = −10.628 + 0.1506(cid:2) − 9.5436 × 10−5(cid:2)2 − 5.0521 × 10−8(cid:2)3,

where (cid:2) is expressed in rad/s and P in kW. Using Artamonov’s coefﬁcients for a
spark ignition engine, the equation becomes

P = 0.7024(cid:2) + 1.290 × 10−4(cid:2)2 − 2.369 × 10−7(cid:2)3.

The two curves are plotted in Fig. 22.6. Both expressions approximate the experi-
mental curve well, even if the coefﬁcients are quite different.

The shape of the equal speciﬁc consumption lines in the map is mostly determined
by the mechanical power needed to run the engine, shown in the lower part of the
diagram in Fig. 22.5; it can be easily observed that this power is strongly affected
by engine speed and is independent of useful power output. As a consequence, the
engine efﬁciency is roughly decreasing with speed, at the same useful engine output
and is roughly increasing with output at the same speed; empiric mathematical model

The torque and the speciﬁc fuel consumption are also reported as functions of speed

194

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

of the fuel consumption map can be obtained by interpolating the experimental data
according to these criteria.

Two more examples of engine maps for two spark ignition engines of about 2 L
capacity are reported in Figs. 22.7 and 22.8. The ﬁrst refers to an indirect injection
engine (in the intake manifold), while the second one is for a direct injection (in the
combustion chamber) engine. The latter is similar to the diesel engine shown earlier.
More examples can be easily found in the web.

Remark 22.4 When the fuel consumption is needed in points different from those
shown in the plot, it is advisable not to interpolate in the map of speciﬁc fuel con-
sumption, but on that of efﬁciency. The consumption changes in a strongly nonlinear
way with both speed and mean effective pressure, and tends to inﬁnity when the pme
tends to zero. The efﬁciency, on the contrary, tends to zero, when the pme tends to
zero.

22.5 Improving the Standard Powertrain

22.5.1 The Reciprocating ICE

The reciprocating internal combustion engine is conceptually more than a century old,
but it is still undergoing intensive research. In the past most research was concentrated
on improving its power density and in reducing its cost while improving reliability
and ease of use: the results have been outstanding. Now research is concentrated in
reducing pollution and fuel consumption.

Recently the standards for pollution and fuel consumption became more strict,
not only from the viewpoint of the goals but mainly from that of the way of measur-
ing the vehicle performances. In Europe the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC,
last updated in 1977) was substituted on September 1st 2017 by the Worldwide
harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) and the emissions are no more
measured in the lab but directly on the road in tests performed in actual conditions
(Real Driving Emissions test, RDE).

196

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

The main lines for reducing fuel consumption are downsizing, downspeeding and

friction reduction.

Downsizing implies using engines with a smaller displacement and fewer cylin-
ders, but with the same power of the original engine thanks to direct injection and
turbocharging. The engine can be operated at a slower speed, so that the friction
losses are lower (downspeeding) and, to achieve the same goal, the mechanical con-
ﬁguration of the engine is modiﬁed. For instance, the friction may be reduced by
substituting the conventional hydrodynamic bearings of the crankshaft with ball or
roller bearing, a thing wich is made since a long time in some single cylinder motorcy-
cle engines or some special engines, but was considered impossible in multi-cylinder
car engines. A simple solution may be to substitute the front bearing with a rolling
element bearing, while maintaining all other bearings of the conventional type: this
mixed approach allows to substantially reduce the friction due to the rotation of the
crankshaft, particularly in engines in which the front bearing is much loaded due to
the use of a belt-driven starter engine-alternator allowing to perform start and stop
operation or a mild hybridization with recuperation of part of the braking energy,
without making the engine architecture much complicated and incurring into noise
problems. Further contribution to the reduction of mechanical friction losses could
come from running the engine ancillaries, such as oil pump, water pump, air condi-
tioner compressor, etc. at their optimum speed, thanks to an electrical drive, instead
of the conventional belt drive that causes these components to rotate at a ﬁxed ratio
with the engine speed independently of the output matching the needs. Another way
to reduce mechanical losses is to control the engine torque by changing intake valve
timing, instead of throttling the intake air, with consistent reduction of pumping
losses at low torque.

Each one of these provisions allows to reduce marginally the power losses, but

when they are all added together the overall fuel saving may be substantial.

As mentioned, another point is to control the engine valves individually, in such a
way to improve the efﬁciency of the engine in the various conditions and at the same
time to reduce the emission of polluants. The idea is not new, but only recently this
approach became possible thanks to new hardware conﬁgurations (camshaft, rockers,
followers, etc.) and actuators, electrohydraulic or electro mechanical, controlled by
a microprocessor. The efﬁciency of the engine can be improved also in other ways,
like using a variable compression ratio, which can be done by using a counter piston,
so that the cylinder head can be moved or in other ways, by substituting the simple
crank-connecting rod mechanism with a multilink mechanism able to adjust the
stroke of the piston.

An example of these practices could be the Miller cycle engine,4 now introduced
in car engines by some manufacturer. By acting on intake valve timing is it possible
to have a compression stroke reduced in comparison to the expansion stroke. While
only the latter inﬂuences engine efﬁciency through the expansion ratio, a reduction
of the former can reduce the compression ratio when unnecessarily high (for instance
at low torque) with positive effect on both friction and pumping losses. Figure 22.9

4The Miller cycle was patented in 1957 by Ralph Miller, an American engineer.

pme when compared with Fig. 22.8.

Modern engines can be controlled in an ‘intelligent’ way, to reduce fuel consump-

tion. In particular:

• the engine can be stopped completely when the vehicle does not require power
(start and stop cycles). This can be performed by using the conventional starter
motor which drives the engine through a gear wheel usually located on the engine
ﬂywheel, or using an electric motor driving the engine through a belt which is
always engaged. In the second case, the motor can be used as a generator to recover
some braking energy to recharge the battery or can be also used in a hybrid mode.
In most cases, when the electric motor starts the engine through a belt, a standard
started motor is also present to preform cold starts;

• some cylinders can be deactivated when the power required is much lower than
the power the engine can supply with good efﬁciency. This can be performed by
deactivating always the same cylinder (static deactivation; in a 3 cylinder engine
this corresponds to virtually reducing the engine capacity by 1/3) or changing
cyclically (rolling cylinder deactivation, with a larger equivalent capacity reduc-
tion).

These ways of controlling the engine require also deep changes in the engine
mechanical design. For instance, if the engine works in a start and stop way, using
the starter motor implies that the latter must be designed with a much larger number of
working cycles in mind and the battery must be appropriately dimensioned. Starting
the engine through a belt causes a much larger load on the bearings due to the belt

198

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

pull, which in turns means larger bearing friction, and so on. To avoid these losses,
the tensioner of the belt is usually designed in such a way that the pull on the belt
varies depending on the working conditions of the engine, something which requires
sensors, actuators, and a microprocessor-based controller.

Even larger is the effect of cylinder deactivation: working in this mode, causes a
strong increase of crankshaft torsional vibration, which in turn compels to introduce
torsional vibration dampers, which in the past were used mainly on diesel engines,
and today tend to be used in all engine types. An old idea, such as the Centrifugal
(or rotating) Pendulum Absorber CPA, no more used since the end of the 1940s, has
been resumed and new types of dampers like the double mass ﬂywheel have been
introduced.

As a result, internal combustion engines are becoming increasingly complex, but
at the same time they are also becoming much better, particularly for what pollution
and fuel efﬁciency, and thus greenhouse gases emissions, are concerned.

22.5.2 Transmission

Manual transmissions are quite simple, but they too can undergo reﬁnements mostly
aimed to improve their efﬁciency and thus to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse
gases emissions.

A ﬁrst point is reducing bearing losses. In the case of transmissions, all bearings
are already rolling elements (ball, roller or needle) bearings, but also in this ﬁeld
reﬁnements are possible. For instance, while it is known that ball bearings produce
much less friction than roller bearings of the same diameter and running at the same
speed, and particularly than conical roller bearings, it is also known that, at equal
diameter, the latter can withstand larger loads than the former. So substituting roller
bearings for ball bearings may allow to reduce their size—or better, the Dn (diameter
× angular velocity) product—so that to obtain a lower bearing drag. New types of
bearings have recently been designed which minimize their drag in the conditions
encountered in automotive transmissions: angular roller bearings, for instance, are a
recent improvement with respect to conial roller bearings. Clearly the fuel consump-
tion reduction which can be achieved by optimizing each bearing is small, but the
number of bearings which is present in a gearbox is fairly large and so the overall
effect is not negligible. Moreover, the approach is that of adding together the small
reductions obtainable by improving several elements, to obtain important overall
effects.

Also the clutch is undergoing improvements, both in design and in the way it
is controlled. Dual clutches are already becoming increasingly common, like auto-
matically controlled clutches which are particularly important in the case of hybrid
vehicles where deciding the exact moment in which the clutch disengaes and engages
is very important for energy recovery and saving. In case of automatic clutches the
actuators and their controllers are quite important.

22.5 Improving the Standard Powertrain

199

Considering again Fig. 22.4, we can notice that most of the life of a car ICE is
characterized by very low pme and consequently high speciﬁc fuel consumption: on
this situation a strong inﬂuence is exerted by the transmission ratios that are available
in the gearbox and are actually used by the driver. A considerable fuel consumption
reduction could occur using higher transmission ratios: Almost every circle appearing
on this diagram could be shifted to a lower fuel consumption position by reducing
the engine speed, according to a constant power transformation.

Pe = pme · (cid:2) = constant

In fact this kind of transformation causes each circle to move on the diagram along
an equilateral hyperbola to a higher efﬁciency area; this condition can be obtained by
using higher transmission ratio also at low speed; this explains why the most recent
gear boxes have been designed with an increased number of speeds (from 3 in the 1940
to 6 in the 2000 for manual gear boxes). Higher number could be still beneﬁcial but
will cause an increased number of shifts that could be unacceptable for the driver; on
the contrary they could be easily managed by an electronically controlled automatic
transmission; this fact explains why modern automatic transmission are provided by
up to 9 different transmission ratios or are continuously variable.

Automatic transmissions are still based mostly on torque converters, which in the
past were characterized by a fairly low efﬁciency. This can be improved and much
work is done, both on the ﬂuid dynamic design of the impeller and the turbine and on
the way of operating of the converter which must be prevented to work in conditions
in which the input and output shafts are almost rotating at the same speed with a
low efﬁciency. A clutch locking together the two shafts is used since long time, but
improvements are possible also in this ﬁeld. Again, increasing the number of gear
ratios allows to optimize the working conditions of the engine with a non-negligible
reduction of fuel consumption. Quite long transmission ratios can be used when
travelling at high speed on motorways: this is important since the maximum speed
is often much higher than the speed limitations on most motorways and thus it is
possible to proceed at speed close to the speed limit with the engine turning at quite
a low speed (downspeeding) using long transmission ratios: the effect is something
recalling the coasting—or sailing—strategy used on hybrid vehicles.

Dual clutch automatic transmissions, i.e. transmissions based on the conﬁguration
of manual gearbox, with friction clutches instead of a torque converter, are a solution
to the problem of improving the efﬁciency of automatic transmissions. The fuel
consumption reduction is high, because it combines the high efﬁciency of manual
transmissions with the possibility of having the engine working always in optimized
conditions.

Also Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) are being developed with the

same goals.

22.6 Innovative Engines

Many proposals have been put forward in the past to radically change the type of
engine used in motor vehicles and in particular in cars. The proposed alternatives
came from many sources, but most of them could be summarized in the following
trends:

• Internal combustion engines:

– gas turbines,
– rotary piston engines.
• External combustion engines

– steam engines,
– hot gas engines.

None of these proposals had any practical success for a number of reasons. For
sure one of them is the fact that standard reciprocating engines beneﬁtted from a long
history of development and a huge cumulative investment in research. The issue of
whether any of the solutions above (or one of the others that may be conceived)
could be the most successful engine type if it had the same century long history
of development and improvements is questionable, and after all it is also of little
interest. In the actual world things went as they did, and the engines we now have
are the result of this development. The only things we can document are the reasons
that caused the failure of these attempts.

22.6.1 Internal Combustion Engines

Gas turbines were regarded in the 1950s as a natural candidate to substitute reciprocat-
ing engines in vehicles, like they did in aircraft and helicopters, owing to their higher
speciﬁc power and absence of reciprocating parts, which results in a smoother running
and, at least in part, higher reliability and longer lasting. Turbines, particularly small
ones, are much faster than reciprocating engines (the turbine of the 1963 Chrysler
Gas Turbine Car, Fig. 22.10a, had a top speed of 44,500 rpm), implying a more com-
plicated transmission. Moreover, they were much more difﬁcult to control, at least
when these attempts were made (presently, owing to simple microprocessor-based
controls, miniaturized gas turbines were successfully built), their fuel consumption
is higher and their acceleration performance is poor. When the oil crisis broke out,
their high fuel consumption stopped all attempts in this area and the many prototypes
most manufacturers built in the 1960s were scrapped or ended in museums.

Now it is possible that gas turbines will make their comeback in the automotive
industry for hybrid vehicles. In fact, modern ceramic materials and control technology
allow miniaturization of this kind of engine, the possibility of coupling it directly
with very high speed generators allows us to dispense with a transmission (small

turbojet and turboprop units used in model airplanes turn at 160,000 rpm or more,
are low cost and fairly simple to use, although their life is too short for automotive
application), there is no acceleration problem and above all their power density is
high and their efﬁciency, up to 40%, is better than that of diesel engines, and not
much lower than that of fuel cells, while accepting a variety of fuels. Jaguar has built
an interesting prototype of a turbine-powered hybrid car (Fig. 22.10b).

Rotary piston engines, like the Wankel engine, were introduced in the 1950s in
the automotive ﬁeld and had initially some success. Their main advantage is their
compactness and smooth running, owing to the lack of reciprocating parts, but they
have always been plagued by several problems, such as the wear of the rotor seals.
Although from time to time some non automotive application resurfaces, after the
oil crisis and the environmental laws their higher fuel consumption and the difﬁculty
in complying with emissions regulations caused them to disappear from cars. In this
case a comeback is unlikely.

22.6.2 External Combustion Engines

Steam engines were used to power road vehicles in the nineteenth century and at the
beginning of the twentieth, when their use was discontinued. The idea of returning to
steam engines was revived during the oil crisis of the 1970s: the rationale was that an
external combustion engine can burn any kind of fuel in its boiler and the control of
emissions is easier in a continuous combustion than in an intermittent one. The usual
advantage of not needing a clutch and a gearbox with several transmission ratios and
the drawback of requiring some time to build up steam pressure were not considered
very important at that time, if compared with the issues of fuel consumption and
emissions.

Several studies were done, but little reached the prototype stage. Sophisticated
steam engines, with superheaters and other complex devices reached high values of

202

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

efﬁciency, and as recently as 2006 an Automotive Engineering International Techni-
cal Award was given at the SAE World Congress in Detroit to Cyclone Technologies
LLP, developer of steam engines for automotive applications. Their claim is that their
engine has a 30% efﬁciency.

With respect to better controlling emissions and using a variety of fuels, hot air
engines have the same advantages as steam engines. They can be based on different
thermodynamic cycles; the ones usually considered are closed cycles like the Stirling
cycle (an engine that incorporated an innovative regenerator, then dubbed Econo-
mizer, patented in 1816 and built in 1818) or the Brayton cycle. Their advantage is
high efﬁciency, and for this reason they were several times proposed for automotive
applications but their low power density, both referred to the engine mass and vol-
ume, discouraged practical applications. Their use in extending the range of battery
electric vehicles has however been attempted.

22.7 Electric Motors

Different types of electric motors can be used for vehicular traction, and traditionally
multi-phase induction alternating current (AC) motors and Direct current (DC) brush
motors were the most common type. The availability of efﬁcient and relatively low
cost power electronics allowed to use a different type of electric motors in vehicular
applications: Permanent Magnets Brushless Motors (PMBMs). They are physically
similar to the AC synchronous motors, but they are fed through an inverter in such a
way that the feeding frequency matches exactly the speed of the rotor of the motor.
Considering the system made by the power conditioner—the inverter—and the motor,
the system can be considered as a DC motor and, since they have no brushes, they
are called PMBMs.

Using an inverter with a feedback control, it is possible to drive also induction
motors from a DC source with high efﬁciency, so both PMBMs and induction motors
are used in electric vehicles, although the former are often preferred and are generally
used in hybrid vehicles. While induction motors need only a velocity sensor, the
inverter feeding brushless motors need to know with precision the position of the rotor
and, as a consequence an absolute encoder is generally used. The sensor performing
this task can be an optical encoder, an electromagnetic sensor or a magnetic sensor,
like Hall effect sensors. However, it is possible to measure the Electro Motive Force
(EMF) in the coils to infer the rotor position, without the need for separate sensors:
this arrangement is often called sensorless. Since sensorless motors use the back EMF
to detect the position of the rotor, they have difﬁculties in starting and operating at
low speed and need at any rate a physical sensor. Not only sensorless layouts but
also Hall effect sensors may have difﬁculties in low speed operation, and this is
particularly important when using torque motors with the aim of avoiding the need
of a mechanical transmission, by driving directly the wheels.

22.7 Electric Motors

203

On the contrary, the stators are completely different because brushless motors are
based on permanet magnets, while the rotor of induction machines contain only the
iron laminations and a shorted electric circuit—like the squirrel cage in rotors based
on this geometry.

The convenience of using a motor of one type or the other depends of many factor,
and in general brushless motors are preferred for the smaller size applications and
mostly for hybrids, while induction motors are preferred in the larger Battery Electric
Vehicles (BEMs).

Since there are no windings on the rotor, there is no need to transfer an electric
current to rotating parts. The introduction of high performance permanent magnets
(rare-earths magnets) at the end of the twentieth century and their decrease in cost
in the following years contributed to the diffusion of PMBM.

With respect to the traditional brush motors, DC brushless motors are more efﬁ-
cient and have a longer life, apart from being less costly for what the motor is
concerned, while brush motors do not need an inverter and so can do without a costly
power electronics.

The most common conﬁguration is that with the rotor inside the stator (Fig. 22.11a),
but there are cases in which the rotor is placed outside (Fig. 22.11b, outrunner
motors). Since the radius of the airgap is larger, for a given size of the motor, outrun-
ner motors, supply a larger torque than inner-rotor motors, and thus this conﬁguration
is often used in torque motors. However, they have also some disadvantages, like the
difﬁculty of achieving sufﬁcient cooling: since both the losses in the iron and in the
copper occur in the stator, almost all the heat is produced in the latter and in outer
rotor motors it is less easy to get rid of the heath produced.

In both conﬁgurations the air gap is crossed by a magnetic ﬁeld whose direction is
radial. Another possible conﬁguration is that with the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂowing through
the air gap in axial direction (Fig. 22.11c). Such axial ﬁeld motors are usually much
thinner and of greater diameter, for a given mass, than radial ﬁeld motors and thus
they supply larger torques and lower speeds. Being large and thin, they are called
pancake motors.

The controller is usually based on a microprocessor to operate the 3 bidirectional
drivers feeding the various phases of the windings. The computational power of the

various voltages for the same motor

microcontroller is usually large enough to control not only the speed, but also the
acceleration and, if required, the rotor position. It is possible to use the controller
also to ﬁne tune the relevant parameters to achieve the best possible efﬁciency in the
various operating conditions.

From the viewpoint of the input–output relationship, a brushless motor is identi-
cal to a permanent magnets conventional DC motor. Its equivalent electric circuit is
shown in Fig. 22.12a, where R and L are the equivalent input resistance and induc-
tance, V is the voltage across terminals and VB is the back EMF, all referred to the
active commutated phase.

The latter is proportional to the angular velocity (cid:2) of the motor, through the back

EMF constant K B

VB = K B(cid:2),

which can be expressed in V/(rad/s) = Vs or in V/rpm (the latter not being a consistent
SI unit).

The torque produced by the motor is proportional to the current i through the

torque constant K T

T = K T i,

which is usually expressed in Nm/A.

If expressed in consistent units, their units are the same (V/(rad/s) = Nm/A), and

the numerical values of K B and K T are equal.

In steady-state conditions, from the equivalent circuit in Fig. 22.12a it follows that

the voltage V is linked with the torque and the speed by the relationship

where the ﬁrst term is the voltage required to produce the torque and the second the
voltage required to overcome the back EMF.

Solving this equation in (cid:2) yields the speed-torque characteristic of the motor at

constant voltage:

(cid:2) = V
K B

− T R
K T K B

.

The speed-torque characteristic is plotted in a qualitative way in Fig. 22.12b: it is
a straight line. The maximum speed the motor can reach is achieved when it supplies
no torque. The no-load speed is

(cid:2)max = V
K B

.

Tnl = K T V
R

.

The maximum torque is obtained when the motor stalls, i.e. its speed is reduced

to zero

Once the speed-torque characteristic has been computed, it is possible to obtain
the mechanical power Pm. The electric power Pe and the efﬁciency η of the motor

Pm = (cid:2)T , Pe = V i , η = Pm
Pe

.

The plot of Fig. 22.12b is however only an ideal one: the part on the right cor-
responds to conditions where the motor should work with large torques, and hence
large currents, and low efﬁciency. Most of the electric power is thus used not to
produce mechanical power but to produce heat and these operating conditions can be
sustained only for a very short time, if at all. For thermal reasons the maximum cur-
rent a motor can sustain is limited to a value well below the value V /R corresponding
to the torque Tnl. The maximum continuous torque is thus

Tmax = K T imax .

(22.14)

When the motor does not rotate, the back EMF is zero and connecting the motor
at standstill causes a very large current to ﬂow in it, producing a very large torque.
In the case of an ideal motor, R = 0 and thus at standstill it is equivalent to a short
circuit, with the current and the torque tending to inﬁnity. Certainly the fact that
at low speed the current and the torque are very large is important in automotive
applications, but compels to set a voltage limitation when starting: the voltage must
be controlled so that the torque does not exceed a maximum value, i.e. the current is
limited. The maximum voltage at standstill is

V = Tmax R
K T

.

(22.15)

206

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Then the motor accelerates and voltage than may be increased but only to a point,

so that the torque remains below the maximum value

V = Tmax R
K T

+ K B(cid:2).

(22.16)

Often there is also another limitation: between the low torque, high speed con-
ditions where the performances are limited by the voltage and the low speed, high
torque conditions where the limitation comes from the current, there is an interme-
diate range where the limitation comes from the maximum power. The curves at
constant power are hyperbolas in the (cid:2)(T ) plane.

In current-limited conditions, while the speed increases, the mechanical power

Pm = T (cid:2) increases until it reaches a maximum value Pmax , at the speed

Above this speed the motor works in power limited conditions, so that the maxi-

mum value of the voltage is

((cid:2))

Pmax

= Pmax
T

.

V = Pmax R
(cid:2)K T

+ K B(cid:2).

(22.17)

(22.18)

In the analysis above, no account has been taken for mechanical energy dissipation
that occurs in the motor, such as bearing and seal drag. If this approximation is
dropped, the torque T produced by the current i can be written as

T = K T i = Tu + TD,

(22.19)

where Tu is the useful torque produced by the motor and TD is the drag torque, which
as a ﬁrst approximation can be assumed to be constant, but more often is considered
to be proportional to the speed (cid:2) like a viscous torque.

The mechanical power produced by the motor in this case is

Pm = (cid:2)Tu = (cid:2) (T − TD) .

(22.20)

The same equations can be used also to describe the behavior of the motor when
works as a generator, remembering that in these conditions the torque, the current
and the power are negative and the efﬁciency can be deﬁned as

η = Pe
Pm

.

(22.21)

At low speed the EMF is lower than the voltage drop in resistor R, particularly
if the generator is requested to supply a large braking force. The minimum speed at
which it is possible to generate power (i.e., to recover braking energy) is

22.7 Electric Motors

(cid:2)min =

|T | R K T
K B

.

207

(22.22)

At a lower speed it is still possible to use the motor as a brake, by feeding it
with a voltage with opposite polarity, but no energy is recovered in this way—on the
contrary energy is spent—and much heat is generated. The use of mechanical brakes
is thus required at low speed.

As already stated, the above equations hold only in steady state conditions, so that
any speed variation is so slow that the derivative with respect to time of the various
quantities can be neglected. If the steady state assumption is dropped, in dynamic
conditions, Eq. (22.9) becomes

V = i R + L

+ VB

dt

(22.23)

and the relationship linking the torque with the speed is

T = (JM + JL )

+ TD + Te ,

(22.24)

d(cid:2)

where JM and JL are the moments of inertia of the motor and the load (the latter
reduced to the motor shaft), TD is the total mechanical drag torque and Te is the
torque opposing the motion applied to the load, also reduced to the motor shaft.

By introducing a total moment of inertia and a total drag torque, the latter being

a function of (cid:2) only (for instance, is like a viscous drag torque, linear in (cid:2)):

Jtot = (JM + JL ) , Ttot ((cid:2)) = TD + Te,

Consider as an example an automotive ‘pancake’ brushless torque traction elec-
tric motor having the following characteristics: maximum voltage Vmax p = 350 V,
equivalent resistance R = 0.75 (cid:2), torque constant K T = 5.013 Nm/A, back EMF
constant K B = 5.013 V/(rad/s), drag torque TD = 1 Nm; maximum rotational speed
(cid:2)max = 760 rpm = 79.6 rad/s, maximum torque Tmax = 300 Nm, maximum power
Pmax = 10 kW.

From the equations above it is possible to compute all the working parameters
of the motor—voltage, current, output power, electric power, efﬁciency—once the

208

Fig. 22.13 Efﬁciency map of a pancake torque motor

speed and the required torque are stated, it is thus possible to plot an efﬁciency map,
i.e. a contour plot of the surface η((cid:2), T ) (Fig. 22.13). In the upper part on the plot the
electrical machine works as a motor, while in the lower part it works as a generator.
By looking at this map and recalling again Fig. 22.4, we could conclude that also
electric traction motors for cars could beneﬁt from a gearbox with more than one
ratio, to avoid the motor to operate at low efﬁciency. The efﬁciency decay versus
speed is less severe and features an opposite behavior in electric motors than in ICEs
and this explains why most battery electric vehicle do not have any kind of gearbox;
nevertheless, when a gearbox is already present, as in plug-in hybrid electric cars,
it could be conveniently used in pure electric driving or in regenerative braking as
well.

The high performance of rare earths magnets, like neodymium-iron-boron mag-
nets, allows to build permanent magnets brushless motors with high power density.
They are well suited for automotive applications since they can operate efﬁciently at a
relatively low speed, like the motor of the example above. Motors able to supply high
torques at low speed are often called torque motors and are particularly interesting
in automotive applications, as well as in other ﬁelds, like robotics and in actuators
in general.

In the automotive ﬁeld a motor able to supply large torque at low speed can
be connected directly to the wheel without any reduction gear, which in general is

22.7 Electric Motors

209

still beyond actual possibilities: for instance, the motor of Fig. 22.13 coupled to a
wheel with a rolling radius of 400 mm allows to reach a velocity of only 31.84 m/s =
114 km/h, while supplying a low speed torque of 300 Nm, i.e. a traction of 750 N.
Much faster motors can be coupled to the wheels through a reduction gear, allow-
ing to supply a high starting torque at the wheels, but in many cases a variable
transmission ratio is required, like in the case of internal combustion engines, a thing
which makes it unpractical to put the motors directly into the wheels. Using a ﬁxed
ratio results in either a too low starting torque or in a too low maximum speed.

The mathematical model shown above is a fairly rough approximation because
it doesn’t take into account the various nonlinerities present in the actual machines,
(above all, assuming that the drag torque TD is constant is a particularly rough
approximation) and doesn’t take into account the losses in the power electronics.
The efﬁciency map of an electric motor can then be obtained experimentally, like
it was seen for internal combustion engines. An example for a ‘pancake’ traction
motor is shown in Fig. 22.14. The main characteristica are: maximum voltage: 800
V, continuous torque: 155 Nm, maximum torque 368 Nm, maximum speed 9,000
rpm, peak current 554 A, weight 35 kg, cooling: 50% water, 50% ethylene glycol.
Note the wide ﬁeld in which the efﬁciency is above 90%.

The design of electric motors for automotive applications has progressed much in
the recent years. For instance, since the limitations of electric motors mostly come
from the heating due to the high currents in the windings, liquid cooling of both the
motor and power electronics is at present commonly used. In this way it is possible to
improve the steady state performance, while a suitable thermal management system
allows to exceed steady state performances for short periods.

210

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Motors for automotive use are usually not stand alone units, chosen from a cata-
logue and assembled in a power unit: the motor is often supplied as a frameless unit,
containing only the stator windings, which may have a laminated core or be coreless,
and a rotor containing the permanent magnets, which are assembled into the case
and on the shaft so that it is fully integrated into the power unit.

Coreless motors have the advantage of being much lighter, having a greater efﬁ-
ciency (no losses in the iron) and displaying no cogging torque due to the interaction
between the magnets and the iron core.

To reduce the bulk and the mass of the power unit new geometrical conﬁgurations
have been developed: for instance, the coils made of copper wires just wound to form
a coil have quite large and heavy coil ends; this can be avoided with new geometries
like hairpin or wave windings, which are more complex but allow to pack a higher
power into a given space and a given mass.

22.8 Traction Batteries

As already stated, the motion of all vehicles requires the expenditure of a certain
quantity of mechanical energy, and in motor vehicles the system that supplies such
energy is on board: the engine must thus obtain the energy required for motion from
an energy source that is on board the vehicle. Rail vehicles often receive such energy
from outside during motion, but at present the only road vehicles in which this occurs
are trolleybusses.

In conventional vehicles, the energy is stored as the chemical energy of a fuel but,
alternatively, it can be stored in electrical batteries or in other storage devices, as was
shown in Table 22.1.

Bimodal and hybrid vehicles were deﬁned in Sect. 22.1, together with the possi-

bility of performing regenerative braking.

The power involved in braking is hardly manageable by the device that has to
convert the energy taken from the vehicle into usable energy, except in the case of
slowing down with limited deceleration at low speed: Decelerating at 1 g at 130 km/h
can involve a power that is about ﬁve times the power of the engine of a mid size
family car. In addition, this power must be transmitted to the road by all wheels,
while engines are usually connected to a single axle only.

Usually, to allow regenerative braking, there must be two braking systems, with
the traction motors (in the case of electric vehicles) providing regenerative braking
when slowing down or travelling downhill, while a conventional braking system
performs, in a non-regenerative way, emergency or sudden decelerations.

Although the only way of storing energy with a sufﬁcient energy density (other
than using a fuel) is in electrochemical batteries, the energy density and above all
the power density of the latter is still insufﬁcient to allow the large vehicle range
and ease of refuelling we are used to with fuel operated thermal engines. However,
owing to the progress of the last years in this ﬁeld, practical Battery Electric Vehicles
(BEVs) are not only possible, but are on the market and constitute a growing reality.

22.8 Traction Batteries

211

The ﬁrst wave of electric vehicles occurred at the end of the nineteenth and at
the beginning of the twentieth century, when BEVs were almost as common, at least
in the United States, as vehicles driven by internal combustion engines (together
with steam vehicles). They were based on lead-acid batteries, and later practically
disappeared, owing to the excessive recharging time and their limited range due to
the low energy density of this kind of batteries.

Electrochemical batteries are devices in which an electric current is generated as
a consequence of a chemical reaction occurring between two reactants. An example
of the electrochemical reaction is that taking place in lead acid batteries in which,
when fully charged, the anode is made of lead, the cathode is made of lead oxide and
the electrolyte is diluted sulfuric acid, in the form

H2SO4 → H+ + HSO−
4 .

During discharge, both plates turn into lead sulfate, releasing electrons at the

anode and getting electrons at the cathode. The reactions are:

Pb + HSO4 → PbSO4 + H+ + 2e−
Anode,
PbO2 + HSO4 + 3H+ + 2e− → PbSO4 + 2H2O Cathode,

i.e., as an overall reaction,

Pb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 → 2PbSO4 + 2H2O.

Like in all secondary (rechargeable) batteries, this chemical reaction is reversible
and can be run backwards by passing a current through the cell. This decomposes
the lead sulfate into lead and lead oxide, through the reactions

PbSO4 + H+ + 2e− → Pb + HSO4
Anode,
PbSO4 + 2H2O → PbO2 + HSO4 + 3H+ + 2e− Cathode.

This reversibility is never complete, like in all rechargeable batteries, and the
battery cannot be recharged an inﬁnite number of times: at every recharge the per-
formance of the energy conversion somewhat deteriorates until the cell cannot be
recharged any more. The performance of any battery depends on many factors and,
above all, its capacity is affected by how fast the charge and discharge process are
performed.

At present, the types of secondary batteries that are available or are predictable

for the near future are:

• Lead-acid cells. As already stated, they were used for almost all ‘old’ electric
vehicles and also the attempts to revive them were based mostly on batteries of
this kind. While in origin they were based on an open container full of electrolyte
(sulfuric acid), more modern types are sealed and provided with a valve to prevent
pressure build up. The electrolyte can be semi-solid (gel) or can be absorbed in a

212

special ﬁberglass matting. Their success is mainly due to their relatively low cost,
low maintenance, safety and easy handling, their manufacturing simplicity and
their interesting electrochemical features Their nominal cell voltage is 2 V.

• Nickel-based cells. A wide family of rechargeable batteries are based on nickel
chemistry, like nickel-cadmium (NiCd),5 nickel-iron (NiFe), nickel-zinc (NiZn),
nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) cells. They have a nominal cell voltage of about
1.2 V. Nickel-cadmium batteries are no longer legal, because of the ban on cad-
mium, while nickel-metal hydride batteries are becoming increasingly popular:
For the same weight, these batteries double the vehicle range, with respect to lead-
acid batteries at the disadvantage of a higher cost. Nickel-metal hydride batteries
are now considered a relatively mature technology. While less efﬁcient (60–70%)
in charging and discharging than even lead-acid batteries, their energy density is
in the range 30–80 Wh/kg, far higher than lead-acid. When used properly, nickel-
metal hydride batteries can have exceptionally long lives, as has been demonstrated
in their use in hybrid cars and BEVs. Some NiMH batteries are still operating
after travelling for 160,000 km in a decade. Drawbacks are, as already stated, their
poor efﬁciency, high self-discharge and poor performance in cold weather.
The reactions are:

OH− + MH → H2O + M + e−
Ni(OH)2

Anode,
+ H2O → Ni(OH) + OH− Cathode,

where the metal M in the negative electrode of a NiMH cell is an intermetallic
compound. Many different compounds have been developed for this application,
but those commonly used are of two types. The most common is AB5, where A
is a rare-earth mixture of lanthanium, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, and
B is nickel, cobalt, manganese, or aluminium. Some cells use higher-capacity
negative electrode materials based on AB2 compounds, where A is titanium or
vanadium, and B is zirconium or nickel, modiﬁed with chromium, cobalt, iron, or
manganese.6
The reaction during recharge is the same, read backwards.
NiMH cells have an alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide.

• Rechargeable alkaline cells. They are seldom considered for applications in which

a large quantity of energy has to be stored.

• Sodium-based batteries. Sodium–nickel chloride batteries, also called ZEBRA
batteries (from the acronym for Zero Emissions Batteries Research Activity),
sodium–sulfur (NaS), Na–NiCl, sodium-air batteries and the like operate at tem-
peratures between 200 and 350 ◦C. The tetrachloroaluminate NaAlCl4 (melting
point of 157 ◦C) elelectrolyte and the sodium negative electrode are molten at the
operating temperature (they are often called molten salt batteries). The positive
electrode is nickel in the discharged state and nickel chloride in the charged state.

5Actually NiCd is a proprietory name and should not be used to indicate nickel-cadmium cells in
general.

The batteries of this type have the advantage over the lithium batteries (see below)
that the basic raw materials used in their construction are much more common
and have a lower cost than lithium. Their basic drawback is that they operate at
higher temperature, and must be kept hot even when not operating—they typically
require 12 h to reheat and charge from cold state—, which leads to energy losses
which lower their overall efﬁciency.
They have a speciﬁc energy of 90 Wh/kg, a speciﬁc power of 150 W/kg and a
lifetime of over 1,500 cycles and ﬁve years. Even longer lifetimes (3,000 cycles
and 8 years) were obtained with small modules with 10 or 20 cells.
Batteries using Na–NiCl2 electrolyte, operating at lower temperature have been
built with energy densities up to 224 Wh/kg.

• Lithium-based cells. They include lithium-ion (Li-ion), lithium ion-polymer
(LiPo), lithium-iron-phosphate (LiPh) and lithium-sulfur (LiS) cells. In general
the electrodes are made of lithium cobalt (or manganese, or nickel or iron) oxide
and of carbon, in different forms. Lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries are
the most common in recent EV.
Almost all lithium polymer cells have a nominal voltage between 3.7 and 4.2 V.
The electrolyte is made by lithium salts in a liquid organic solvent or in a solid
polymer. The traditional lithium-ion batteries use a lithium cobalt oxide cathode
and a graphite anode. The basic reactions, referred to 1 mol (which explains the
coefﬁcient x), are:

LiCoO2 → Li1−x CoO2 + xLi+ + xe− Anode,
6C + xLi + xe− → Lix C6
Cathode.

The use of lithium-ion batteries provides a threefold increase in vehicle range for
the same weight.
Their energy density is as high as 200 Wh/kg or more, a good power density, and
a charge/discharge efﬁciency from 80 to 90%. Their drawbacks are a short cycle
life (hundreds to a few thousand charge cycles), a degradation with age and ﬁre
risks if punctured or charged improperly, so they require an accurately designed
Battery Management Systems (BMS).
The lithium based batteries used in electric vehicles often sacriﬁce energy and
power density to provide ﬁre resistance, environmental friendliness, very rapid
charges (as short as a few minutes), and very long lifespans, up to 10 years and
7000+ charge cycles.

As a general consideration, nickel based batteries have a larger self-discharge,
while lithium batteries are better from the viewpoint of quick charging and dis-
charging. The highest energy density, i.e. the ratio between stored energy and mass,
is obtained from lithium-sulphur cells that, however, have a short life in terms of
cycles. The main characteristics of some types of secondary batteries are reported
in Table 22.2; a plot of the mass energy density versus the volume energy density is
reported in Fig. 22.15.

Fig. 22.15 Mass and volume energy density for the main types of secondary batteries

The energy density and, even more, the power density of batteries is much
lower than those of gasoline or diesel fuel: for the energy density the ﬁgures are
30–200 Wh/kg against approximately 13,000 Wh/kg. In addition, liquid fuel tanks
can be ﬁlled in a matter of minutes, in comparison with the 4–8 h needed for electric
batteries. If a range of ∼120 km is deemed necessary to accomplish the daily mission
of a compact car, and this corresponds to an energy pack of 20 kWh, the mass of
the required lead-acid battery is 670 kg. This reduces to 330 kg with a NiMH battery
and to 170 kg with a Li-ion battery. This can be compared with about 10 kg of fuel,
computed assuming its use with an efﬁciency of just 15% (and assuming a 100%
efﬁciency for the electric motor).

22.8 Traction Batteries

215

The charge of any battery is critical, since the efﬁciency and the life of a battery
depends on how accurately the energy is introduced into the system. Some batteries
are less critical from this viewpoint, like lead-acid and NiCd cells, although the latter
display what is usually referred to as a memory effect, consisting in the tendency
to lose some of its capacity when recharged repeatedly after being only partially
discharged.

Advanced batteries are more critical, and may even become dangerous if not prop-
erly charged, with the risk of ﬁre and explosions. This is solved by using accurately
controlled, microprocessor-based, chargers. Battery packs are increasingly provided
with on-board electronics, normally deﬁned Battery Management Systems (BMS),
which monitor continuously the charge conditions and keep the current ﬂowing
through the various cells under control.

Generally speaking, batteries cannot be used at the same time at high power den-
sity and at high energy density: As already stated, when required to supply high
power (discharge with high current) the efﬁciency, and consequently the capacity,
decreases. They show also a reduction of their useful life when used in these con-
ditions. Lead-acid batteries are particularly sensitive to this, while some kinds of
nickel-cadmium and other more advanced batteries can operate with high currents,
both during charging (quick charge) and during discharge (high power output).

An ideal battery should be characterized by:

• High energy density,
• Almost constant voltage during discharge (a ﬂat discharge characteristics),
• Low internal resistance,
• High discharge current,
• Possibility of operating at both high and low temperatures,
• Long operating life and high number of charge-discharge cycles,
• High efﬁciency in recharge,
• Low cost.

No actual battery has particularly good performance in several of these points.
The voltage of a secondary battery decreases during discharge and the plot of
the voltage as a function of time is referred to as the discharge characteristics of the
cell. Initially there is a sharp drop from the maximum voltage, typical of the fully
charged state, to a lower value that is maintained, with a slight decrease, for most of
the discharge time. When the discharged conditions are approached there is a sharp
drop again. This third phase of the discharge curve must not be used: Discharges that
are too deep are detrimental to the possibility of fully recharging the battery and can,
in the long run, deteriorate it. The discharge curve is much inﬂuenced by how fast
the discharge is: if the current is large the voltage decrease in the intermediate phase
may be larger, depending on the battery type.

At present lead-acid batteries are largely used in the automotive industry, mostly
as starting batteries: according to a 2003 report,7 the batteries of vehicles on the
road contained an estimated 2,600,000 t of lead, for a yearly use of over 1,000,000 t.

7Getting the Lead Out, Environmental Defense and the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Mich.

216

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

This is made possible only by recycling the old lead from used batteries: in the United
States 97% of all battery lead was recycled between 1997 and 2001.8 A ﬁrst difﬁculty
regarding the diffusion of battery electric vehicles, if done by using conventional
lead-acid batteries, is the huge quantities of lead that are required. In 2010 a total of
4.14 Mt of lead were mined, and the total production of lead, including recycling,
was 9.602 Mt, out of which 71% was used for batteries for various applications.

Lead availability alone would rule out the possibility of converting to battery-
electric vehicles a substantial percentage of the vehicles at present on the road: The
huge increase of lead to be mined would push the price of this metal beyond what is
acceptable for the automotive use.

The situation is not much better with lithium batteries. The annual world pro-
duction of lithium and the estimated reserves are respectively 18,000 t and 9.9 Mt
(2009 data9): to equip 50% of the 72 million cars produced in 2007 with a lithium
battery containing just 1 kg of lithium each, a total of 36,000 t, twice the annual world
production, is needed.

The constant charging rate of a battery is usually expressed as xC, where x is a
number indicating the current in Amperes divided by the capacity in Ampere hours.
The charging time expressed in hours is so 1/x. With suitable power supplies, good
battery lifespan is usually achieved at rates not exceeding 0.5C, taking 2–3 h for
a full charge, but faster charging can be done. However, charging time is limited
by the current the grid connection can provide. A normal household outlet delivers
1.5 kW (in the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 110 V supply) or 3 kW
(in countries with 240 V supply), which means that the minimum charging time fron
a normal household supply is several hours. Fast charging from an household supply
requires a radical change of the home electric plant and in many countries also a
radical change in the pricing policy of the utilities. Fast charging requires a number
of public charging stations located in parking places, so that each one of them can be
used by many customers. Such high current chargers can charge, at least partially,
the battery of a BEVin 10–15 min.

Instead of directly plugging the cable to a socket in the car, charging can be
performed also through an inductive coupling or Inductive Power Transfer System
(IPTS) or Wireless Power Transfer System (WPTS), for instance by inserting a
special ‘paddle’ into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a transformer,
while the other is built into the vehicle. Inductive charging is particularly interesting
because it can allow to avoid having to perform manually the connection between
the charger and the car: the secondary winding can be located under the ﬂoor of the
car while the primary winding is located on the ﬂoor of the garage or under the road
surface, so that no contact can occur between a person and exposed conductors.

Apart from safety reasons, inductive charging can be performed even during the
motion of the vehicle, but, if the power transferred inductively is large enough, it
can be also powered directly from the mains, like a sort of trolleybus without trolley
(Roadway-Powered Electric Vehicle, RPEV or On-Line Electric Vehicle OLEV).

The idea is to have ‘charging highways’ so that a BEV can have a shorter range,
suitable for urban use, with an extension to short extra-urban travel, while in long
intercity travel the vehicle is recharged while travelling on the highway and reaches
the destination city with charged batteries. This could allow to substantially reduce
the installed battery capacity, and thus the weight of the vehicle, a thing which may
compensate for the lower charging efﬁciency linked with an inductive charging device
with a larger distance between the ﬁxed and the moving coils. The limit condition is
to have on board just enough battery capacity to travel on the road stretches which
have no charging devices.

Although the ﬁrst patent for a RPV dates back to 1894, this technology started
to be available for practical applications from 2010, and at present research and
experimentation on prototypes are proceeding. Values of the maximum efﬁciency
up to 94% have been reached.

The batteries installed in cars may be available for other uses when the vehicle
is not operating. For instance, during peak load periods the energy stored in parked
vehicles can be used as a distributed battery storage system to sell energy to the grid,
and conversely they can be recharged during off-peak hours at cheaper rates while
helping to absorb excess night-time generation. Clearly, the problem of the possibility
of managing the high currents by the distributed electric network remains. The energy
stored in parked cars can be used as a backup during blackouts. To make these things
possible, a ‘smart grid’ is required.

22.9 Supercapacitors

As already stated, the biggest problem with electrochemical batteries is more their
low power density than their low energy density. This is particularly felt in automotive
applications, when you want to obtain high accelerations but, above all, when you try
to recover braking energy. While electric motors can withstand easily and without
damage a short duration overload, batteries are damaged by overloads, even if they
last just for a short time. This compels to use brakes for high decelerations even
if there were electric motors able to convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle into
electric energy.

To improve things, it is possible to resort to an additional short term energy storage
device which can absorb the power peaks for a short time, to transfer then this energy
to the batteries in a way the latter can easily absorb it. Among the two devices which
have been commonly proposed, ﬂywheels and supercapacitors, the latter proved to
be more practical.

A supercapacitor (or supercap or ultracapacitor or Goldcap) is a capacitor whose
capacitance is much higher than that of conventional devices and are in a way an inter-
mediate solution between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They
typically store 10–100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic
capacitors, charge and discharge much faster and tolerate many more charge and
discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.

218

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Unlike ordinary capacitors, supercapacitors do not use the conventional solid
dielectric, but rather, they use electrostatic double-layer capacitance and electro-
chemical pseudocapacitance, both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the
capacitor, with a few differences:
• Electrostatic Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) use carbon electrodes or deriva-
tives with much higher electrostatic double-layer capacitance than electrochemical
pseudocapacitance, achieving separation of charge in a Helmholtz double layer at
the interface between the surface of a conductive electrode and an electrolyte. The
separation of charge is much smaller than in a conventional capacitor, of the order
of 0.3–0.8 nm,

• Electrochemical pseudocapacitors use metal oxide or conducting polymer elec-
trodes with a high amount of electrochemical pseudocapacitance additional to
the double-layer capacitance. Pseudocapacitance is achieved by Faradaic electron
charge-transfer with redox reactions, intercalation or electrosorption,

• Hybrid capacitors, such as the lithium-ion capacitor, use electrodes with differ-
ing characteristics: one exhibiting mostly electrostatic capacitance and the other
mostly electrochemical capacitance.

The electrolyte forms an ionic conductive connection between the two electrodes
which distinguishes them from conventional electrolytic capacitors where a dielectric
layer always exists, and the so-called electrolyte (e.g., MnO2 or conducting polymer)
is in fact part of the second positive electrode. Supercapacitors are polarized by design
with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied
during manufacture.

Combining these two storage effects, a capacitance of the order of 1–100 F can

be obtained.

teries id shown in Table 22.3.

A comparison between standard capacitors, supercapacitors and lithium-ion bat-

Electrolytic capacitors feature unlimited charge/discharge cycles, high dielec-
tric strength (up to 550 V) and good frequency response. Supercapacitors can store
10–100 times more energy than electrolytic capacitors but they do not support AC
applications. When compared with rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors feature
higher peak currents, low cost per cycle, no danger of overcharging, good reversibil-
ity, non-corrosive electrolyte and low material toxicity, while batteries offer lower
purchase cost, stable voltage under discharge, but they require complex electronic
control and switching equipment, with consequent energy loss and spark hazard in
case of a short.

22.10 Fuel Cells

The objective of building zero emission drive systems has spurred an increasing
interest in developing fuel cells for automotive applications. They are devices that
generate pollution-free electric energy by electrochemical reaction of hydrogen with
oxygen, producing water as a by-product.

Fuel cells were invented by Sir William Grove in 1839 but were developed in the
1960s for space applications, namely the Gemini and the Apollo missions and then
were widely used on the Space Shuttle.

Structurally, fuel cells are similar to batteries, however, unlike batteries, they do
not use previously generated electric energy. Powered by a fuel (hydrogen) and an
oxidant (oxygen), fuel cells generate electrical energy, and can run for as long as the
hydrogen fuel supply lasts, but are not rechargeable by electric energy. In this way,
the reaction between the fuel and the oxidizer is not a combustion process producing
heat that is later converted into mechanical or electric energy, but an electrochemical
reaction, producing directly electric energy. For this reason, the efﬁciency of fuel
cells can be higher than that of devices based on thermal engines.

A single hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell generates ∼0.8 V. Cells may be connected in
series, forming batteries able of powering an electric motor; in this case, the size of
the electric power package is comparable to that of the corresponding conventional
internal combustion engine, obviously not including the fuel (hydrogen) tank.

Theoretically, other fuels may be used, but most fuel cells are much sensitive to
poisoning by carbon monoxide and impurities, so that operating with fuels other than
hydrogen and with oxidizers other than pure oxygen, or in some cases by carefully
puriﬁed air, is problematic. This is one of the main reasons that makes the transfer
of fuel cell technology from the aerospace ﬁeld (where pure hydrogen and oxygen
are easily available and costs are much less of a problem) to the automotive ﬁeld so
difﬁcult.

220

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

The catalyst, the electrolyte and the membrane separating the electrodes may be
of different types, and consequently different types of fuel cells, each one with its
peculiar advantages and drawbacks for the different applications, exist.

• Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFC) use a liquid, corrosive, electrolyte and must be fuelled
by pure hydrogen and oxygen, since impurities in the fuel poison the cell. Their
efﬁciency is about 50%, or somewhat higher. They are used in space applications
since when they were developed for the Gemini missions; their building and oper-
ating cost is fairly low and they do not require complex ancillary equipment, but are
somewhat bulky. Hydrogen-oxygen alkaline fuel cells for space use are a mature
technology and need no speciﬁc research.

• Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) use a polymer electrolyte and
require pure hydrogen as fuel. Contaminants like sulfur compounds and carbon
monoxide poison the cell. Owing to their compact design and high energy density
they are suited for automotive use, but require complex and costly equipment,
like compressors and pumps, that use about 30% of the energy produced. That
notwithstanding, their efﬁciency is around 30%. They operate at low temperature,
about 80 ◦C.

• Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) use an electrolyte composed of a molten
carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix.
They are tolerant of the impurities in the fuel and can run on carbon monoxide.
Thus they accept different hydrocarbons like natural gas, that can be converted
to hydrogen and carbon oxides or gases made from coal. They operate at high
temperatures (650 ◦C), which reduces their useful life. The efﬁciency is about
60%, but can be increased up to 85% if the waste heat is reused.

• Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) use liquid phosphoric acid as electrolyte.
They are not affected by carbon monoxide impurities in the fuel. Their operating
temperature is 150–200 ◦C. Their efﬁciency is low (37–42%), but can be increased
if the waste heat is reused. They have a limited service life and use a costly catalyst.
• Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) use a solid oxide material as electrolyte. They
are not affected by poisoning from carbon monoxide and do not need high-cost,
platinum based, catalyst, but are affected by poisoning due to sulfur impurities.
The operating temperature is quite high, from 500 to 1,000 ◦C. Owing to the high
temperature, they can use methane, or butane or even liquid fuels that are externally
reformed. Their efﬁciency can reach 60%, and can be used for cogeneration of
electric power and heat. They can operate on light hydrocarbons such as propane
and methane without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only
partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow start-up time of these fuel
cells are problematic for automotive applications.

• Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC). They are similar to PEMFC, but use directly
methanol as a fuel. Their operating temperature is in the range of 50–120 ◦C, but
their efﬁciency is low, about 20%. They do not require a reformer, but provide
a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could
be counterbalanced by the much better volume energy densities of ethanol and
methanol over hydrogen. Bio-alcohol fuel is considered as a renewable resource.

22.10 Fuel Cells

221

If oxygen-hydrogen fuel cells are used, the reaction product is water, that can
be stored and again converted into oxygen and hydrogen by an electrolyzer. This
combination of fuel cell and electrolyzer is usually referred to as a regenerative fuel
cell, and in practice works as a rechargeable battery. No material is consumed (except
for some losses) and the system needs only energy.

Much research is at present devoted to fuel cells for vehicular application, both
for reducing their cost and for using different types of fuel. The choice of the fuel is
quite limited: an interesting alternative to hydrogen is methane, that is much easier
to store. If the lower energy density is not a problem, methanol or formic acid can
be used as liquid fuel. Recent developments have been aimed at experimenting with
direct methanol fuel cells where alcohol instead of pure hydrogen is injected into the
cell. Alcohol cells may solve the currently almost insurmountable problems arising
from large-scale use of hydrogen, at a cost of a low efﬁciency. The oxidizer is usually
at any rate oxygen.

Current objectives of fuel cell development programs for automotive applications
are reducing weight and volume while providing equal levels of available energy and
cutting costs.

Systems for storing the fuel (hydrogen) on board and in the supply network—
or for producing the fuel on board employing hydrocarbons—must be developed.
On-vehicle fuel storage is possibly the biggest problem when designing fuel cell-
powered vehicles. Several solutions are being considered, like storing hydrogen gas
in high pressure cylinders (∼300 bar) or in medium-pressure, very low temperature
cryogenic tanks. Alternatively, organic fuels (natural gas, methanol, gasoline, diesel)
could be suitably treated using on-vehicle systems, to extract the hydrogen needed
to fuel the cell pack. The latter approach has the difﬁculty of meeting the sudden,
instant demand for power during acceleration. A solution may involve the use of
auxiliary batteries to obtain the instant response needed, although this increases the
weight and size of the package.

The average tank-to-wheel efﬁciency of a fuel cell vehicle on a driving cycle like
the NEDC is about 36%, a value to be compared with 22% of a diesel vehicle, with
a maximum of the order of 45% at low loads. However, if the losses due to hydrogen
production, transportation, and storage are taken into account the 36% efﬁciency
reduces to a power-plant-to-wheel efﬁciency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as
high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as liquid hydrogen. At any rate, fuel cells
are efﬁcient relative to combustion engines, but are not as efﬁcient as batteries.

All major manufacturers produced demonstration prototypes with fuel cell pow-
ered drives. System architectures are very different and reﬂect the different points
of view of the various manufacturers and their research establishments. Essentially,
architectures fall within two large categories, namely electric-powered vehicles and
electric-heat engine powered hybrid vehicles.

Within each category, some manufacturers have opted for a pure hydrogen fuel
cell system (fuelled by hydrogen in gas or liquid form) while others are developing
organic liquid fuel systems (methanol, gasoline, etc.) using reformers to extract
hydrogen from the fuel. In this case, batteries are used to cope with power peaks
during accelerations.

222

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

This variety of solutions is proof of the current uncertainty surrounding devel-
opments in product technology and the feasibility of producing new fuels on an
industrial scale and distributing them through extensive networks.

Fuel cell powered vehicles will become a reality only if international agreements
will cause basic technology to converge toward the development of standardized
components and a common distribution network for the new fuel (pure hydrogen or
other). For obvious reasons, such developments must be seen as long-term projects
(∼30 years ahead or more).

A hybrid vehicle is a vehicle driven by at least two propulsion systems, where one
of them is reversible, in other words capable of driving the vehicle and recovering
the energy from the vehicle or from the ICE into the energy source, an accumulator
in this case. The most common hybrid system includes an ICE with its fuel tank,
as primary propulsion system, and an electric motor and its battery, as secondary
propulsion system; this solution is dominant in the automotive ﬁeld, and thus hybrid
vehicles are usually referred to as Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). Nevertheless
there could be also systems where the secondary propulsion system is made by a
hydraulic motor and a pressurized oil reservoir, by a pneumatic motor and a bottle
containing pressurized air or a continuously variable transmission connecting with a
ﬂywheel. In any case the existence of the secondary energy source is essential: i.e. a
system with an ICE with an electric transmission or with a hydrostatic transmission
cannot be considered a hybrid driveline.

The accumulator in a hybrid propulsion system is necessary to perform four
peculiar functions, outlined in Fig. 22.16 that shows how the fuel energy is spent and
how it can be saved or recovered by a hybrid propulsion system:

• store the kinetic energy of the vehicle during decelerations, instead of wasting as

heat in the brakes;

• store part of the potential energy of the vehicle during downhill driving, instead

of wasting as heat in the brakes;

• decrease the ICE inefﬁciency due to part load operation (engine optimal operation):
The ICE can work at part load with a torque higher than necessary to the desired
driving condition and the power in excess can be stored for driving later the vehicle
with the engine switched-off; in addition the engine can be stopped when the power
required to motion is very small or null (stop and go and sailing);

• allow ICE downsizing (engine optimization).

The two ﬁrst function are always beneﬁcial for reducing fuel consumption while
the third one is convenient only if the expected improvement in efﬁciency is not

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

223

Fig. 22.16 A hybrid propulsion system can recover the braking energy and the ICE inefﬁciencies
due to part-load operation

jeopardized by the charging-discharging efﬁciency of the accumulator. Let us take
as reference the fuel consumption map on Fig. 22.9: this engine offers a wide area of
minimum speciﬁc fuel consumption of about 225 g/kWh; if we imagine to recycle
its power to a battery with a charge/discharge efﬁciency of 0.85, using an electric
motor with a total efﬁciency of 0.9, we can conclude that it is convenient to recycle to
the battery when the speciﬁc fuel consumption of the engine alone would fall below
about 300 g/kWh. Looking at Fig. 22.4 we see that many clusters of operating points
exist below a level of this kind.

The idea of combining electric motors with internal combustion engines is not at
all new, but it was initially conceived as a mean to extend the range of an electric
vehicles rather than a system to reduce fuel consumption. The ﬁrst hybrid vehicle
was the Lohner-Porsche Semper Vivus (Fig. 22.17), built by Ferdinand Porsche from
a battery electric vehicle, the Elektromobil, and shown at the Paris Exhibition in
1901. The range was increased from 61 km to about 200 km, by installing two De
Dion-Bouton ICEs, driving each an electric generator; the peculiar design of this car
was characterized by two traction electric motors located directly in the front wheels.
While the most common accumulators able to store all the energy required for
motion are electrochemical, the quantity of energy to be accumulated in the secondary
accumulators of hybrid systems is usually low, and this may allow devices of other
types to be used. The drawbacks of electrochemical batteries become also less severe.
Elastic energy can be stored in a solid or in a gas. In the ﬁrst case, the energy

density e/m of the device is

where α1 and K are coefﬁcients linked to the ratio of the mass of the energy storage
elements and that of the whole device and to the shape of the storage element and its

battery electric vehicle, by installing two De Dion-Bouton ICE generators, to increase the available

stress distribution, with σ the maximum stress in the energy storing element and E
the Young’s modulus of the material.

Material with very high strength (spring steel) or low stiffness (elastomers) must
be used. The latter are particularly well suited, since some of them may be stretched
up to 500% with a good fatigue life and limited energy losses.

The use of a compressed gas, while considered for ﬁxed installations, has several
disadvantages for vehicular uses, due to its lower efﬁciency, the high mass of the
container of pressurized ﬂuid, and burst danger. Hydraulic accumulators, in which
the energy is stored in the walls of an elastomeric vessel full of ﬂuid, have been
suggested and tested in connection with hydraulic motors and pumps. The pressure
of the oil, however, is controlled by the characteristics of the elastomeric material
independent of driving or braking (in case of regenerative braking) torque. Reversible
variable displacement motors, which are quite complex and costly, are then required.
Energy can be stored in the form of kinetic energy in a ﬂywheel. The energy

density of a kinetic energy accumulator can be expressed as

(22.29)

where α1, α2 and K are coefﬁcients linked with the ratio of the mass of the ﬂywheel
and that of the whole system, to the depth of discharge actually performed and to

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

225

the shape and the stress distribution in the ﬂywheel. σ is the maximum stress in the
energy storing element and ρ is the density of the material.

Apart from some applications, like the city buses built by Oerlikon in the 1950s
and actually used in public service, ﬂywheels are now considered for use only in
hybrid systems. Their potentially high power density makes them very suitable for
supplying short bursts of power for acceleration or for storing braking energy.

A major problem is designing an adequate transmission: the velocity of the vehicle
must be variable at the will of the driver down to a full stop, while the angular velocity
of the ﬂywheel is proportional to the square root of the energy it contains. The
ﬂywheel reaches its maximum speed after recovering all the energy of the vehicle,
when the latter stops. This demands complex continuous transmissions that may
offset the advantages of this solution.

Some possible schemes for hybrid vehicles are the shown in Fig. 22.18:

(a) internal combustion engine—electric accumulator,
(b) internal combustion engine—elastic accumulator,
(c) internal combustion engine—ﬂywheel,
(d) electric accumulator—ﬂywheel,
(e) internal combustion engine—electric accumulator—ﬂywheel.

The ﬁrst three systems are similar, at least in principle. The thermal engine supplies
the average power, working in conditions that may be optimized in terms of efﬁciency
or pollution. A trade-off between these requirements can be made.

When the duty cycle includes frequent accelerations and braking, the advantages
of disconnecting the instantaneous power requirements from the working conditions
of the thermal engine, and of making regenerative braking possible, are large. The
possibility of using a far smaller engine allows one to keep mass and cost within the
limits of conventional systems or even to obtain mass and cost savings.

The solutions (a) in Fig. 22.18 are based on an internal combustion engine and
electric batteries. The Prius built by Toyota is an example of a hybrid vehicle of this
type (see below).

Remark 22.5 Hybrid vehicles with internal combustion engine and batteries appear
the worst alternative in theory, since electric accumulators work exactly in the way
which should be avoided, being called to supply high power for short periods; nev-
ertheless this is the only system used in practice today.

Solution (a1) is the most interesting, since the presence of an axle controlled by
a thermal engine and one controlled by electric motors allows side advantages, like
fully controlled 4WD and an active differential on the electric axle, as effective as a
VDC system, to be obtained.

Solution (b) may be used in hydrostatic transmissions; owing to the cost of the

latter, it is mainly considered for large city buses.

Solution (c) allows the use of a mechanical transmission, although the requirement
of an efﬁcient CVT with a wide range of transmission ratios is not easy to meet. The
very high efﬁciency and power density of ﬂywheels can be exploited.

Solution (d) is very interesting, since the ﬂywheel manages the power peaks
occurring during acceleration and regenerative braking, allowing the use of batteries
with low power density, thus increasing the efﬁciency, and hence the range, of the
vehicle, and the life cycle of the batteries.

Solution (e) combines the advantages of (a) and (d): The batteries work in optimal
conditions, and hence a smaller mass of batteries than in (a) is required. The presence
of the batteries allows a far larger engine-off range than in (c), to cope with conditions
in which the use of an internal combustion engine is not allowed (here it behaves like
a zero-emission vehicle), while the latter allows a practically unlimited range outside
these conditions.

In actual use, as already stated, the conﬁgurations considered for applications are
those based on an internal combustion engine plus electrical batteries only, labelled
as (a) in the ﬁgure.

The other solutions are more suitable for particular types of vehicles, like city

buses, heavy industrial vehicles, working machines and military vehicles.

The terms hybrid vehicle, or even hybrid electric vehicle, are just generic terms,
since the possible layouts for combining an internal combustion engine with one (or
more) electric motor are many, spanning from a conventional vehicle with a small
electric motor for restarting the engine and recovering some of the kinetic energy,
to a battery electric vehicle with an ICE to recharge the batteries (BEV with range
extender) or to a full hybrid vehicle in which most of the energy pass through the
electric branch.

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

227

If the distinctions are made following the extent of hybridization, the terms micro

hybrid, mild hybrid, full hybrid and plug-in hybrid are used.

If, on the contrary, the distinction is made following how the energy from the fuel
tank and that from the batteries interact, the terms parallel hybrid, through-the road
hybrid, series hybrid and split-ﬂow hybrid are used.

In the following the attention is concentrated on hybrid electric vehicles while,
owing to their limited use in the automotive ﬁeld, hydraulic and kinetic accumulators
are not dealt with at all.

It must be expressly stated that electric and hybrid electric vehicles are plagued
by a problem typical of electyrochemical batteries: the limited power they can accept
mostly during charging, but also during discharging. This limits the braking power—
but also the maximum acceleration—and to overcome these difﬁculties sometimes
hybrids using ﬂywheels to store kinetic energy instead of electrochemical batteries
have been suggested. The complexity and limited energy density of Flywheel Energy
Storage Systems (FESS) and the continuously improvements of the performance of
batteries prevented these solutions to enter the operational phase in recent times—
except for some Kinetic Energy Recovery Storage (KERS) systems used in Formula
1 racing.

Supercapacitors, on the contrary, can help a hybrid, or a purely electric, vehicle to
manage high powers during braking and acceleration so that hybrids with an ICE, a
battery and supercapacitors are sometimes considered, as well as BEVs with batteries
and supercapacitors. These devices were dealt with in the previous sections, together
with batteries.

22.11.2 Choice of the Voltage

Traditionally the electric systems installed on board road vehicles work at a voltage
of 12 V (cars) or 24 V (industrial vehicles). Most components which can be found
on the market for automotive use are thus tailored to work at 12 V, or at 24 V for the
industrial vehicles market. The point is that operating at such a low voltage leads to
use very high currents as soon as substantial powers are required: using high currents
means large cross sections of all conductors and thus leads to large costs and weights.
When powers in excess to a few kilowatts are required, there is a consistent advan-
tage in using higher voltages, but the development, manufacture, and maintenance of
high DC voltage devices in proximity of people is dangerous and so top priority must
be given to taking the required safety measures, as also prescribed by very detailed
standards. The potential risks are linked to:

• Electric energy,
• Accidental arcs,
• Electric current ﬂowing through the body (electric shock),
• Electromagnetic ﬁelds affecting biomedical devices, e.g. pacemakers,
• Interactions between electric energy and other media.

228

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Electric current can cause many reactions in the human body, the severity of which
depends on the amount of electrical current—and thus on the voltage—and the length
of time the current passes through the body. These effects may be subdivided as:

• Physiological Effect: The nervous system is affected, resulting in muscle spasms
that may prevent the victim from releasing the electriﬁed object, ventricular ﬁb-
rillation and cardiac arrest;

• Thermal effect: The current ﬂow causes burns on the entry and exit points and

coagulation of protein in the body;

• Chemical effect: The current can cause electrolytic degradation of cells or cellular

components which may lead to poisoning of the body.

The symptoms may only be recognizable after a certain time and a doctor should
be consulted even in the event of a minor accident with high voltage electric sources.
Since these effects are strictly linked with the voltage, and appear only when the
latter is higher than about 50–60 V, all applications involving the use of devices
operating below 60 V are considered as low voltage applications, while high voltage
applications are those where devices working at more than 60 V are used.

Mild hybrids often use 48 V motor/generators for energy recovery and for boost-
ing, when the power required for these functions are below 12 kW. This allows to
reduce the weight and the cost of the electric devices, without the need of complex
safety precautions.

Full hybrid vehicles and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) require higher powers,
which compels to enter the ﬁeld of high voltages, i.e. systems operating at more than
60 V.

In many cases, vehicles using high voltage systems have a double electric system:
all accessories which do not require to operate at high voltage, are connected to a low
voltage, usually 12 V, system, while the traction motors and the few other high power
devices operate at 300 or 400 V. The battery of the low voltage circuit is kept charged
from the high voltage circuit through a DC–DC converter. In this way the high voltage
components can be packaged in a protected zone, while the current distribution in the
various parts of the vehicle occurs at a safely low voltage. A secondary advantage is
the possibility of using the traditional, low cost, 12 V accessories used traditionally
in automotive applications.

22.11.3 Mild Hybrids

Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles (MHEV) are hybrid vehicles in which the power
managed by the electric drive is only a fraction of the total installed power. Moreover,
the general architecture is not much different from that of standard ICE vehicles, with
just an electric motor/generator added. The various architectures are differentiated
by the position in which the EM is located:

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

229

• P0: The electric machine is connected with the internal combustion engine through
a belt, on the front end accessory drive (The EM cannot be physically disconnected
from the ICE);

• P1: The electric machine is connected directly with the crankshaft of the internal
combustion engine—The EM cannot be physically disconnected from the ICE);
• P2: The electric machine is side-attached (through a belt) or integrated between the
internal combustion engine and the transmission; the electric machine is decoupled
from the ICE and it has the same speed of the ICE or is driven through a ﬁxed
transmission ratio;

• P3: The electric machine is connected through gear wheels to the transmission;
the electric machine is decoupled from the ICE and it’s speed is a multiple of the
wheel speed;

• P4: The electric machine is connected through gear wheels on the rear axle of the
vehicle—assuming that the ICE drives the front wheels—, is decoupled form the
ICE and may be located in the rear axle drive or in the wheel hubs.

All the schemes described in the present section (Fig. 22.19) can be deﬁned as
parallel hybrids from the viewpoint of how the energy from the fuel tank interacts
with that from the battery: the ‘P’ in the designation refers to this.

P0: Belt Starter Generator

The simplest solution, also known as belt integrated starter generator, is to install a
small electric motor in parallel with the internal combustion engine and to connect the
two using the belt (with a transmission ratio between 2 and 3) which in conventional
engines drives the alternator and other accessories like the compressor of the air
conditioner or the power steering (Fig. 22.19a).

The minimal solution is to use a 12 V motor with a peak power between 2 and
10 kW. With a 2 kW electric motor it is possible to perform a restart function—
retaining the conventional starter motor for cold starting—and recovering some
energy when the vehicle slows down to recharge the battery.

In this case, instead of mild hybrid, the term micro hybrid should be used. More-
over, micro hybrids are not actually hybrid vehicles, because the electric motor is
not powering the wheels, but just performing the start and stop task and sone battery
charging. Note that, owing to the frequent starts, the need for electric power on board
is increased, and using the kinetic energy of the vehicle to keep the battey charged
is an important issue.

If a larger motor generator, possibly a 12 or 14 kW motor operating at least at 48 V,
is used, it is possible to supply some extra power to the driveline during accelerations
so that the energy recovered during braking can be used not only for restarting the
engine, but also to improve acceleration performance, so that a true hybrid (although
mild hybrid) working is possible. Clearly the size of the battery must be accordingly
increased.

The increase of the power to be managed by the belt implies the need to increase
the belt tensioning, which in turn increases the load on the bearings of the crankshaft

230

combustion engine; M/G: motor/generator; SM: starter motor; T: transmission

but also of all other devices which are moved by the belt, so that the bearing drag
and wear increase too. A controllable tensioner which releases the belt tensioning
when the electric motor torque is low, can thus strongly decrease the bearing drag
and wear and has also the advantage of signiﬁcantly decreasing Noise, Vibrations
and Harshness (NVH) of the engine.

The P0 architecture, even when using a 48 V or an high voltage electric machine,
has the advantage of retaining the usual architecture of the vehicle for the whole drive-
line, with the only difference of adding the motor/generator (which in many cases may
even be air cooled) and its belt drive (with the added complication of the adjustable
tensioner), a larger battery and some control electronics. If the motor/generator is
large enough to perform cold starting, it is possible to dispense of the usual electric
starter motor. It is thus a simple and low cost solution which can be implemented on
existing platforms. It may improve the fuel efﬁciency on NEDC by 10–12% and on
WLTP by 7–9 %.

Clearly the improvements in performance are limited owing to the limited torque
which may be transmitted by the belt drive and the braking energy recuperation is
limited owing to the impossibility of disconnecting the engine from the transmission

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

231

during braking. A peculiar problem related with the braking energy recovery with
this (and P1) conﬁgurations is the tendency of the driver to press the clutch pedal
too early when braking: the electric motor is thus cut off from the power ﬂow during
a substantial part of braking. An automatic clutch can thus be inserted so that the
controller provides to keep the clutch engaged for a longer time, allowing to recover
more energy.

The clutch today is often a double clutch and, in mild hybrids, a third, automatic
clutch can be added to these two clutches. A triple clutch thus allows a better man-
agement of the power ﬂow.

P1: Crankshaft Mounted Electric Machine

The P1 architecture is similar to P0, but now the EM is directly located on the
crankshaft (Fig. 22.19b). The torque the motor/generator can supply is larger, since
is not limited by the belt drive and there is no problem linked with the bearing drag
and wear due to the pull of the belt—or the need to introduce a complex controllable
tensioner. The conventional starter motor can be removed. However, the electric
machine has the same speed of the crankshaft, so a torque motor supplying large
torques at relatively low speed is needed. The design changes from the conventional
arrangement are larger than in the case of P0 hybrids, and likely air cooled electrical
machines cannot be used.

Like in the P0 conﬁguration, owing to the impossibility of mechanically discon-
necting the electric motor from the ICE, it is not possible to recuperate energy with
the engine disengaged, during coasting.

P2 Transmission Mounted Electric Motor

The electric motor is mounted at the transmission side of the clutch, either directly or
through gear wheels (or even a belt) (Fig. 22.19c). The advantage with respect to P1
is the possibility of disconnecting the ICE during energy recuperation (recuperation
during coasting), doing it more efﬁciently or to move the vehicle at low speed (electric
creep) in a purely electrical way. If the EM is powerful enough and the battery allows
it, it may even be possible to have a short range in electric-only mode. If the EM is
mounted directly, the same disadvantage as in the P1 case are present.

A separate starter motor must be supplied to perform the start and stop function.

The same holds also for the following architectures.

P3 Final Drive Mounted Electric Motor

The electric machine is connected to the output shaft of the transmission, so that
its speed is proportional to the speed of the wheels, i.e. it is not affected by the
chosen gear ratio (Fig. 22.19d). The ﬁxed transmission ratio between the EM and
the wheels is chosen so that the motor spins at the most suitable speed to exert a
high enough torque on the wheels. The advantage are providing the highest energy
recovery, allowing recuperation during coasting and performing electric creep.

232

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

P4 Rear Axle Mounted Electric Motor

It is like the P3 architecture, but the electric machine is mounted on the other axle
with respect to the ICE (on the rear axle, if the latter is mounted on the front axle)
(Fig. 22.19e). An additional differential is required, or two electric motors may be
connected (directly or through a reduction gear) on the wheels, in which case the
functions of the differential are performed by the control electronics (electronic
differential or torque vectoring). The advantages are the same as those of the P3
architecture, with the added advantage of allowing 4WD operation, even if with
limited torque on the rear axle. An advantage is that the rear powered axle can be
substituted for the conventional non-powered axle, transforming a traditional car into
a mild hybrid one with limited speciﬁc investments.

Solutions P3 and P4 may improve the fuel efﬁciency on NEDC by 19–22% and

on WLTP by 14–16%.

22.11.4 Parallel Full Hybrids

In parallel hybrid systems the ICE and the EM are connected together and add their
driving actions to power the vehicle. Each of them can also drive the vehicle by itself
individually. A general scheme is shown in Fig. 22.20, but many detailed schemes
can be devised, depending on how the actual system is designed. All schemes of
Fig. 22.19 can be deﬁned as parallel hybrids, even if that of Fig. 22.19d is more a
through-the-road hybrid. The differences between the systems described in the pre-
vious section and in the present one is mostly in the word ‘mild’, i.e. in the amount of
hybridization. In practice there is a much larger difference, because most components
of mild hybrids are similar (if not identical) to those of conventional vehicles, while
those of full hybrids must be designed ad hoc. Another difference is the size of the
batteries, which in full hybrids are larger than in mild ones. This allows to increase
the energy recovery during braking, which is anyway limited by the efﬁciency of the
electrical machine working in generator mode and the charge/discharge efﬁciency
of the batteries, particularly when recharged with high currents, as it occurs during
electric braking.

When the wheels require less power than what the ICE can supply, the latter can

recharge the batteries.

As already stated, through the road hybrids are parallel hybrids, and in this case
the battery can be charged by the ICE only with the vehicle in motion, with the losses
at the road-wheel contact playing a greater role.

Remark 22.6 The difference between the two types of hybrids does not depend so
much on the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 22.20, but mostly on the strategy of the
controller.

22.11.5 Series Hybrids

In series hybrids (Fig. 22.21) the ICE is coupled with an electric generator, which
produces electric power to both charge the battery and to power the electric traction
motor. The latter can draw the current it needs from both the generator and the
batteries. The driving axle (or axles) may have a single motor, with a mechanical
differential, or a motor on each wheel with an electronic differential.

When the capacity of the batteries is large, the vehicle may work also as a Battery
Electric Vehicle (BEV) for some time. It is possible to design the system so that
the battery-only range, in which the vehicle is a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV), is
substantial. In this case the vehicle is often deﬁned as a an Extended-Range Electric
Vehicle (EREV) or Range-Extended Electric Vehicle (REEV).

The idea of substituting an electrical transmission for the mechanical one is very
old, dating back to the beginning of the twentieth century, and is common in diesel-
electric locomotives and ships. Actually, a series hybrid is just a vehicle with electric
transmission plus a battery. This was also the scheme used by Ferdinand Porsche in
his early hybrid cars, shown in Fig. 22.17.

22.11.6 Power-Split and Series-Parallel Hybrids

Power-split hybrids, or series-parallel hybrids, are series hybrids in which a mechan-
ical transmission links the two power sources, so that the power can ﬂow through
both the mechanical or the electric transmission (Fig. 22.22).

The sketch of Fig. 22.22 is just a general indication: the actual detailed conﬁgu-

ration of each application may differ in many details.

An example of power split hybrid is the Toyota Prius, the ﬁrst hybrid car in the
world to be mass-produced. It is a power split hybrid because the internal combus-
tion engine, the electric motor and the generator, arranged co-axially, as shown in the
sketch of Fig. 22.23, are connected through a planetary gear: the generator is con-
nected to the sun gear, the ICE to the carrier and the electric motor to the crown gear.
The electric motor drives directly the differential through a chain drive. No gearbox

etary gear, Ch: drive to the ﬁnal gear at the differential D

is thus needed, because the speed of the crown gear—and thus of the wheels—is
directly adjusted by controlling the electric motor. The generator may either charge
the battery or directly power the electric traction motor through the inverter. At start-
up and at very slow speed, the electric motor works alone. The thermal engine cuts
in automatically at medium speed.10

The angular velocity of the thermal engine adapts to that of the vehicle by changing
the speed of the generator, something that can occur only by subtracting a torque,
through the generator. By doing this, some power from the thermal engine charges
the battery, as in the series layout. At low speed, a part of the power needed for motion
is supplied by the electric motor, which takes it from the battery. Finally, at a very
low speed only the electric motor operates, as in parallel layouts. This also occurs
when the speed of the thermal engine can adapt itself to that of the vehicle, without
the generator subtracting any power. When the vehicle slows down, the available
kinetic energy is recovered.

This method allows the working range of the thermal engine to be restricted to
that where minimum fuel consumption is obtained, for a given power requirement.
It is also possible to stop the engine when the vehicle stops and to restart it easily at
a speed greater than that at which conventional starter motors operate, owing to the

generator that is now used as a motor. The batteries are never recharged from outside
the vehicle.

The internal combustion engine operates with gasoline, according to an Atkinson
cycle, to reduce pumping losses at partial load, by reducing air intake by a later
closing of the intake valve instead of using a throttle valve.

In the Fig. 22.23, ICE is the thermal engine, G a generator, EM a traction electric
motor, PG a planetary gear, Ch a chain controlling the gear ratio of the ﬁnal drive
of the differential D, in some cases simply made with a gear. Note that there is no
gearbox between the thermal engine and the transmission to the wheels.11

If τo is the gear ratio on the planetary gear when the carrier is ﬁxed (here the

carrier is connected to the thermal engine), it follows that

τo = − na
ns

,

(22.30)

where na and ns are the number of teeth of the crown and the sun; the sign is minus
since, when the carrier is ﬁxed, the crown and the sun rotate in opposite directions.

The simple equation

(cid:2)G + (cid:2)E M = (1 − 1
τo

)(cid:2)I C E ,

(22.31)

where the angular velocities of the various elements are (cid:2)G, (cid:2)E M and (cid:2)I C E , can be
written.

In the same way, by indicating with MG, ME M and MI C E the torques acting on

the same elements, it is possible to write

MT − ME M = MI C E − MG,
(MT − ME M )(cid:2)E M = MI C E (cid:2)I C E − MG(cid:2)G.

(22.32)

These equations have been obtained by stating the equilibrium for rotation of the
gears and the conservation of the power that goes through it. MT is the available
torque on the gear wheel driving the chain Ch. By eliminating one of the three
equations, it follows that

MG = MI C E

This system works both as a parallel and a series hybrid.
The angular velocity of the thermal engine adapts to that of the vehicle by changing
the speed of the generator, following Eq. (22.31), something that can occur only by

subtracting a torque, through the generator, following Eq. (22.33). By doing this,
some power from the thermal engine charges the battery, as in the series layout.

At low speed, a part of the power needed for motion is supplied by the electric
motor, which takes it from the battery. Finally, at a very low speed only the electric
motor operates, as in parallel layouts. This also occurs when the speed of the thermal
engine can adapt itself to that of the vehicle, without the generator subtracting any
power.

When the vehicle slows down, the available kinetic energy is recovered.
This method allows the working range of the thermal engine to be restricted to
that where minimum fuel consumption is obtained, for a given power requirement.
It is also possible to stop the engine when the vehicle stops and to restart it easily
at a speed greater than those at which conventional starter motors operate, owing to
the generator that is now used as a motor.

The batteries are never recharged from outside the vehicle.
The fuel consumption, obtained using a gasoline engine (Atkinson cycle), is sim-
ilar to that of a diesel vehicle with similar performance; CO2 emissions are lower,
due to the lower quantity of carbon contained in the same volume of gasoline; other
emissions are much lower, due to the reduced working of the engine in variable con-
ditions owing to the more constant use of the thermal engine made possible by the
hybrid layout.

Another simple example of series-parallel hybrid system is reported in Fig. 22.24
and adopted with some slight modiﬁcation by a recent Honda application. In this
case, if the clutch is disengaged the system is working as a series hybrid powertrain,
if the clutch is engaged the system is working as a parallel hybrid powertrain. Note
that engaging the clutch is possible only at a vehicle speed compatible with the
minimum engine rotation speed acceptable for high torque operation, i.e. on open
roads or motorways.

22.11.7 Plug-in Hybrids

Plug-in hybrids are full hybrids with increased battery capacity, so that they have
a greater range as pure electric vehicles (BEV) and whose battery can be charged
from an external power supply, like in BEVs. They can be seen as hybrid vehicles
which can be recharged from an external source, or as battery electric vehicles which
carry on board the means for recharging the battery using an ICE connected with
a generator, i.e. as Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) or Range-Extended
Electric Vehicles (REEVs). They are also called gas-optional, or griddable, hybrids.
The idea behind plug-in hybrids is to enjoy the advantages of a BEV in most of the
daily commuting trips (about 50 km/day), usually performed in urban trafﬁc, while
maintaining the long range and the refueling ease for the occasionally longer trips
during week-ends and vacations. In fact a 50 km range is compatible with recharging
at home during night time.

22.11.8 Conclusions

Hybrid vehicles provided with an internal combustion engine, one or more electric
motors and an electrochemical battery are on the market since about two decades,
even if at present they represent a small, but deﬁnitely growing, share of the total
automotive market.

22.11 Partial Electriﬁcation: Hybrid Vehicles

239

The question whether they represent the future of automotive vehicles is often

asked. Their advantages are:

• They require smaller batteries and (in some conﬁgurations) smaller electric motors

than battery electric vehicles;

• They are more energy efﬁcient than conventional internal combustion engine vehi-

cles;

• They can pollute less then a conventional combustion engine vehicle and in case
of plug-in conﬁguration as much as an electric vehicle for most of the time the
vehicle is driven in urban trafﬁc;

• Even in case of the plug-in conﬁguration they are free of some of the typical
drawbacks of battery electric vehicles, like limited range, excessive recharge time,
increase of electric energy consumption.

On the other side, they are surely more complex than both conventional and battery
electric vehicles and the energy required for their construction is likely to be larger
than that required by at least conventional vehicles.

An assessment on this issue is made more difﬁcult by the wide variety of hybrid
vehicles that are presently built and are proposed for the future: as already stated,
they go from what are practically battery electric vehicles with a small on board
charging facility, to almost conventional vehicles with a device to recover some
braking energy and to improve acceleration. In this sense, racing cars with a Kinetic
Energy Recovery Storage (KERS) could qualify as hybrid vehicles, even if usually
this term is restricted to vehicles in which the amount of energy stored is larger.

The present and, even more, the future improvements in the battery ﬁeld answered
to the objection that batteries do not have the power density for applications of this
kind, or at least that they work in inadequate condition on hybrid vehicles, causing
a short life. To avoid this problem, mostly related to lead acid batteries, hybrid
vehicles can be provided with supercapacitors, obviously at the cost of a further
added complexity. Most of these problems were solved with advanced batteries, and
lithium batteries lend themselves optimally to the use on hybrid vehicles, although
with some safety problems.

The efﬁciency of the internal combustion engine is important, and thus a deﬁ-
nite improvement is obtained by using an Atkinson cycle instead of an Otto cycle.
Attempts to use small gas turbines, on the basis of their higher efﬁciency, have been
done. Speciﬁcally designed engine-generator units are under study for series hybrid,
in which the unit has no mechanical energy output. Conﬁgurations can be used in
which the pistons operate linear generators directly, without needing to transform
reciprocating into rotational motion.

Hybrid vehicles have some peculiar safety problems: ﬁrst due to the management
of advanced batteries, but they are less severe than the problems linked with BEVs,
owing to the smaller size of the battery pack. Another problem is related to the use of
high voltages, as already seen in the section dealing with the choice of the voltage.
A peculiar aspect was highlighted in a 2009 National Highway Trafﬁc Safety
Administration report which examined hybrid electric vehicle accidents involving

240

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving conventional
vehicles. The ﬁndings showed that, in certain road situations, HEVs are more dan-
gerous for cyclists and pedestrians because, when slowing down or stopping, backing
up, entering or leaving a parking space, etc., owing to the much lower noise level.
For crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians, there was a higher incident rate for
HEVs when a vehicle was turning a corner, but there was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight. Several
automakers developed electric vehicle warning sounds designed to alert pedestrians
of the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicle, plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles travelling at low speeds. Their pur-
pose is to make pedestrians, cyclists, the blind, and others aware of the vehicle’s
presence while operating in all-electric mode.

It has been stated that hybrid vehicles are less polluting and more fuel efﬁcient
(and thus they produce less greenhouse gasses) than conventional vehicles when they
run. However, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid
car batteries. Today they are mostly of two types: nickel metal hydride, or lithium
ion; both are regarded as more environmentally friendly than lead-based batteries
which constitute the bulk of conventional car starter batteries today and lithium ion
is the least toxic.

The toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteries
compared with lead acid batteries are still controversial and depend mostly on the
extent the latter are recycled. Lithium-ion batteries are appealing because they have
the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage
more than three times that of nickel–metal hydride battery cells while simultaneously
storing large quantities of electricity as well. Lithium batteries also produce higher
output (boosting vehicle power), higher efﬁciency and provide excellent durability,
with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle. Addi-
tionally, use of lithium-ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and
also achieves improved fuel economy of 30% better than petrol-powered vehicles
with a consequent reduction in CO2 emissions.

As a consequence, hybrid vehicles are convenient from both the economical and
environmental viewpoint only above a certain distance travelled by a vehicle during
its entire working life.

In conclusion, while it is certain that hybrid vehicles are the best solution for
many applications, such as vehicles used mostly in an urban environment and vehi-
cles travelling a long distance during their life (taxis being a typical example), it is
questionable whether vehicles which are used less, or operate mostly outside cities,
could really beneﬁt from hybrid technology. It is possible to predict that the improve-
ments in battery, motor and power converter technologies will cause the number of
hybrid vehicles to increase in the future but a complete substitution of conventional
vehicles can be considered as unlikely.

22.12 E-Mobility

22.12.1 General Considerations

241

Electric vehicles are once again arousing the interest of car manufacturers worldwide
for the role they may have in satisfying the demand for mobility and the need for
virtually zero impact on air quality in urban areas. The advantages of electric vehicles
are linked primarily to the possibility of moving the pollution from where the vehicle
is used to where the power is generated, taking advantage of the better pollution
control of power stations versus small engines. Another advantage is the possibility
of regenerative braking.

Starting from the 1970s, many governmental or local administrations passed acts
which tend to limit the access to city centres of vehicles with internal combustion
engine and this trend is going to develop in the future. The ﬁrst state to strongly
act to reduce pollution caused by vehicular trafﬁc was California, and, in the 1990s
the California Air Resources Board stated, for example, that the percentage of zero
emission vehicles (ZEVs) had to pass from 2% of the total of vehicles sold in the
state in 1998 to 10% in 2003. These ZEV Regulations require large and intermediate
volume vehicle manufacturers to bring to and operate in California a certain percent of
ZEVs, clean plug-in hybrids, clean hybrids and clean gasoline vehicles with near-zero
tail pipe emissions. In 2014 an initiative to put 3.3 million Zero-Emission Vehicles
on the Road by 2025 was announced.

The disadvantages are also well known: The performance of electric drives is
affected by losses in both the engine and the batteries, and above all by the difﬁculties
batteries have in delivering high power and, even more, accepting the power bursts
that occur in braking. The quantity of energy that can be actually recovered by
regenerative braking is thus only a fraction of that theoretically available. The main
limitations of electric vehicles are still the same that caused their use to be practically
discontinued at the beginning of the twentieth century; their reduced range, the
limited duration and high cost of the batteries and their high mass. However the
performance of electric vehicles is sufﬁcient for urban use.

From the energy point of view, the advantages of battery powered electric vehicles
are still in doubt: When the primary source is a fossil fuel, in spite of the greater
efﬁciency of the primary conversion and regenerative braking, the overall consump-
tion is comparable to, and usually higher than, that of internal combustion engines.
Following this line, also greenhouse gas emissions are worse in the case of BEVs
than in conventional vehicles, if the primary source of energy to produce electricity
is anyway fossil fuels.

The energy consumption of a battery electric vehicle is not better than that of a
conventional vehicle, but it is likely worse. Electric energy has to be produced in
power stations from the primary source, then transported along the electric lines,
used to charge the vehicle battery and then transformed into mechanical energy in
the electric motor. Each step has its own efﬁciency, in particular the charging and
discharging of the battery has an efﬁciency that depends on many factors, but cannot

242

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

be very high. The average efﬁciency with which electric energy is produced at the
power station is much higher than the efﬁciency of the internal combustion engines
of cars (typically 39% against and average of 20–25%) but this is usually not enough
to compensate for the larger number of energy transformations from the primary
source to the wheels.

The well-to-wheel energy consumption is bound to increase with a large use
of electric vehicles. If large use is made of coal, the greenhouse gas production is
worsened. Only if the energy is produced by nuclear or renewable sources, there is
an advantage in a large use of electric vehicles, that are a solution suited only to an
energy-rich society, possibly based on nuclear power.

Battery electric vehicles have a true advantage only if the global energy system of
a country is based on energy sources different from oil (and also natural gas) and in
particular if the power stations operate on a mix of nuclear and renewable energies.
The emissions of CO2 by BEVs in different countries are reported in Fig. 22.25: the
computations were performed for Nissan Leaf in the EUDC cycle. On the same ﬁgure
also the emission of a conventional and a hybrid vehicle of similar size, evaluated
at 230 g/km and 170 g/km respectively, are reported. The BEV is at advantage
with respect to the hybrid vehicle only in countries with an energy system with low
carbon emissions, while if the country depends heavily on coal it is even worse than
conventional vehicles.

Moreover, a drawback of electric vehicles is the impossibility of using waste heat
for heating: the alternatives of using a burner fueled by gasoline, electric energy from
the battery or a separate thermal energy storage are either unpractical or quite energy
intensive.

Note that all the above considerations are in a way incorrect, because they do
not take into account the whole life-cycle balance, and speciﬁcally do not take into
account the energy required to build the batteries (that have a limited life), and the
energy and costs related with the required increase of generation capacity and with the
increase of the capacity of electric power lines, even if the last two can be mitigated
by charging the batteries in off-peak hours.

The biggest problem electric vehicles always had to face is the low performance
of lead-acid electric batteries, the only rechargeable batteries that, until not many
years ago, could be realistically used in the automotive ﬁeld. This situation has
changed in the last 15 years and hopefully will further change in the future, owing to
new battery types that are now available (see Sect. 22.8). Also the problems linked
with the limited power density are now less severe, owing to the possibility of using
supercapacitors as an intermediate energy storage able to supply and absorb the peak
currents the motor/generators are absorbing or producing.

The available space for improvement can be estimated from Table 22.5, in which
the maximum theoretical energy density of some battery systems is compared with
the energy density actually achieved at a cell and a battery level: It is clear that
the theoretical energy density, that takes into account only the mass of the electro-
chemical reactants, is a maximum that cannot be closely approached. Some space
for improvement is shown also by the comparison of the cell energy density with
the actual battery energy density; some savings in the mass of the battery structure

a Nissan Leaf on the EUDC cycle. Also the emission of a conventional and a hybrid vehicle of

integrating cells, installation interfaces and cooling system that are usually needed
can improve the energy density of all battery types.

However, the problems related with battery electric vehicles are more linked with
their mass production in large quantities than with designing and building vehicles of
this type that can satisfy the customers’ needs. The ﬁrst point, as already discussed, is
the large scale availability of the materials needed to build the batteries, like lithium.

engine (gasoline and diesel), hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric powertrain is shown

in Table 22.6. All data have been normalized with those on the plug-in hybrid vehi-
cle. The cost were computed assuming a cost of gasoline of 1.5–1.6 e/l and a cost
of electricity of 0.25 e/kWh. From the table it is clear that the gasoline powered
conventional car is lighter and has a lower cost, both to buy and to maintain the
vehicle.

The true advantages of hybrid and electric vehicles, their reduced pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions, are not shown in this table, and the latter are much variable
from country to country, ranging from much worse to much better than conventional
vehicles (see Fig. 22.25).

Other improvements, that in the last years made the construction of effective
electric cars possible, are linked with advancements in electric motors and power
electronics technology. Brushless, rare earths, permanent magnet motors, can reduce
the bulk and weight of the powerplant as well as increasing their efﬁciency, which
for DC brushless motors now exceed 90% in many working conditions.

Here another limitation can be predicted: the availability of neodymium, essential
in the production of powerful neodymium-iron-boron magnets for electric motors
and generators, is limited and its production is at present less than 20,000 t per year.
A severe shortage of neodymium, whose production is concentrated (about 97%) in

22.12 E-Mobility

245

a single country (China) and the subsequent sharp price increase, is predicted for
the foreseeable future. For sure, the neodymium reserves are insufﬁcient to build
a number of electric motors corresponding to the conversion of a large portion of
vehicles to electric power.

As a conclusion, battery electric vehicles are improving their performance, and
there is no doubt that prototypes with performance similar to those of conventional
vehicles can be built already at present and, even more, in the near future. To build
a good number of such vehicles at a cost and with an ease of use matching what
the customers at present expect from a car is a more difﬁcult task, although a task
manageable in the future. What at present seems to be unfeasible, and even inadvis-
able, is an attempt to substitute altogether present internal combustion vehicles with
electric vehicles.

Even worse are the perspectives for electric vehicles powered through fuel cells;
some experts believe that fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive
with other technologies or that it will take decades for them to become proﬁtable. In
July 2011, the Chairman and CEO of General Motors, Daniel Akerson, stated that
while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing, “The car is still too expensive
and probably won’t be practical until the 2020-plus period, I don’t know.”12 Similarly,
Steven Chu, the US Secretary of Energy of the Obama administration, stated that
hydrogen vehicles “will not be practical over the next 10–20 years”.13 Furthermore,
he stated that since hydrogen is primarily obtained by reforming natural gas, some
of the energy content of natural gas is lost and there does not yet exist a good storage
mechanism for transportation.

Fuel cell technology thus seems to be an hypothetical alternative for the far future,
in a scenario of abundant energy produced by a primary source different from fossil
fuels and after the problems related with production, storage and distribution of
hydrogen have been solved.

22.12.2 Vehicle Architecture

The most important problem to be solved in designing the layout of Battery Electric
Vehicles (BEV) is battery installation, because of its signiﬁcant volume and weight.
The best results can be obtained only if the vehicle is speciﬁcally designed as a BEV
from the beginning or, at least, if in the design of the electric versions of a conventional
car, provisions are taken to ﬁnd space for the batteries at the very beginning of the
development process.

The scheme of a very simple electric drive system is shown in Fig. 22.26; it
essentially consists of a number of traction batteries, an inverter, a three-phase

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Fig. 22.26 Scheme of a simple electric vehicle

asynchronous or a DC brushless electric motor and a DC/DC electric converter,
which converts traction battery voltage into a lower voltage (12 V) for recharging
the service battery.

As already stated in the section devoted to electric motors, three-phase asyn-
chronous or brushless DC motors are preferred to the brushed direct current motors
used in vehicular applications in the past because they:

• are more compact, lightweight and have a high speciﬁc power;
• have a wide operating range at constant power;
• have a better energy efﬁciency; and
• are highly reliable and, due to the absence of brushes, are virtually maintenance-

free.

These advantages are even more marked if a brushless DC motor is used, like in

the more advanced applications.

Since the electric motor can start under a load, there is no need for a clutch and
in some cases there is also no need for a gearbox with more than one transmission
ratio. However, if we recall the efﬁciency map reported in Fig. 22.13 we notice also in
electric motors some sensitivity to rotational speed variation; therefore also electric
motors could beneﬁt from a gearbox, probably limited to two or three transmission
ratios.

The asynchronous or DC brushless motor can thus be conveniently arranged on
the rear end of the vehicle, if the rear wheels are the driving ones. It drives the rear
wheels via a mechanical one or two-speeds gearbox and a differential unit.

As an alternative to this traditional architecture, with the motor operating the
wheels through a mechanical transmission, it is possible to put two or more motors
directly in the wheels. Since this layout causes a substantial increase of the unsprung
masses, there can be one electric motor per wheel, located on the sprung mass of
the vehicle, driving the relevant wheel through a half-shaft. However, recent studies
showed that the increase of the unsprung mass due to locating the motors in the
wheels doesn’t have severe drawbacks.

22.12 E-Mobility

247

Traditional or brushless DC or AC motors require a mechanical transmission (at
least with a ﬁxed ratio), since they supply an insufﬁcient torque and operate at a speed
that is higher than that of the wheels, while high torque motors (torque motors, both
with internal or external rotor) can be connected directly to the wheels without an
interposed reduction gear, but are generally heavier than high speed motors plus the
required reduction gear. Putting the motor in the wheels without using a reduction
gear leads to high efﬁciency, low noise and a large degree of freedom in placing
the various subsystems on the vehicle, but direct drive, torque motors seem to be
more a perspective for a future, nobody knows how far, than a possibility for today.
When two electric motors operate the two wheels of the same axle, either located in
the wheels or attached to the body and operating the wheels through semi-axles, the
motor control system can perform the electronic differential function, distributing
the torque to the wheels of the axle, possibly simulating all the functions of a limited
slip (controlled) differential.

This solution has however two other disadvantages, apart from the increase of the

insprung masses:

• Using a ﬁxed ratio transmission either the starting torque or the maximum speed is
too low. To circumvent these disadvantages, a larger and heavier motor is required.
• The electronic differential, i.e. a controller which is able to distribute the driving
torque to the two wheels of the axle, is not yet a mature technology, and has caused
some accidents in some attempts of application.

As already stated, apart from the traction batteries, that supply a voltage in the
range 96–300 V, on board electric vehicles there is usually a 12 V battery powering
all services. A DC–DC converter transforms high voltage direct current into 12 V
direct current, for keeping the low-voltage battery charged. This redundancy is due
to the need to ensuring emergency operation with ﬂat traction batteries and also for
the already stated safety reasons: high voltage must be conﬁned to the few points
where it is absolutely needed, and even so the dangers of high DC voltage in electric
cars must not be understated. The choice of 12 V for low voltage accessories is
also motivated by the economic advantage of using components that are standard in
existing vehicles.

Traction batteries may be recharged either by the on-board battery charger, from
the AC mains, or by a dedicated ﬁxed system which powers the DC batteries directly.
80% of the maximum battery charge is reached in approximately 4 h while the time
needed for a complete recharge cycle is about 8 h if the battery capacity is below
10 kWh; larger batteries require a speciﬁc connection to the AC mains to be charged
in a reasonable time. It must be remembered that fast charging requires high charging
currents, which are unavailable from domestic sockets: even if all the current from a
3 kW domestic plant is used to charge a 30 kWh battery, the charge lasts 10 h, or more
if the efﬁciency of the charger and of the battery is considered. A public recharging
system used for recharging quickly a number of batteries used in BEVs, must be
fed by a transmission line rated several MW—to charge in 1 h 100 batteries rated
30 kWh, taking into account the efﬁciencies, a 4 MW line is needed.

248

22 Prime Movers for Motor Vehicles

Batteries must be fully recharged frequently during normal vehicle use to ensure
good battery performance; the batteries may be conveniently recharged at night.
Modern (non lead-acid) batteries require careful charging and sophisticated chargers
are used both for improving the whole charge-discharge process and for safety.

As already described, a very interesting solution which in the future can material-
ize, is the charging of the batteries during motion through an inductive system with
the primary coils located under the road surface and the secondary coil on the ﬂoor
of the BEV. This could reduce the required battery capacity, leading to lighter and
cheaper vehicles at a price of a much expensive road infrastructure.

All major car manufacturers have electric cars on the market or, at least, under
development: Renault, taken as an example, presents a very complete range, now
on sale on selected European markets. The models of this range, whose pictures are
shown in Fig. 22.27, are many and feature technical speciﬁcations not so different
from their internal combustion engine counterparts, as shown in Table 22.7.

When electric vehicles are compared with conventional vehicles on the grounds of
performance, ﬂexibility, comfort and safety levels their traditional shortcomings—
namely heavy weight, low range, long battery recharging time and high costs—are
still there and it is predictable that this situation will improve slowly, but consistently.

When computing the performance of a vehicle in longitudinal motion (maximum
speed, gradeability, fuel consumption, braking, etc.), the vehicle is modelled as a
rigid body, or in an even simpler way, as a point mass.

The presence of suspensions and the compliance of tires are then neglected and
motion is described by a single equation, the equilibrium equation in the longitudinal
direction. If the x-axis is assumed to be parallel to the ground, the longitudinal
equilibrium equation reduces to

m ¨x =

Fxi ,

(cid:2)

∀i

(23.1)

where Fxi are the various forces acting on the vehicle in the longitudinal direction
(aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, traction, braking forces, etc.).

As will be seen later, Eq. (23.1) is quite a rough model for various reasons.
For one thing, when the vehicle is accelerated, a number of rotating masses must be
accelerated as well; this, however, can be accounted for easily. Other approximations
come from the fact that the vehicle does not travel under symmetrical conditions,
particularly when the trajectory is not straight and the direction of the x-axis does
not coincide with the direction of the velocity or, in other words, the sideslip angle
β is in general different from zero.

23.1 Load Distribution on the Ground

Longitudinal dynamics is inﬂuenced by the distribution of normal forces at the
wheels-ground contact. A vehicle with more than three wheels is statically indeter-
minate, and the load distribution is determined by characteristics of the suspensions
which, as seen in Part I, also have the task of distributing the load on the ground in
proper way. However, if the system is symmetrical with respect to the x z plane, all
Driving Dynamic Performance

loads are equally symmetrical, and the velocity is contained in the symmetry plane,
then the two wheels of any axle are equally loaded. In this case, it is possible to think
in terms of axles rather than wheels, and a two-axle vehicle may be considered as
a beam on two supports which is, then, a statically determined system. In this case,
the forces on the ground do not depend on the characteristics of the suspensions and
the vehicle can be modelled as a rigid body.

23.1.1 Vehicles with Two Axles

Consider the vehicle as a rigid body and neglect the compliance of the suspensions
and of the body. As previously stated, if the vehicle is symmetrical with respect to
the x y-plane,1 it can be modelled as a beam on two supports, and normal forces Fz1
and Fz2 acting on the axles can be computed easily.

With the vehicle at a standstill on level road the normal forces are

(23.2)

The forces acting on a two-axle vehicle moving on straight road with longitudinal
grade angle α (positive when moving uphill) are sketched in Fig. 23.1. Note that the
x-axis is assumed to be parallel to the road surface.

Taking into account the inertia force −m ˙V acting in x direction on the centre of
mass, the dynamic equilibrium equations for translations in the x and z direction and
rotations about point O are

If the rolling resistance is ascribed completely to the forward displacement of the

resultant Fzi of contact pressures σz, distances (cid:2)xi can be easily computed as

(cid:2)xi = Rli f = Rli

( f0 + K V 2).

(23.4)

Except in the case of vehicles with different wheels on the various axles, such as

F-1 racers, the values of (cid:2)xi are all equal.

The second and third equation (23.3) can be solved in the normal forces acting

on the axles, yielding

The values of (cid:2)xi are usually quite small (in particular, their difference is usually
equal to zero) and can be neglected. If considered, they introduce a further weak
dependence of the vertical loads on the square of the speed, owing to the term K V 2
in the rolling resistance.

Example 23.1 Compute the force distribution on the ground of the small car of
Appendix E.1 at sea level, with standard pressure and temperature, in the following
conditions:

(a) at standstill on level road;
(b) driving at 100 km/h on level road;
(c) driving at 70 km/h on a 10% grade;

254

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

(d) braking with a deceleration of 0.4 g on level road at a speed of 100 km/h.

The air density in the mentioned conditions is 1.2258 kg/m3.

(a) Using Eq. (23.2), the static load distribution between the axles is

(cid:3)01

= 0.597,

(cid:3)02

= 0.403.

The forces acting on the axles are then

Fz1

= 4863 N ,

Fz2

= 3280 N .

(b) From Eq. (23.4), at 100 km/h = 27.78 m/s the value of (cid:2)x is 4.6 mm for all tires.
This value is so small that it could be neglected; it will, however, be considered
in the following computations.
Constants K1 and K2 are easily computed

K1 = 8.505 × 10−6 s2/m,

K2 = −5.869 × 10−5 s2/m.

The forces acting on the axles are then

Fz1

= 4820 N ,

Fz2

= 3491 N .

(c) A 10% grade corresponds to a grade angle α = 5.7◦. Operating in the same way,
at 70 km/h = 19.44 m/s the value of (cid:2)x is 4.0 mm for all tires. The other results
are

K1 = 8.490 × 10−6 s2/m,

K2 = −5.867 × 10−5 s2/m,

Fz1

= 4643 N ,

Fz2

= 3542 N .

(d) The acceleration is ˙V = −3.924 m/s2. As the speed is the same as in case (b),

the same values for (cid:2)x, K1 and K2 hold. The forces are

Fz1

= 5498 N ,

Fz2

= 2813 N .

23.1.2 Vehicles with More Than Two Axles

If more than two axles are present, even in symmetrical conditions the system remains
statically indeterminate and it is necessary to take into account the compliance of the
suspensions (Fig. 23.2a). The equilibrium equations (23.3) still hold, provided that
the terms

where distances xi are positive for axles located forward of the centre of mass and
negative otherwise.

For computation of normal loads on the ground a number (n − 2) of equations,
where n is the total number of axles, must be added. Each one of them simply
expresses the condition that the vertical displacement of the point where each inter-
mediate suspension is attached to the body is compatible with the displacement of
the ﬁrst and the last.

To account for possible nonlinearities of the force-displacement curves of the
suspension, it is advisable to compute a reference position in which each suspension
)0. The linearized stiffness of the ith suspension, possibly taking
exerts a force (Fzi
into account the compliance of the tires as well, is Ki . The vertical displacement of
the point where the ith suspension is attached is

With reference to Fig. 23.3, the vertical displacement of the vehicle body in the
point where the ith suspension is attached can be expressed as a function of the
displacement of the ﬁrst and nth suspension by the equation

equation is obtained,

The mentioned reference condition can be referred to any value of the load or any
position of the centre of gravity, provided that the values of the linearized stiffnesses
)0 can all be set to zero if
are the same as those in the actual condition. Forces (Fzi
the springs are linear and the suspensions are such that a position (i.e. a vertical and
a pitch displacement) exists in which all wheels just touch the ground, exerting on it
vanishing forces (neglecting the weight of the axles).

Equations (23.8), together with the second and third equation (23.3), form a set

of n equations that can be solved to yield the n normal forces acting on the axles.

Remark 23.1 Forces Fzi can never become negative: If a negative value is obtained,
it means that the relevant axle loses contact with the ground and the computation
must be repeated after setting the force to zero due to the relevant axle. The procedure
is repeated until no negative force is present.

23.1.3 Articulated Vehicles

In the case of articulated vehicles with a tractor with two axles and one or more trailers
with no more than a single axle each (Fig. 23.2), the computation is straightforward.
In this case, the equilibrium equations of the tractor are

moments are computed with reference to point O, and the aerodynamic forces and
moments are those exerted on the tractor only.

Similarly, the equilibrium equation of the trailer are

(23.10)
where the number of axles of the trailer is assumed to be m (in the present case
m = 1), the moments are computed with reference to point O(cid:4), the aerodynamic
forces and moments are those exerted on the trailer only and xi are the coordinates
of the axle in the reference frame centred in O(cid:4). Note that all xi are usually negative.
The last two equations (23.9), together with the last two equations (23.10) are
sufﬁcient only on level road at a standstill, when force Fxt vanishes. If it is other than
zero the ﬁrst equation (23.9) must also be used. However, the forces Fxi it contains
are not known since they depend on the normal forces Fzi . A simple iterative scheme
= 0, repeating the computation
can be used, to compute the normal forces with Fxt
until a stable solution is found. If the wheels of the trailer exert driving or braking
forces, these forces must also be introduced into the computation.

If the tractor has more than two axles or the trailer has more than one, additional
equations must be introduced. The additional (n − 2) equations of the tractor (n is the
number of axles of the tractor), are Eq. (23.8) while the additional (m − 1) equations
for the trailer, where m is the number of its axles, are

)0 is the normal force in the same axle in any reference

The ﬁrst two terms of Eq. (23.11) are linked to the vertical displacement of the
hitch, and the equation expresses the displacements of the hitch, the last axle and the
relevant axle.

The number of unknowns and equations is then equal to the total number of
axles plus one, since the normal force the two parts of the vehicle exchange is also
unknown. When force Fxt does not vanish, it must be computed iteratively, as seen
above.

Example 23.2 Compute the force distribution on the ground of the ﬁve-axle articu-
lated truck of Appendix E.10 at sea level, with standard pressure and temperature, in
the following conditions:

(a) at standstill on level road;
(b) at standstill on a 10% grade;
(c) driving at 70 km/h on a 10% grade;

The air density in the mentioned conditions is 1.2258 kg/m3.

(a) The static load distribution on level road can be computed directly, as the horizon-
tal force exchanged between the two parts of the vehicle vanishes. The unknowns
are six, the loads of the ﬁve axles and the vertical force exchanged between tractor
and trailer. These can be computed from the set of linear equations

The forces acting on the axles are then 58.660 kN, 105.700 kN, 80.060 kN,
83.600 kN and 56.050 kN. The force at the tractor-trailer connection is 94.210 kN.
(b) A 10% grade corresponds to a grade angle α = 5.7◦. In this case the load distribu-
tion can also be computed directly, since the horizontal force exchanged between
the two parts of the vehicle does not depend on the normal forces. Operating as

23.1 Load Distribution on the Ground

259

in the previous case, the forces acting on the axles are 45.050 kN, 115.720 kN,
78.900 kN, 84.490 kN and 58.000 kN. The forces at the tractor-trailer connection
are 90.980 kN in the vertical direction and 31.236 kN in the horizontal direction.
(c) At 70 km/h = 19.44 m/s the value of (cid:2)x is 3.7 mm for all tires. In this case,
owing to rolling resistance, an iterative solution must be obtained. However, the
convergence is very fast, as only ﬁve iterations are needed to reach a difference
between the results at the ith and at the (i − 1)th iteration smaller than 10−6
in relative terms. The other results are not dissimilar to those obtained in the
previous case: The forces on the axles are 43.980 kN, 116.970 kN, 78.710 kN,
84.440 kN and 58.060 kN; those at the tractor-trailer connection are 91.150 kN
in the vertical direction and 33.440 kN in the horizontal direction.
Note that the matrix of the coefﬁcients of the relevant set of equations is the
same in all cases.

23.2 Total Resistance to Motion

Consider a vehicle moving at constant speed on a straight and level road. The forces
that must be overcome to maintain a constant speed are aerodynamic drag and rolling
resistance.

By using the simpliﬁed formula seen in Part I to express the dependence of rolling

resistance on speed, the modulus of the ﬁrst is

(cid:2)

(cid:21)

Rr =

Fzi

f0 + K V 2

(cid:22)

,

∀i

(23.12)

where Fzi is the force acting in a direction perpendicular to the ground on the ith
wheel.

Assuming that the rolling coefﬁcient f is the same for all wheels,2 the sum of all
normal forces can be brought out from the sum and, taking into account aerodynamic
lift as well, it follows that

(cid:21)

Rr =

f0 + K V 2

(23.13)

Aerodynamic drag (or, better, the aerodynamic force in the x direction, Eq.(21.11))

has a value (always as an absolute value) of

Ra = 1
2

ρVr

2 SCx .

(23.14)

2This assumption holds only as a ﬁrst approximation, since it does not take into account the depen-
dence of f on the driving or braking conditions or other variables.

260

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

With increasing speed, the importance of the former grows; at a given value of
the speed aerodynamic drag becomes more important than rolling resistance. This
speed is lower for small cars while for larger vehicles, particularly for trucks at full
load, rolling resistance is the primary form of drag. Another factor is that usually the
mass of the vehicle grows with its size more rapidly than the area of its cross section.
If the road is not level, the component of weight acting in a direction parallel to

the velocity V , i.e. the grade force

R p = mg sin(α)

(23.15)

must be added to the resistance to motion.

The grade force becomes far more important than all other forms of drag even for
moderate values of grade (Fig. 23.1). Since the force acting in a direction perpendic-
ular to the ground on a sloping road is only the component of weight perpendicular
to the road, the total resistance to motion, or road load, as it is commonly referred
to, can be written in the form
mg cos(α) − 1

ρV 2 SCx + mg sin(α),

ρV 2 SCz

(23.16)

R =

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

where, assuming that the air is still, the velocity with respect to air Vr becomes
conﬂated with velocity V.

To highlight its dependence on speed, the road load can be written as

R = A + BV 2 + C V 4,

(23.17)

where

A = mg [ f0 cos(α) + sin(α)] ,

B = mgK cos(α) + 1
2

ρS[Cx − Cz f0],

C = − 1
2

ρS K Cz.

The last term in Eq. (23.17) becomes important only at very high speed in the case

of vehicles with strong negative lift: It is usually neglected except in racing cars.

Since the grade angle of roads open to vehicular trafﬁc is usually not very large,

it is possible to assume that

cos(α) ≈ 1,

sin(α) ≈ tan(α) ≈ i,

where i is the grade of the road. In this case coefﬁcient B is independent of the grade
of the road and

A ≈ mg( f0 + i)

depends linearly on it. C never depends on grade.

23.3 Power Needed for Motion

261

23.3 Power Needed for Motion

The power needed to move at constant speed V is obtained simply by multiplying
the road load given by Eq. (23.17) by the value of the velocity

Pn = V R = AV + BV 3 + C V 5.

(23.18)

Example 23.3 Plot the curves of the road load of the car of Appendix E.1 on level
road and on a 10% grade. Plot the curve of the power needed for constant speed
driving on level road.

The results obtained through Eq. (23.16) are shown in Fig. 23.4.

The results obtained through Eq. (23.16) are shown in Fig. 23.5. Note that in this
case aerodynamic drag amounts to a relatively small part of the road load and that
on a 10% grade the grade force is very high.

Motion at constant speed is possible only if the power available at the wheels at
least equals the required power given by Eq. (23.18). This means that the engine
must supply sufﬁcient power, taking into account losses in the transmission as well,
and that the road-wheel contact must be able to transmit this power.

When assessing the longitudinal performance of motor vehicles, it is often expe-
dient to plot the power required for motion as a function of speed on a logarithmic
plot. If the term C V 5 is neglected, the two remaining terms of Eq. (23.18) are rep-
resented by straight lines with slopes respectively equal to 1 and 3. The two straight
lines cross in a point whose x-coordinate is the so called characteristic speed, easily
obtained from Eq. (23.18)

Vcar =

(23.19)

Its y-coordinate is the logarithm of half the corresponding characteristic power

(Fig. 23.6), whose value is:

(cid:23)

.

The plot of the power required for motion cannot be obtained directly by adding
the ordinates of the two straight lines of Fig. 23.6: the power must be computed from
its logarithm, the values of the powers given by the straight lines added to each other,
and the logarithm computed once again.

placement depends only on the value of f0, and obviously on the slope i of the
road.

refer to a level road with f0 = 0.013. For high values of the slope the plot holds only if m = 1000
kg; S = 1.7 m2; Cx = 0.42; K = 6.5 × 10−6 s2/m2; g = 9.81 m/s2;ρ = 1.22 kg/m3

It is then possible to obtain a single logarithmic plot containing a set of curves
Pn(V ) for different values of α that can be used for any vehicle in the range where
cos(α) ≈ 1. Such a plot must be adapted to any particular vehicle by computing the
values of characteristic speed and power (Vcar , Pcar ) on level road. If the value of the
rolling coefﬁcient f0 coincides with the reference value f0r used to plot the diagram,
the reference value of the slope ir shown on the plot is the actual one, otherwise

Such a plot holds for any vehicle in the zone characterized by low values of α.
The error made using Fig. 23.7 for other vehicles increases with increasing α, but
remains negligible for values of i up to 0.3–0.4.

23.4 Available Power at the Wheels

The engine drives the wheels through a mechanical transmission whose task is essen-
tially that of reducing the angular velocity of the engine to that required at the wheels.
If a reciprocating internal combustion engine is used, the transmission also has the
task of uncoupling the engine from the wheels at a stop or at low speed, for which
reason the driveline includes a clutch or a torque converter as well.

It is possible, at least as a ﬁrst approximation, to state a value of the efﬁciency ηt

for any type of driveline. The power available at the wheels is then

Pa = Peηt .

(23.25)

Depending on the type of transmission, the efﬁciency can be considered as a
constant (obviously only as a ﬁrst approximation), or may be computed, but only
after assessing the working conditions of the driveline and above all of the torque
converter, if present.

To compute the efﬁciency of the driveline, or the power it dissipates, see the

relevant section of Part II.

The equation linking the speed of the engine to that of the wheels is simply

V = (cid:3)e Reτt ,

(23.26)

where τt is the overall gear ratio, deﬁned as the ratio between the speed of the wheels
and that of the engine shaft, and is usually smaller than 1. Once the gear ratios of all
parts of the transmission are known, the power available at the wheels can be plotted
as a function of the speed of the vehicle on the same plot where the power needed
for motion at constant speed is reported.

If the curves of the required and available power are plotted on a logarithmic
plot, any change of the gear ratio causes a translation of the curve related to the
available power along the V -axis, while a change in the efﬁciency of the driveline
causes a translation of the same curve along the P-axis (Fig. 23.8). If a continuous
transmission (CVT) is present, the position of the curve is a function of the gear ratio,
and then it is possible to deﬁne a zone on the V P-plane where all possible working
conditions are included.

See Part II for situations where a torque converter is present.

23.5 Maximum Power That can be Transferred to the Road

The power needed to overcome the road load must be transferred through the road-
wheel contact. As it increases with both increasing speed and the grade of the road,
there is a limit on the maximum speed that can be reached and the maximum grade
that can be managed because of this limit on the driving force the vehicle can exert,
even if no limit to the power supplied by the engine exists.

The maximum power that can be transferred by the vehicle is

Pmax = V

Fzi μi p

,

(cid:2)

∀i

(23.27)

where the sum is extended to all the driving wheels.

Remark 23.2 If the maximum longitudinal force coefﬁcient μi p and the load acting
on the driving wheels were independent of speed, the maximum power would increase
linearly with V . The optimum engine characteristic Pe((cid:3)e) for a vehicle with a
transmission with ﬁxed ratio would be a linear characteristic. This is not the case,
however, as the situation is far more complicated.

To begin with, consider the case of a vehicle with two axles, all of which are
driving and assume that all wheels work with the same longitudinal slip, i.e. that the
values of μi are equal. This situation will be referred here to as “ideal driving force”.

The maximum power that can be transferred to the road is then

23.5.1 Vehicles with All Wheels Driving

When all wheels are driving wheels, it is possible to assume that the rolling resistance
of the wheels is due only to the forward displacement of force Fz at the road-wheel
contact, and hence is overcome directly by the driving torque exerted by the engine.
To compute the maximum grade that can be managed at low speed, it is possible
to assume that the only road load that must be overcome at the wheel-road contact at
such speeds is the grade load. By equating the power required for motion (Eq. 23.18)
to the maximum power that can be transferred (Eq. 23.28), the maximum grade is
readily obtained,

tan(αmax ) = imax = μx p

.

(23.29)

To compute the maximum speed that can be reached, the decrease of traction at
the road-wheel contact occurring with increasing speed must be modelled. A very
simple way is to assume a linear law

μi p

= c1 − c2V.

(23.30)

By equating the power required for motion at constant speed (except that related
to rolling resistance) to Eq. (23.28) and using Eq. (23.30) for expressing the decrease
of the available driving force with the speed, the maximum speed can be obtained
from the cubic equation

The values of the maximum grade and of the maximum speed can only be achieved
in ideal conditions, since the longitudinal slip of all wheels has been assumed to be the
same. The forces acting on the driving axles can be computed by using the procedure
already seen: They generally depend not only on the static load distribution but also
on the speed and the acceleration.

In the case of a vehicle with two axles, both driving, the ratio

K T = Fx1
Fx2

between the driving force at the front wheels and that at the rear wheels is usually a
constant. If the wheels all have the same diameter, it coincides with the ratio between
the driving torques supplied to the two axles. Assume that the two axles have tires

268

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

of the same type and operate on patches of road with the same characteristics. If

K T

Fz2
Fz1

> 1,

the limit conditions occur at the front wheels. At the onset of slipping, the power that
can be transferred to the road is then

Pmax = V μx p Fz1

1 + K T
K T

.

(23.32)

By plotting the maximum power obtained by Eq. (23.32) versus the speed together
with the power required given by Eq. (23.17) multiplied by V , the maximum speed
at which the vehicle is able to transfer enough power to maintain its speed is readily
obtained. It must be remembered that rolling resistance must be neglected in the
computation of the required power.

If, on the contrary,

K T

Fz2
Fz1

< 1,

the limit conditions occur at the rear wheels and the maximum power that can be
transferred to the road is

Pmax = V μx p Fz2

(1 + K T ).

(23.33)

The maximum grade that can be managed is also easily obtained. Since in this

case the speed can be set to zero, it follows that, for an all-wheel drive vehicle,

tan(αmax ) = imax =

,

or if this condition does not hold. It is, however, unlikely that the rear wheels are in a
critical condition on a very steep grade, since this would require an abnormally low
value of K T . The value of μx p is that for a vanishingly small speed.

23.5 Maximum Power That can be Transferred to the Road

269

23.5.2 Vehicles with a Single Driving Axle

If not all axles are driving, the power that can be transferred to the ground is smaller.
Aerodynamic drag increases the load on the rear wheels, as does a positive grade
of the road: The power that can be transferred by a rear-wheels drive vehicle thus
increases with speed, due to drag, and with the slope. Aerodynamic moment and lift
have different effects depending on the sign of the moments and the position of the
centre of mass. The maximum power is then

Pmax = V μx p Fz1

,

Pmax = V μx p Fz2

,

(23.35)

respectively for the cases of front and rear wheel drive. Only the rolling resistance
of the free wheels must be accounted for in the computation of the power needed for
constant speed driving; this is easily done by introducing Fz2 or Fz1 , respectively for
front- and rear-wheels drive, in the expression of the road load instead of the total
load on the ground.

Equation (23.34) could still be used for the computation of the maximum grade
that can be managed. The ﬁrst equation holds for front-wheel drive (1/K T = 0)
and the second for rear-wheel drive, (K T = 0) but they do not include the rolling
resistance of the free wheels.

If this effect is accounted for, the equations are modiﬁed as

(23.36)

Example 23.5 Plot the curves of maximum transmissible and required power for the
vehicle of Appendix E.2 on dry and wet road. Compute the maximum speed and the
maximum grade that can be managed.

Repeat the computations assuming that the same vehicle has rear-wheel drive,

without changing the static load distribution on the ground.

Assume that c1 = 1.1 and c2 = 6 × 10−3 s/m on dry road and c1 = 0.8 and c2 =

8 × 10−3 s/m on wet road.

The curves of the maximum transmissible power are shown in Fig. 23.9, together
with those of the required power. The vehicle of the example can thus reach a max-
imum speed of 225 km/h (wet road) or 308 km/h (dry road) for reasons linked only
to the wheel driving force.

The computations were repeated assuming that the driving wheels are the rear
ones. In this case, the maximum power that can be transferred to the ground at low
speed is lower than in the previous case, since the static load distribution was speciﬁed
in order to obtain good performance with front-wheel drive.

270

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

Fig. 23.9 Maximum
transmissible power and
required power on level road
in the case of Example 23.5

The load on the rear wheels increases with increasing speed and eventually gets
larger than that on the front wheels. On dry road, the maximum speed is then higher
for the vehicle with rear-wheel drive, despite the fact that at standstill the front wheels
are loaded by about 60% of the weight.

The values of the maximum speed for the rear-wheel drive vehicle are of 218 km/h

on wet road or 328 km/h on dry road.

Note that the required power curve includes only the rolling resistance of the

non-driving wheels, and is slightly different in the two cases.

Also note that the curves do not take into consideration the load shift due to
acceleration, so for speeds lower than the maximum speed, where the vehicle would
accelerate if the maximum power is applied, they are not realistic.

The maximum grade angle that can be managed when only the wheel driving
force is considered may be computed using Eq. (23.36), obtaining 28.0◦ on dry road
and 22.1◦ on wet road, corresponding to grades of 53.1% and 40.6% respectively. If
the driving wheels were the rear ones the values would have been 29.4◦ (56.3%) and
20.6◦ (37.6%).

In the case of rigid axles in which the ﬁnal gear is directly mounted on the axle
and the propeller shaft is in the longitudinal direction, the drive torque Md applied
to the axle causes a transversal load shift between the driving wheels of the same
axle.

With reference to Fig. 23.10 the load shift (cid:2)Fz could be determined easily as

(cid:2)Fz = Md
ti

where Md = Fx Rlτ f ,

(23.37)

Fx is the longitudinal force exerted by the axle on the ground and τ f is the gear ratio
of the ﬁnal drive, deﬁned as the ratio between the speed of the wheels and that of the
propeller shaft (it is usually smaller than unity).

23.5 Maximum Power That can be Transferred to the Road

271

Fig. 23.10 Transversal load
shift due to the driving
torque Td

Equation (23.37) is not, however, usually correct as under the action of the driving
torque the vehicle body is subject to a roll rotation, which in turn produces an added
torque on the axle through the suspension system. If the roll stiffness of the ith
suspension is Kti , the roll angle is

The torque exerted on the axle is then equal to

φ = − Md(cid:28)

.

∀i Kti

φKt = − Md Kt(cid:28)

where Kt is the roll stiffness of the relevant suspension.

∀i Kti

(23.38)

If the vehicle has a standard differential gear, the maximum driving force which
can be exerted by the driving axle is equal to twice that which can be exerted by the
less loaded wheel, i.e.

Fxmax

= μ p(Fz − 2(cid:2)Fz).

(23.39)

If, on the contrary, a locking differential is used, within the limits of the assumption
that the force coefﬁcient μ p is independent of the load, the transversal load shift does
not affect the maximum driving force.

272

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

Example 23.6 Consider the articulated truck of Appendix E.10. Compute

(a) the maximum driving force at a constant speed of 70 km/h on level road;
(b) the same as in (a), but on a 10% grade;
(c) the maximum grade that can be managed at 10 km/h.

All the above computations must be performed taking into account the transver-
sal load shift and repeated for the case of a locking differential. Assume that the
maximum longitudinal force coefﬁcient is μ p = 1.

(a) At 70 km/h = 19.44 m/s the load on the driving axle is 106.940 kN while the
required driving force is 3.187 kN. Taking into account the gear ratio of the ﬁnal
drive, the driving torque on the axle is 344 Nm, yielding a roll angle of 2.67◦.
The transversal load shift is (cid:2)Fz = 96.4 N , and the maximum longitudinal force
is 106.75 kN. This value compares with the 106.94 kN that could be exerted if a
locking differential were used, showing that the latter would improve the ability
to exert longitudinal forces only marginally in this case.

(b) At 70 km/h on a 10% grade the load on the driving axle is 116.97 kN and the
required driving force is 91.15 kN, corresponding to a driving torque on the axle
of 4453 Nm. A very large roll angle, namely 34.6◦, results from the values of
the stiffness of the axles, but this is an unrealistic result as for large torques the
nonlinear nature of the suspensions would limit rotations. Assuming that the
stiffness distribution between the suspensions in the nonlinear range is the same
as in the linear range, the transversal load shift is (cid:2)Fz = 1249N , yielding a
maximum longitudinal force of 114.47 kN; if a locking differential were used, a
force of 116.97 kN would have been exerted.

(c) By computing the force required for motion and the maximum force that can be
exerted by the driving wheels at 10 km/h = 2.78 m/s for different values of the
grade, it is possible to ﬁnd the value of the latter at which the two are equal. This
procedure allows one to ﬁnd the maximum value of the grade as 34.9%, i.e. a
grade angle of 19.2◦.
Note that the driving torque is very large on that grade and the suspensions
operate clearly outside their linear range: The load shift can thus be far smaller
than that computed. If no load shift was accounted for, a value of the grade of
37.8%, i.e. a grade angle of 20.7◦, would have been found.

23.6 Maximum Speed

The maximum speed that can be reached on level road with a given transmission
ratio can be found by intersecting the curve of the available power at the wheels
with that of the required power on level road. The transmission ratio causing this
intersection to occur at the maximum available power allows the highest speed that
can be attained by a given vehicle-engine combination (curve 1 in Fig. 23.11) to be
reached.

23.6 Maximum Speed

Fig. 23.11 Maximum speed

combustion engine

273

The computation of the maximum speed and of the overall gear ratio τt necessary
to reach it is straightforward. By intersecting the required power curve with the
horizontal straight line

P = Pamax

= Pemax ηt ,

a ﬁfth degree equation is obtained

AV + BV 3 + C V 5 = Pemax ηt ,

(23.40)

whose solution directly yields the maximum value of the speed.

If aerodynamic lift is neglected (actually it is sufﬁcient to neglect the contribution
to rolling resistance proportional to the square of the speed due to lift), C vanishes
and the equation is cubic. Its solution can be obtained in closed form

Once the maximum speed has been obtained, the gear ratio allowing the vehicle

τt =

Vmax
Re((cid:3)e)Pmax

,

(23.42)

where ((cid:3)e)Pmax is the engine speed at which the peak power is obtained.

If the transmission is of the mechanical type, the overall gear ratio is the product

of the gear ratio at the gearbox (in the relevant gear) and that of the ﬁnal drive

τt = τgτ f .

The top speed gearbox transmission ratio τg can be calculated having established
the differential ﬁnal transmission ratio τ f . Note that the top speed gear in usually not
the last one in the gearbox, because in modern cars, where the top speed is usually
higher than what is allowed on roads and motorways, one or two more ratio are
provided for improving fuel economy and decreasing engine noise.

Note that this procedure is based on the assumption that the intersection in
Fig. 23.11 occurs at the peak of the engine power curve. This can, however, occur
in only one given condition, since not only the load, but also the rolling resistance
coefﬁcient and even the air density, affect the road load curve. Air density also affects
the engine power curve. If the intersection occurs in the descending branch of the
curve (situation 2 in Fig. 23.11) the vehicle is said to be “undergeared ”, i.e., the
overall transmission ratio is “too short”. Conversely, if the intersection occurs in the
ascending branch of the curve (situation 3 in Fig. 23.11), the vehicle is “overgeared
” and the overall transmission ratio is “too long”.

The ﬁrst situation can be purposely obtained to improve the acceleration and grade
performance of the vehicle, while the second allows fuel consumption to be reduced.
The degree of undergearing λu can be deﬁned as

λu =

((cid:3))Vmax
((cid:3))Pmax

.

(23.43)

It is greater than unity if the vehicle is undergeared and smaller than 1 in case of
overgearing.

There are thus two ways of choosing the top gear ratio: One has already been
stated, namely a “fast” gear ratio, with a degree of undergearing equal to about unity,
i.e., chosen in order to reach the maximum speed.

23.7 Gradeability and Initial Choice of the Transmission

Ratios

The maximum grade that can be managed with a given gear ratio may be obtained by
plotting the curves of the required power at various values of the slope and looking for
the curve that is tangent to the curve of the available power (Fig. 23.12). The slope so

23.7 Gradeability and Initial Choice of the Transmission Ratios

275

Fig. 23.12 Maximum slope
for a vehicle with internal
combustion engine

obtained is, however, only a theoretical result, since it can be managed only at a single
value of the speed: If the vehicle travels at a higher speed, it slows down because
the power is not sufﬁcient, but if its speed is reduced the power is insufﬁcient and
the vehicle slows down further: The condition is therefore unstable and the vehicle
stops.

To be able to manage a speciﬁed slope safely, the curve of the available power
must be above that of the required power in a whole range of speeds, starting from a
value low enough to assure that starting on that slope is possible. To choose a value
of the gear ratio of the bottom gear allowing the vehicle to start on a given grade, it
is possible to state a reference speed and to compute the gear ratio in such a way that
at that speed the Pa and Pn curves intersect.

As the vehicle is moving at low speed, only the ﬁrst term of the required power
curve needs to be accounted for. As the power developed by the engine can be written
in the form

Pe = Me(cid:3)e = Me

V
Reτgτ f

,

where Me is the engine torque, the equilibrium condition allows the overall gear ratio
to be computed as

(23.44)

(23.45)

τt =

Meηt
Remg[ f0 cos(α) + sin(α)]

.

The value of the engine torque to be introduced into Eq. (23.45) can be the
maximum torque available at the minimum engine speed, possibly multiplied by a
number smaller than 1 for safety. The mass of the vehicle must be that at full load,

276

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

including the maximum trailer mass the vehicle is allowed to tow. For the grade,
values of 25% or even 33% for road vehicles can be considered, but it must be
kept in mind that in some cases, as in ferry ramps or private garage ramps, very
steep grades may be encountered. For off-road vehicles values up to 100% can be
considered.

Another consideration in the choice of the gear ratio for the bottom gear is to
assure a regular working of the engine at a speed chosen so as to avoid a prolonged
use of the clutch in very low speed driving. A reference value may be 6 or 8 km/h.
Both criteria must be satisﬁed.

Once the ratios of the bottom and top gears have been chosen, the intermediate
ones can be stated using different criteria. The simplest is to set them in geometric
sequence, i.e., stating that the ratios between two subsequent gear ratios are all equal.
Operating in this way, the available power curves on the P(V ) logarithmic plot are
all equispaced.

There may be some advantages in having the curves a bit closer to each other in
the high speed range, so that the third gear (in a four speed gearbox) is closer to the
fourth. If this is required, it is possible to set in a geometric sequence not the gear
ratios τi but the ratios between them τi /τi+1. This can give a feeling of sport driving,
since the gear ratios are more crowded in the zone of most common use.

The choice of the transmission ratios is much inﬂuenced by considerations that
are beyond the scope of the present section, being mostly linked to the acceleration
performance of the vehicle. This aspect was introduced in Part III and will be dealt
with in Sect. 23.10.

Remark 23.3 Since the values of the gear ratios have a large inﬂuence on the perfor-
mance of the vehicle and above all on the driver’s perception of them, the trade-off
dominating their choice is also a matter of subjective impressions and the traditions
of various manufacturers. The market sector a manufacturer aims at may have more
inﬂuence in deciding the matter than technical considerations alone.

Example 23.7 Choose the overall top gear ratio for the car of Appendix E.2 to reach
the maximum speed in the load condition indicated. Choose the bottom gear ratio to
start on a 33% grade with a safety margin of 1.1 with respect to the maximum engine
torque. Compare the ratio obtained with those listed in the Appendix.

Equation (23.40), solved numerically, yields a maximum speed of 42.6 m/s =

153.4 km/h.

The overall transmission ratio τgτ f allowing the intersection between the two
curves on the P(V ) plane to occur at the peak power is 0.3044. If a value of 22/21
= 1.048 is accepted for the top gear ratio, the transmission ratio of the ﬁnal drive is
0.2906, which can be approximated as 18/62 with an error of about 0.08%.

The actual ratio of the ﬁnal drive is 0.284. By computing the maximum speed
with this value of the transmission ratio, a value of 41.2 m/s = 148.36 km/h is found.
The top speed is reached at 5147 rpm, yielding a degree of undergearing λu = 0.99.
The overall transmission ratio of the bottom gear can be found using Eq. (23.45).
By dividing the maximum engine torque by a factor of 1.1, a value of 0.1056 is

23.7 Gradeability and Initial Choice of the Transmission Ratios

277

obtained, corresponding to a value for the gearbox ratio of 0.3639. This value is far
longer than the actual one (0.2154), since the computation was performed with the
vehicle unloaded.

23.8 Fuel Consumption at Constant Speed

The energy needed to travel at constant speed can be immediately computed by
multiplying the power required for constant speed driving by the time

e = Pnt = Pnd
V

,

(23.46)

where d is the distance travelled. Note that Eq. (23.46) gives the energy required at
the wheels: To obtain the energy actually required, it must be divided by the various
efﬁciencies.

In case of a conventional vehicle moved by an ICE, we need to know the efﬁciency
of the engine ηe and the thermal value H of the fuel to compute fuel consumption.
Introducing the expression derived from Eq. (23.16) for the total road load into the
expression for the power, the fuel consumption per unit distance Q f is

Q f = A + BV 2 + C V 4

,

ηt ηe H ρ f

(23.47)

where ρ f is the density of the fuel, introduced to obtain the consumption in terms of
volume of fuel per unit of distance. In S.I. units it is measured in m3/m, while liters
per 100 km is a more practical, although not consistent, unit. Often the reciprocal of
Q f , expressed in km per liter or miles per gallon, is used.

In case of a battery electric vehicle, the electric energy Qe at the battery electrodes

can be directly computed by

Qe = A + BV 2 + C V 4

,

ηt ηm

(23.48)

where ηm is the efﬁciency of the electric motor. In S.I. units it is measured in W/m,
while kW/100 km is a more practical, although not consistent, unit. Often the recip-
rocal of Qe, expressed in km per kW or miles per kW, is used.

In case of hybrid electric vehicles Eq. (23.47) or Eq. (23.48) apply according to
the fact that the vehicle is running on ICE or on electric motor. Note that these two
extreme situations occur respectively at high and at very low speed; at intermediate
speeds, the vehicle is driven contemporarily by ICE and electric motor and the last
can absorb or deliver mechanical energy according to the control strategy of the
hybrid system. The formula is now

,

ηt ηe H ρ f

(23.49)

where Pe is the electric power internally recycled and ηht is the mechanical efﬁciency
of the transmission connecting the ICE with the electric motor/generator. Note that
Pe is the power measured at the battery electrodes and if the purpose of the calculation
is to evaluate the charge depletion the charge/discharge battery efﬁciencies must be
taken into account.

From Eq. (23.47), if the aerodynamic lift is neglected and, in case of a conventional
vehicle, the fuel consumption would be a quadratic function of the speed if the
efﬁciency of the engine could be considered as a constant. The plot Q f (V ) for a car
with a mass of 1,000 kg, with H = 4.4 × 107 J/kg, ρ = 730 kg/m3 and ηe = 0.25 is
shown in Fig. 23.13.

This is not the case, however, as the efﬁciency of the engine is strongly inﬂuenced
by its rotational speed and above all by the power the engine is required to supply.
To compute the consumption Q, the simplest procedure is to obtain the power
required at the wheels as a function of the speed and hence to compute the power the
engine must supply to travel at constant speed

Pe = Pn
ηt

.

Once the transmission ratio has been stated, the rotational speed of the engine is
known and thus the working point on the map of the engine is located. From it the
efﬁciency ηe or, which is the same, the speciﬁc fuel consumption

is obtained and the fuel consumption can be computed as

(23.50)

The curves Q(V ) are of the type shown in Fig. 23.14. They usually have a min-
imum at low speed, obtained in conditions in which the engine works at low power
with low efﬁciency.

Since the conditions in which the engine works depend on the overall transmission
ratio, the fuel consumption is also largely inﬂuenced by the value of the gear ratio.
Usually the longer the ratio, the lower the consumption, as a “long” ratio allows the
engine to be used at low speed in conditions which are close to the maximum power,
where the speciﬁc fuel consumption is low.

As already stated, a transmission ratio longer than that needed to reach the maxi-
mum speed can be used. It is possible to choose it in such a way that the curve of the
required power crosses that of the maximum efﬁciency at a given cruise speed, e.g.
at a speed equal to 3/4 of the top speed. The fuel consumption at that speed is con-
sequently the minimum possible value, with the added advantages of a reduction in
noise and engine wear due to the reduced engine speed. Obviously, the performance
in terms of maximum speed, acceleration and gradeability is reduced with respect to
that available with a shorter gear ratio.

280

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

If a CVT is used, it is possible to control it in such a way that the engine works at
conditions of maximum efﬁciency at all speeds, i.e. at all speeds the working point
on the map lies on the curve of the maximum efﬁciency. This is really expedient,
however, only if the increase in efﬁciency so obtained is greater than the loss of
efﬁciency, with respect to that of a simpler transmission, due to the use of the CVT.
Moreover, the control law for the transmission ratio of the CVT is a trade-off among
different requirements, which also take into account acceleration and gradeability.

Example 23.8 Plot the fuel consumption curve in top gear for the car of Appendix E.2.
The map of the engine is shown in Fig. 23.15a. The curves of the power required
at the engine, i.e. of the power required at the wheels divided by the transmission
efﬁciency, are plotted for the different gear ratio in the same ﬁgure.

The curves identify the working conditions of the engine.

curves of power required at the engine in various gears (1: bottom gear; 2, 3: intermediate gears; 4:

The other columns list the speciﬁc fuel consumption, the speed and the fuel
consumption (in l/100 km) and its reciprocal (in km/l). A value of 730 kg/m3 has been
used for the density of the fuel. The fuel consumption is also reported in Fig. 23.15b.
The experimental data do not allow the fuel consumption to be computed directly
in the other gears, since the required power curves do not cross the curves of the
map. Although there is no difﬁculty in repeating the tests and plotting the speciﬁc
fuel consumption in the relevant zone of the map, not having other experimental data
available it is still possible to interpolate linearly the values of the efﬁciency between
the lowest curve and the (cid:3)-axis where the efﬁciency is zero.

To interpolate the efﬁciency means to interpolate the reciprocal of the speciﬁc fuel
consumption4; consequently, the curve midway between the curve at 400 gCV/h and
the (cid:3)-axis is that related to a doubling of the fuel consumption, 800 gCV/h, and
so on. The lower part of the plot of Fig. 23.15a, obtained in this way, is shown in
Fig. 23.15c.

The fuel consumption curves (Fig. 23.15d) were then obtained in the same way
seen above for the top gear. The results are only a rough approximation, but at any
rate their pattern is realistic.

23.9 Vehicle Take-Off from Rest

Since internal combustion engines cannot operate below a minimum speed (cid:3)min, the
vehicle cannot slow down below the speed

Vmin = (cid:3)min Reτ f τg

with the engine connected to the driving wheels. Either a torque converter or a friction
clutch must be used, both for starting and stopping the vehicle and to facilitate the
shifting of gears.

4To interpolate directly on the speciﬁc fuel consumption has little meaning, since the latter tends to
inﬁnity on the (cid:3)-axis.

282

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

The starting manoeuvre may be easily simulated in an approximate way by accept-

ing the following assumptions:
1. The manoeuvre is started with the engine running at a speed (cid:3)e0 and the clutch
control is released gradually from time t = 0 to time t = ti in such a way that the
torque Mc it transmits increases linearly in time from 0 to the maximum value
it can handle in slipping conditions M ∗
c , and then remains constant until time ts
when no more slipping occurs;

2. the engine torque is maintained constant at the value Me;
3. if the vehicle starts on a sloping road, it is kept stationary by some external means

until the clutch torque is sufﬁcient to produce motion;

4. the longitudinal slip of the wheels is small;
5. the terms in V 2 and V 4 of the road load are neglected owing to the low speed at

which the manoeuvre is performed.

The vehicle can be modelled in terms of two moments of inertia, one to model
the engine Je and one to model the vehicle Jv (Fig. 23.16a). The ﬁrst includes the
moment of inertia of the engine, up to the ﬂywheel, while the moments of inertia of
the clutch disks, of the shaft entering the gearbox, of all the rotating parts (reduced to
the engine shaft), and the mass of the vehicle as “seen” from the engine are included
in the second. For the computational details, see Sect. 23.10.

Torque Me, which has been assumed to be constant, acts on the moment of inertia

Je. On Jv a drag torque Mv is acting, whose value is simply

when the vehicle is moving. When the vehicle is stationary, at the beginning of
the starting manoeuvre, the drag torque is simply equal to the torque the clutch is

(23.52)

The maximum torque the clutch can transfer to the vehicle M ∗

c is usually slightly

larger, by 10–20%, than the maximum engine torque.

The torques acting on the system are plotted versus time in Fig. 23.16b. The

manoeuvre can thus be subdivided into three phases:
1. From t = 0 to

t = t0 = ti

M ∗
v
M ∗

,

in which the vehicle is at a standstill, since the torque transferred by the clutch is
not yet sufﬁcient to overcome the drag. The engine speeds up.

2. From t = t0 to t = ti , the clutch slips, the vehicle accelerates and the engine
c becomes greater than Me, it starts to

initially continues to speed up, but when M ∗
slow down.

3. From t = ti to t = ts, the clutch continues to slip until time ts, when the transmis-
sion starts to behave as a rigid system and the acceleration continues, as will be
seen in Sect. 23.10.

By integrating Eq. (23.53) separately for the three phases, the following time

histories for the engine and for the vehicle are obtained:

(23.62)

To make the subsequent acceleration of the vehicle possible, the angular velocity
of the engine at time ts must be in excess of the minimum velocity at which it can
work regularly; otherwise, it stops. This can occur if the values of (cid:3)e0 or of Me are
too low or if the clutch engages too quickly (ti too low).

If ts < ti the vehicle completes the starting manoeuvre before the clutch is fully
engaged: This poses no problem, but Eq. (23.62) fails to yield a correct value of ts.
During the manoeuvre, the engine delivers an energy equal to the difference

Example 23.9 Simulate a starting manoeuvre for the car of Appendix E.2. Assume
that the manoeuvre is started at 2000 rpm with the engine supplying a torque equal
to 60% of the maximum torque while the clutch can transfer a torque equal to 120%
of the maximum torque. Assume that ti = 0.5 s, but repeat the computations for ti =
0.2 s and ti = 0.8 s.

With simple computations it follows that the moment of inertia simulating the
c = 104.4

vehicle is Jv = 0.2113 kg m2 and that M ∗

Remark 23.4 The efﬁciency of the clutch is lower than the value 0.5 which is often
assumed. Actually, it would be 0.5 if the engine rotates at constant speed with no
drag acting on the inertia that has to be accelerated.

The assumptions made are quite rough, particularly those on the laws Me(t)
and Mc(t). However, the results do allow one to obtain reference values that are
independent of the actual behavior of the driver.

In cases where the transmission has a torque converter instead of a clutch, the
torque entering the gearbox may be computed using the equations discussed in Part
II. It is then possible to integrate the equations of motion numerically and to obtain
the time history of the speed.

In the case of a servo-controlled clutch, a procedure similar to the one shown can

be followed by introducing the relevant control laws.

23.10 Acceleration

If the curve of the required power lies, at a certain speed, below that of the power
available at the wheels, the difference Pa − Pn between the two is the power available
to accelerate the vehicle.

Remark 23.5 Note that the engine power Pe is usually measured in steady-state
running, in which case using it for acceleration is arbitrary; however, the time scales
of the acceleration of the crankshaft and of the thermodynamic cycle are different
by orders of magnitude, and thus the error introduced by using the values obtained
from the steady-state map is negligible. The driving torque is then almost the same
in steady-state conditions and in acceleration, but in the latter case part of the engine
torque is used to accelerate the engine itself.

Consider a vehicle with a mechanical transmission with a number of different gear
ratios. During acceleration a number of rotating elements (wheels, transmission, the
engine itself) must increase their angular velocity, and it is expedient to write an
equation linking the engine power with the kinetic energy T of the vehicle

ηt Pe − Pn = dT
dt

.

(23.66)

The transmission efﬁciency should not be included for the part or the engine power
needed to accelerate the engine, but the error created as a result is usually negligible.
Once the transmission ratio has been chosen, Eq. (23.26) gives the relationship
between the speed of the vehicle and the rotational speed of the engine. Similar
relationships may be used for the other rotating elements that must be accelerated
when the vehicle speeds up.

The kinetic energy of the vehicle can then be expressed as

(cid:2)

(23.67)

where the sum extends to all rotating elements which must be accelerated when the
vehicle speeds up. The term me is the equivalent or apparent mass of the vehicle,
i.e., the mass of an object that, when moving at the same speed as the vehicle, has
the same total kinetic energy. Usually it is written in the form

me = m + Jw

(23.68)

where Jw is the total moment of inertia of the wheels, which are assumed to have
the same radius and hence to rotate at the same speed, and of all elements rotating
at their speed, Jt is the moment of inertia of the propeller shaft and of all elements
of the transmission, and Je is the moment of inertia of the engine, the clutch and all
the elements rotating at speed (cid:3)e.

To account for the fact that the engine is accelerated directly, at least in an approx-
imate way, the last term is sometimes multiplied by ηt . The modiﬁcations to Eq.
(23.68) to take the presence of different wheels on different axles into account are
obvious.

Of the three last terms the ﬁrst is usually small, the second negligible, while the
third may become very important, particularly in low gear. As only the last term
depends on the transmission ratio at the gearbox, the equivalent mass can be written
in the form

me = F + G

(23.69)

(23.66) yields

As the equivalent mass is a constant, once the gear ratio has been chosen, Eq.

.

(23.70)

Equation (23.70) holds only in the case of constant equivalent mass. If a CVT or
a torque converter is used, the overall transmission ratio, and hence the equivalent
mass, changes in time and the equation should be modiﬁed as

The plot of maximum acceleration versus speed for a passenger vehicle with a

The minimum time needed to accelerate from speed V1 to speed V2 can be com-

puted by separating the variables in Eq. (23.73)

dt = meV d V
ηt Pe − Pn

(23.74)

and integrating

(23.75)

The integral must be performed separately for each velocity range in which the
equivalent mass is constant, i.e. the gearbox works with a ﬁxed transmission ratio.
Although it is possible to integrate Eq. (23.75) analytically if the maximum power
curve is a polynomial, numerical integration is usually performed.

A graphical interpretation of the integration is shown in Fig. 23.19: The area under

the curve

V me
ηt Pe − Pn

a

versus V is the time required for the acceleration.

The speeds at which gear shifting must occur to minimize acceleration time are
readily identiﬁed on the plot 1/a(V ). Since the area under the curve is the acceleration
time or the time to speed, the area must be minimized and gears must be shifted at
the intersection of the various curves. If they do not intersect, the shorter gear must
be used up to the maximum engine speed.

A criterion for choosing the gear ratios can also be evolved. The lower envelope of
the curves (dashed line in the ﬁgure) does not depend on the transmission ratios and
may be thought of as the curve that can be followed using a CVT having the same
efﬁciency as the gearbox and optimized to obtain the maximum acceleration. The
area under the dashed curve is the minimum time to speed under ideal conditions.

23.10 Acceleration

time curve for the vehicle

ﬁgures

291

The areas between the dashed and the continuous lines account for the time which
must be added due to the presence of a ﬁnite number of speeds: The transmission
ratios can be chosen in such a way as to minimize this area.

By increasing the number of speeds the acceleration time is reduced, since the
actual curve gets closer to the ideal dashed line. However, at each gear shifting there
is a time in which the clutch is disengaged and, consequently, the vehicle does not
accelerate: Increasing the number of speeds leads to an increase in the number of
gear shifts and thus of the time wasted without acceleration. This restricts the use of
a high number of gear ratios.

The speed-time curve at maximum power can be easily obtained by integrating Eq.
(23.75). An example is shown in Fig. 23.20. The actual curve, obtained by adding the
time needed for gear shifting, is also reported. The speed is assumed to be constant
during gear shift.

By further integration it is possible to obtain the distance needed to accelerate to

Instead of modelling the vehicle as an equivalent mass accelerated along the road,
it is sometimes modelled as an equivalent moment of inertia attached to the ﬂywheel
of the engine, as seen in the previous section. Its value is

The acceleration curves can thus be obtained in terms of acceleration of the engine

instead of acceleration of the vehicle.

It is possible to choose the gear ratio of the bottom gear to optimize the acceleration
at low speed. When the transmission ratio is shortened, the torque available at the
wheels increases; however, the equivalent mass also increases and it is not convenient,
from the viewpoint of acceleration, to use transmission ratios that are too short.

Assuming that the engine torque Me is constant and discarding the terms in V 3
and V 5 in the required power since at low speed their contribution is negligible, Eq.
(23.73), written for the case of level road, yields

By differentiating Eq. (23.80) with respect to τg and equating the derivative to

the acceleration, is obtained. If the road load is neglected, which is reasonable on
level road when dealing with strong accelerations, the value of the optimum gear
ratio is

The last value has been obtained by neglecting the terms representing the inertia
of the wheels and transmission in the expression of the equivalent mass. Note that
the value so obtained leads to equal contributions for the mass of the vehicle and the
inertia of the engine in the equivalent mass.

The value of the transmission ratio obtained with this criterion is, however, too
short: It usually yields driving torques exceeding the maximum torque that may be
transmitted by the driving wheels without slipping.

Example 23.10 Plot the acceleration curve for the vehicle in Appendix E.2 and com-
pute the time needed to reach 100 km/h. Compute also the time needed to travel for
1 km from standstill.

Assume that the time needed for gear shifting is 0.5 s and that the takeoff manoeu-

vre follows the results obtained in the previous example.

Constants F and G are F = 855.2 kg and G = 15.96 kg, leading to the following

values of the equivalent mass and moment of inertia:

The results of the numerical integration yielding the speed and the distance trav-
elled as functions of time during an acceleration are shown in Fig. 23.21. They were
computed based on the results obtained in the previous example with a time ti = 0.5
s, namely a time of 0.59 s, a speed of 9.22 km/h and a distance of 0.494 m.

The engine power was introduced in the computation through the best-ﬁt third
degree polynomial found in Example 22.1, and the speeds at which gear shifting
occurs were determined as the minimum value between that corresponding to the
maximum speed of the engine (6000 rpm) and the speed at which the acceleration
obtainable in the following gear equals that obtainable with the gear under consid-
eration. They are

5784 rpm (V = 34.3 km/h)
6000 rpm (V = 60.6 km/h)
6000 rpm (V = 102.3 km/h)

for the ﬁrst gear,
for the second gear,
for the third gear.

The time to reach a speed of 100 km/h is 16.3 s and that needed to reach the 1 km

mark is 38.1 s.

The same procedures and considerations can be applied to battery electric vehicles
and hybrid electric vehicles. In the ﬁrst case the procedure is simpliﬁed because there
is no clutch and a single transmission ratio is placed between the electric motor and
the driving wheels. In the second case the vehicle can be simulated as a conventional
one on which the engine power is increased by the contribution of the electric motor;
therefore, the performance should be calculated at fully charged and fully discharged
battery.

23 Driving Dynamic Performance

23.11 Fuel Consumption in Actual Driving Conditions

Fuel consumption at variable speed gives the customer a more reliable estimate of
the actual fuel consumption, but its determination is much more difﬁcult. For this
reason, several simpliﬁcations are usually accepted.

The ﬁrst describes the actual use of the vehicle through a cycle, i.e. a time history
of the speed of the vehicle, that takes into account neither the behavior of an actual
driver nor the actual road and trafﬁc conditions. This time history is used for all
vehicles.

This simpliﬁcation is implicitly accepted by European standards, which establish
an urban and a suburban cycle to evaluate fuel consumption. These cycles were
described in Part I. Fuel consumption measured in these cycles is the only value that
may be supplied to the customer, and must be expressly stated on the data sheet of
the vehicle.

Different cycles, obtained directly by manufacturers on similar vehicles in actual
operating conditions may give more realistic values, but they are useful only to
designers; this subject has also been covered in Part I.

A second simpliﬁcation is that of computing the fuel consumption in a cycle as
the sum of the partial consumption obtained in the various parts that approximate
the chosen cycle assuming quasi-steady-state operation.

It is clear that the error so introduced decreases with decreased duration of the
parts of the cycle that are assumed to be steady state; the error, however, is also
due to the fact that fuel consumption in variable conditions is different from the
fuel consumption obtained by approximating them with a sequence of steady state
operations. This is due to the following reasons:
• In non-stationary operation, the thermal conditions of the engine are variable,
so that the thermal energy losses are different from those occurring when the
temperature has reached its steady-state value;

• in non-stationary conditions, part of the fuel burns with a lower efﬁciency due to
condensation of the vapor on the intake manifold in indirect injection engines, or
to a different evaporation rate of the fuel droplets in direct injection engines.

The difference is never very large, particularly if the instant power required by the
cycle is much lower than the maximum engine power; this occurs often in statistically
relevant cycles, since trafﬁc conditions are always such as to prevent the engine from
obtaining maximum performance. The comparison between measured and computed
data always shows differences between 2 and 5%, with the computed consumption
always lower than the actual one, due to the mentioned causes.

Following the above mentioned simpliﬁcations, the reference cycle is subdivided
into a series of short time intervals; experience shows that a duration of about 1 s is
acceptable for the intervals.

If Vi is the speed at instant ti of the cycle, the fuel consumption (cid:2)e f i in the time

interval from ti to ti+1 will be, in case of a conventional vehicle moved by an ICE

Note that the energy contribution (cid:2)ei can be negative in case of deceleration at
least for the fraction of the power that the electric motor is able to recover; the power
in excess will be lost in the brakes and cannot be taken into account.

Remark 23.6 The performance of batteries is much inﬂuenced by their temperature,
the current at which the charge and discharge takes place and many other parameters.
A detailed model of the battery is thus required to achieve a sufﬁcient precision, and
on this topics many papers and books have been written, for instance.5 These models
are anyway quite complex, and applicable only to particular types of batteries.

In case of hybrid electric vehicles the previous equations apply according to
the fact that the vehicle is running on ICE only or on electric motor. Note that

driven contemporarily by ICE and electric motor and the last can absorb or deliver

In the case of a conventional vehicle with an ICE, the equation holds if the value
of the ﬁrst term in brackets is positive or vanishes, that is if the vehicle accelerates
or decelerates with a rate low enough to compensate for the road load with inertia
forces. If its value is negative, the contribution must be set to zero, since controllers
on all modern engines cut off the fuel supply as the vehicle slows.

The contribution to fuel consumption when Vi = 0 is

(cid:2)e f i = Qi (ti+1 − ti ),

(23.86)

where Qi is the fuel consumption at idle in L/s; it must be set to zero in case of

and in case of battery electric vehicles the total energy consumption is

(23.88)

An idea of the relative importance of the various forms of resistance to motion
on fuel consumption in actual conditions is given by Fig. 23.22, where two different
driving conditions are considered. Although the ﬁgure was obtained for a particular
car (a medium sized saloon car), the results are typical. While in motorway driving
aerodynamic drag is important, most of the energy in urban driving is expended to
accelerate the vehicle.

The average was computed by using statistical data on average European condi-
tions. From the average it is clear that reducing the mass of the vehicle, which affects
both rolling resistance and the power needed to accelerate, is more important than
reducing aerodynamic drag, and that the possibility of recovering braking energy,
which allows a part of the energy used to accelerate the vehicle to be recovered,
allows important energy savings to be obtained.

Numerical simulations can be used to study the effects of driving style on fuel
consumption. In city driving, it is expedient to use the engine at the lowest speed
consistent with its regular operation and particularly to maintain it near the speed
of maximum torque and maximum efﬁciency. Prolonged use of low gears increases
consumption without increasing the average speed appreciably (Fig. 23.23).

Chapter 24
Braking Dynamic Performance

The study of braking on straight road is performed using mathematical models similar
to those seen in Chap. 23 for longitudinal dynamics. But in this case, the presence
of suspensions and the compliance of tires are neglected and the motion is described
by the longitudinal equilibrium equation (23.1) alone

m ¨x =

Fxi .

(cid:2)

∀i

Apart from cases in which the vehicle is slowed by the braking effect of the engine,
which can dissipate a non-negligible power (lower part of the graph of Fig. 22.5),
and by regenerative braking in electric and hybrid vehicles, braking is performed in
all modern vehicles on all wheels. Subscript i thus extends to all wheels or, when
thinking in terms of axles, as is usual for motion in symmetrical conditions, on all
axles.

24.1 Braking in Ideal Conditions

Ideal braking can be deﬁned as the condition in which all wheels brake with the same
longitudinal force coefﬁcient μx .

The study of braking forces the vehicle can exert will follow the same scheme
seen in Sect. 23.5, the only obvious difference being that braking forces, like the
corresponding longitudinal force coefﬁcients and the longitudinal slip, are negative.
Normal forces between road and tires can be computed using the equations seen in
Sect. 23.1, remembering here as well that the acceleration is negative.

The total braking force Fx is thus

Fx =

μxi Fzi

,

(cid:2)

where the sum extends to all the wheels. The longitudinal equation of motion of the
vehicle is then

where m is the actual mass of the vehicle and not the equivalent mass, and α is
positive for uphill grades. The rotating parts of the vehicle are slowed directly by the
brakes, and hence do not enter into the evaluation of the forces exchanged between
vehicle and road. These parts must be accounted for when assessing the required
braking power of the brakes and the energy that must be dissipated.

Aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance can be neglected in a simpliﬁed study of
braking, since they are usually far smaller than braking forces. Also, rolling resistance
can be considered as causing a braking moment on the wheel more than a direct
braking force on the ground.

Since in ideal braking all force coefﬁcients μxi are assumed to be equal, the

acceleration is

(24.3)

On level road, for a vehicle with no aerodynamic lift, Eq. (24.3) reduces to

d V

= μx g.

(24.4)

The maximum deceleration in ideal conditions can be obtained by introducing

the maximum negative value of μx into Eq. (24.3) or (24.4).

The assumption of ideal braking implies that the braking torques applied on the
various wheels are proportional to the forces Fz, if the radii of the wheels are all
equal.

As will be seen later, this may occur in only one condition, unless some sophisti-
cated control device is implemented to allow braking in ideal conditions. If μx can
be assumed to remain constant during braking, the deceleration of the vehicle is
constant, and the usual formulae hold for computing the time and space needed to
slow from speed V1 to speed V2:

(24.5)

(24.6)

24.1 Braking in Ideal Conditions

The time needed to stop the vehicle increases linearly with the speed while the

space increases quadratically.

To compute the forces Fx the wheels must exert to perform an ideal braking
manoeuvre, forces Fz on the wheels must be computed ﬁrst. This can be done using
the formulae in Sect. 23.1. However, for vehicles with low aerodynamic vertical
loading, such as all commercial and passenger vehicles with the exception of racers
and some sports cars, aerodynamic loads can be neglected. Drag forces can also be
neglected and, in the case of a two-axle vehicle, the equations reduce to

The plot of Eq. (24.14) in the Fx1 ,Fx2 plane is a parabola whose axis is parallel to
the bisector of the second and fourth quadrants if a = b (Fig. 24.1). The parabola is
thus the locus of all pairs of values of Fx1 and Fx2 leading to ideal braking.

Only a part of this plot is actually of interest: That with negative values of the
forces (braking in forward motion) and with braking forces actually achievable, i.e.
with reasonable values of μx (Fig. 24.2).

On the same plot it is possible to draw the lines with constant μx1 , μx2 and accel-
eration. On level road, the ﬁrst two are straight lines passing, respectively, through
points B and A, while the lines with constant acceleration are straight lines parallel
to the bisector of the second quadrant.

Remark 24.1 All forces here relate to the axles and not to the wheels: In the case of
axles with two wheels their values are then twice the values referred to the wheel.

The moment to be applied to each wheel is approximately equal to the braking
force multiplied by the loaded radius of the wheel: If the wheels have equal radii, the
same plot holds for the braking torques as well. If this condition does not apply, the
scales are simply multiplied by two different factors and the plot, though distorted,
remains essentially unchanged.

24 Braking Dynamic Performance

Remark 24.2 To perform a more precise computation, the rolling resistance, which
is a small correction, should be accounted for and the torque needed for decelerating
the rotating inertias should be added. This correction is important only for driving
wheels and braking in low gear, but in this case the braking effect of the engine,
which is even more important and has the opposite sign, should be considered.

As stated before, the law linking Fx1 to Fx2 , i.e. Mb1 to Mb2 to allow braking in
ideal conditions, depends on the mass and the position of the centre of mass. For
passenger vehicles, it is possible to plot the lines for the minimum and maximum load
and to assume that all conditions are included between them; for industrial vehicles,
the position of the centre of mass can vary to a larger extent, and a larger set of load
conditions should be considered.

The curves for three different types of passenger vehicles are shown in Fig. 24.3 as

(Mb1

24.2 Braking in Actual Conditions

The relationship between the braking moments at the rear and front wheels is in
practice different from that stated in order to comply with the conditions needed to
obtain ideal braking, and is imposed by the parameters of the actual braking system
of the vehicle.
A ratio

Kb = Mb1
Mb2

between the braking moments at the front and rear wheels can be deﬁned. If all
wheels have the same radius, its value coincides with the ratio between the braking
forces.

Remark 24.3 This statement neglects the braking moment needed to decelerate rotat-
ing parts. This can be adjusted by considering Mb as the part of the braking moment
that causes braking forces on the ground; the fraction of the braking moment needed
to decelerate the wheels and the transmission must be added to it.

For each value of the deceleration a value of Kb allowing braking to take place
in ideal conditions can be easily found from the plot of Fig. 24.2. Kb depends on the
actual layout of the braking system, and in some simple cases is almost constant.

In hydraulic braking systems, the braking torque is linked to the pressure in the

hydraulic system by a relationship of the type

Mb = (cid:4)b(Ap − Qs),

(24.15)

where (cid:4)b, sometimes referred to as the efﬁciency of the brake, is the ratio between
the braking torque and the force exerted on the braking elements and hence has the

24.2 Braking in Actual Conditions

305

dimensions of a length. A is the area of the pistons, p is the pressure and Qs is the
restoring force due to the springs, when they are present.

The value of Kb is thus

or, if no spring is present as in the case of disc brakes,

Kb = (cid:4)b1
(cid:4)b2

(A1 p1 − Qs1
(A2 p2 − Qs2

)
)

,

Kb = (cid:4)b1 A1 p1
(cid:4)b2 A2 p2

.

(24.16)

(24.17)

In disc brakes, (cid:4)b is almost constant and is, as a ﬁrst approximation, the product
of the average radius of the brake, the friction coefﬁcient and the number of braking
elements acting on the axle, since braking torques again refer to the whole axle. If the
pressure acting on the front and rear wheels is the same, the value of Kb is constant
and depends only on geometrical parameters.

The behavior of drum brakes is more complicated, as restoring springs are present
and the dependence of (cid:4)b on the friction coefﬁcient is more complex. As stated in
Part I, shoes can be of the leading or of the trailing type. If leading, the braking torque
increases more than linearly with the friction coefﬁcient and there is even a value of
the friction coefﬁcient for which the brake sticks and the wheel locks altogether.

The opposite occurs with trailing shoes and (cid:4)b increases less than linearly with

the friction coefﬁcient.

The efﬁciency of the brakes is a complex function of both temperature and velocity
and, during braking, it can change due to the combined effect of these factors. When
the brake heats up there is usually a decrease of the braking torque, at least initially.
Later an increase due to the reduction of speed can restore the initial values. This
“sagging” in the intermediate part of the deceleration is more pronounced in drum
than in disc brakes. With repeated braking, the overall increase of temperature can
lead to a general “fading” of the braking effect.

If Kb is constant, the characteristic line on the plane Mb1 , Mb2 is a straight line

through the origin (Fig. 24.4).

The intersection of the characteristics of the braking system with the curve yielding
ideal braking deﬁnes the conditions in which the system performs in ideal conditions.
On the left of point A, i.e. for low values of deceleration, the rear wheels brake less
than required and the value of μx2 is smaller than that of μx1. If the limit conditions
occur in this zone, i.e. for roads with poor traction, the front wheels lock ﬁrst.

On the contrary, all working conditions beyond point A are characterized by

μx2

> μx1

and the rear wheels brake more than required, i.e., the braking capacity of the front
wheels is underexploited. In this case, when the limit conditions are reached, the rear
wheels lock ﬁrst, as in the case of Fig. 24.4.

ideal braking, characteristic

which the front or the rear

shown the value of μ p is
high enough to cause sliding
beyond point A

From the viewpoint of handling, it is advisable that

μx2

< μx1 ,

since this increases the stability of the vehicle; the characteristics of the braking
system should lie completely below the line for ideal braking. Locking of the rear
wheels is a condition that must be avoided since it triggers directional instability.

In A the ideal conditions are obtained: If the limit value of the longitudinal force

coefﬁcient occurs at that point, simultaneous locking of all wheels occurs.

The values of ratio Kb for which the ideal conditions occur at a given value of the

It is possible to deﬁne an efﬁciency of braking as the ratio between the acceleration
obtained in actual conditions and that occurring in ideal conditions, obviously at

is higher,

The ﬁrst value holds when the rear wheels lock ﬁrst (above point A in Fig. 24.4),

the second when the limit conditions are reached at the front wheels ﬁrst.

A typical plot of the braking efﬁciency versus the peak braking force coefﬁcient

is plotted in Fig. 24.5.

The value of the maximum longitudinal force coefﬁcient μ p at which the condition
ηb = 1 must hold can be stated and the value of ratio Kb can be easily computed. For
values of |μ p| lower than the chosen one, the rear wheels lock ﬁrst while for higher
values locking occurs at the front wheels.

Once Kb is known, the braking system can easily be designed. The curve ηb(μx )
can be plotted by assigning increasing values to the pressure in the hydraulic system,
computing Kb and then the values of μx and ηb referred to the front and rear wheels.
The result is of the type shown in Fig. 24.5, curve (a) or (b).

Operating in this way, the rear wheels lock when the road is in good condition.
To postpone the locking of the rear wheels, curves of the type of line (b) can be used,
but this reduces efﬁciency when the road conditions are poor.

To avoid locking of the rear wheels without lowering efﬁciency at low values of
μx , a pressure proportioning valve, i.e., a device that reduces the pressure in the rear
brake cylinders when the overall pressure in the system increases above a given value,

may be used. A linear reduction of the pressure on the rear brakes with increasing

(24.28)

where ρc is a characteristic constant of the valve, can be assumed.

Pressure pi and constant ρc must be chosen in such a way that the device starts
acting when the efﬁciency ηb gets close to unity. The reduction of the rear pressure
must be such that it does not cause locking of the rear wheels; nor should it be so
high as to substantially lower the efﬁciency (see Fig. 24.5, curve (c)).

To comply with these conditions in all load conditions of the vehicle, pi and,
possibly, ρc must vary following the load. A possible way to achieve this is to monitor
the load on the rear axle, e.g., by monitoring the vertical displacement of the rear
suspension.

The characteristic line in the Mb1 , Mb2 plane of a device operating along this line

is reported in Fig. 24.6.

To prevent wheels from locking, antilock systems (ABS) act directly to reduce
the pressure in the hydraulic cylinders of the relevant brakes when the need to reduce
the braking force arises. Modern devices are based on wheel speed sensors allowing
the actual speed of the wheels and the speed corresponding to the velocity of the
vehicle to be compared. If a slip that exceeds the allowable limits is detected, the
device acts to reduce the braking torque, restoring appropriate working conditions.
As will be shown in detail in Chap. 27, ABS systems may work in different ways,

both in the physical characteristics of the system and in the control algorithms.

The above braking efﬁciency holds only in the case of rigid vehicles. If the pres-
ence of suspensions is accounted for, the load transfer from the rear to the front
wheels does not occur immediately, and at the beginning of the braking manoeuvre

(24.28) is present. To take
into account the variability
of the parameters of the
system, speciﬁcally the
friction coefﬁcient, a band of
characteristics has been
considered instead of a
single line. The ideal braking
lines at the two different load
conditions have also been
plotted

the vertical loads on the wheels are the same as those at constant speed. The body
of the vehicle then starts to dive and the load on front wheels increases, until steady
state conditions are reached and the loads take the values given by Eqs. (24.7) and
(24.8). This effect actually depends largely on the characteristics of the suspensions:
the rotation of the body can be very small and load shift is almost immediate when
antidive arrangements are used.

The load on the rear wheels is higher and the locking of the rear wheels is more
difﬁcult at the beginning of the manoeuvre: This consideration explains the practice
of giving short brake pulses, effective when modern braking systems designed to
avoid rear wheel locking were not available.

Example 24.1 Plot the braking efﬁciency of the car of Appendix E.2, assuming that
the braking system is designed to reach the ideal conditions for a longitudinal force
coefﬁcient μx = −0.4. Use a pressure proportioning valve in such a way that the
front wheels lock before the rear ones up to a value of μx equal to unity. Neglect
aerodynamic forces and rolling resistance.

where all forms of drag have been neglected.

The brakes cannot dissipate this power directly; they usually work as a heat sink,
storing some of the energy in the form of thermal energy and dissipating it in due
time. Care must obviously be exerted to design the brakes in such a way that they
can store the required energy without reaching excessively high temperatures and
so that adequate ventilation for cooling is ensured. The average value of the braking
power must, at any rate, be lower than the thermal power the brakes can dissipate.

Two reference conditions are usually considered: Driving in continuous
acceleration-braking cycles, and downhill running in which the speed is kept constant
with the use of brakes.

In the ﬁrst case, neglecting all resistance to motion, the energy to be dissipated
during braking from speed V to zero is equal to the kinetic energy of the vehicle.

24.3 Braking Power

311

The worst case is a number of accelerations from standstill to speed V , performed
in the lowest possible time, followed by braking to standstill. The average power on
an acceleration-deceleration cycle is

|P| = meV 2
2(ta + tb)

.

(24.30)

The acceleration time ta increases with V and can be computed with the method

used in the previous chapter. Braking time tb is, at least,

tb =

V
gηb|μxmax

.

|

The average braking power ﬁrst increases with the speed V , and then decreases
again since the acceleration time increases far more than the braking energy. When
the vehicle is approaching its maximum speed, ta tends to inﬁnity and the average
power tends to zero.

In the case of downhill driving, the speed is assumed to be held constant by the
use of brakes. The average power is then coincident with the power to be dissipated
in each instant, since it is not possible that in the long run large quantities of heat are
stored in the brakes. It then follows:

|P| = |V mg sin(α)|.

(24.31)

The power that must be dissipated increases linearly with V . The speed must then
be limited, and the braking effect of the engine must be exploited on long downhill
slopes.

Industrial vehicles are sometimes supplied with devices to maintain constant speed
when driving downhill to prevent the brakes from over-heating. By limiting the speed
as a function of α, that is by stating a function V = V (α), the average power can be
expressed as a function of the speed of the type shown in Fig. 24.8.

Acceleration-deceleration cycles are usually the critical condition for passenger
vehicles and, above all, for sports cars, while for industrial vehicles the worst condi-
tion is downhill driving. Plots of the type seen in Fig. 24.8 give an indication of the
maximum value of the average power the brakes must dissipate, making them useful
for designing their cooling system.

If the road conditions or the driving style require signiﬁcant use of the brakes,
they may be required to store much heat and become very hot, with consequent
thermo-mechanical problems. To give an idea of the magnitude of the temperatures
reached by some components of the braking system, some experimental temperature
readings obtained on mountain and hill roads are reported in Fig. 24.9.

In vehicles with regenerative braking capabilities, the average power computed
above gives an idea of how much energy can be stored, and thus determines the
capacity of the accumulator. An accumulator able to store braking energy is large

enough to provide true hybrid capabilities, i.e., to uncouple the requirements of the
vehicle from the instantaneous power of the engine.

At any rate, vehicles with regenerative braking must have a conventional braking
system as well. Regenerative braking is usually performed on only one axle, usually
the driving axle, with the exception of schemes such as that shown in Fig. 22.18a1.
Braking power is limited by both the transmission and the ability of the accumulator to
accept high power levels. The conventional braking system works in less demanding
conditions, since it provides emergency braking only rather than frequent slowing in
normal use.

Handling Performance

25.1 Low Speed or Kinematic Steering

25.1.1 Two-Axle Vehicles Without Trailer

Low speed or kinematic steering is, as already stated, deﬁned as the motion of a
wheeled vehicle determined by pure rolling1 of the wheels. The velocities of the
centres of all the wheels lie in their midplane, that is the sideslip angles αi are
vanishingly small. In these conditions, the wheels cannot exert any cornering force
to balance the centrifugal force due to the curvature of the path. Kinematic steering
is possible only if the velocity is vanishingly small.

Kinematic steering of two-axle vehicles without trailer was dealt with in detail in
Chap. 4 (Sect. 4.2). Here only the value of the path curvature gain needs be recalled,

1
Rδ

= 1
l

.

(25.1)

Remark 25.1 The path curvature gain is a linearized value, holding only if the radius
of curvature of the path R is much larger than the wheelbase. It is independent of the
steering angle and of the curvature of the path.

Another important transfer function of the vehicle is ratio β/δ, usually referred
to as sideslip angle gain. The sideslip angle of the vehicle, referred to the centre of
mass, may be expressed as a function of the radius of the path R as

1The term ‘pure rolling’ is often used to indicate rolling without slip. ‘Free rolling’, as opposed
to ‘tractive rolling’, is used to indicate rolling without exerting tangential (longitudinal or lateral)
forces (K.L. Johnson, Contact Mechanics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1985). Here
the two terms are considered as equivalent, because a tire must operate in slip (longitudinal or side
slip) conditions to produce a tangential force.

(25.3)

As seen in Chap. 6, the optimal condition for kinematic steering of a four-wheel
steering vehicle (4WS) is equal and opposite steering angles of the two axles: the
radius of the path is thus halved with respect to the same vehicle with a single steering
axle.

Particularly in the case of long vehicles, the off-tracking distance, i.e., the differ-
ence of the radii of the trajectories of the front and the rear wheels, is an important
parameter. If Ra is the radius of the path of the front wheels, the off-tracking distance
is

In the same way, it is possible to deﬁne a minimum steering radius between walls,
that is the diameter of the largest circle described by any point of the vehicle at
maximum steering. If the point following the curve with the largest radius is point
A in Fig. 25.1 (note that the ﬁgure refers to a vehicle with three axles), the minimum
steering radius is

(25.6)

25.1.2 Vehicles with More Than Two Axles Without Trailer

True kinematic steering of vehicles with more than two axles is possible only if the
wheels of several axles (all except one) can steer, and if the steering angles comply
with conditions similar to those seen in Chap. 6 for the steering axle of a two-axle
vehicle. In order to avoid serious wear to the tires, it is possible to lift one axle
from the ground in certain conditions: In some countries it is legal to design the
suspensions in such a way that not all axles are on the ground when the vehicle is
unloaded, while in others this is not allowed. Some axles can be lifted for low-speed
manoeuvring while being in contact with the ground in normal driving.

Some axles may also be self-steering, i.e. the wheels are allowed to orient them-
selves to minimize sideslip. An axle of this type clearly cannot exert side forces

and reduce the overall cornering ability of the vehicle. Different laws hold in differ-
ent countries, sometimes allowing the use of self-steering axles in normal driving
and sometimes specifying that self-steering axles be blocked except in low speed
manoeuvres. In the case of a three-axle vehicle with non-steering axles close to each
other, an approximation such as the one shown in Fig. 25.1 can be used to study low
speed steering.

25.1.3 Vehicles with Trailer

If the vehicle has a trailer with one or two axles, with the front axle on a dolly attached
to the draw bar, kinematic steering is always possible if the tractor allows it.

Generally speaking, if the wheels of the trailer are ﬁxed, the trailer follows a path
which is internal to that of the tractor. In the case of the vehicle of Fig. 25.2a radius
RR is

(cid:8)

If these equations can be linearized, the value of ratio θ/δ, i.e. the trailer angle

gain, is

where l A is positive if point A is outside the wheelbase. Distance l A + l R is the
distance between the axle of the trailer and the rear axle of the tractor.

In the case of Fig. 25.2b, the radius of the path of the trailer can be obtained by

considering the latter as two subsequent trailers of the type already considered.

The only way to prevent the trailer from following a path internal to that of the
tractor is to provide its wheels with a steering mechanism (Fig. 25.3). The steering
angle of the last axle must be opposite to the one of the tractor.

25.1 Low Speed or Kinematic Steering

317

Fig. 25.3 Kinematic

+ 2l R RR sin (δR) .

(25.11)

The difference between the radii of the trajectories of the trailer and the tractor can
thus be reduced, allowing the space needed by the vehicle in a bend to be reduced.
However, this method is not free from drawbacks, since the driver cannot visually
control the rear part of the trailer that, at the beginning of the bend, seems to move
outwards.

This last problem is sometimes solved by placing a second driver in the rear of
the trailer to control the relevant steering mechanism, or better, by using an actuator
controlled by a suitable control law from the steering control, to steer the trailer. The
dynamic problems linked with the steering of trailers will be dealt with later.

If the radius of the path is much larger than the wheelbase, the radius of the path of

and the linearized relationship linking the steering angles of the tractor and of the
trailer is

This relationship is actually between the moduli of the angles, since they must

have opposite signs.

The trailer angle gain is then

The mechanism controlling the steering of the trailer is usually not driven by the
steering wheel but by the drawbar, because of which angle δR does not depend on δ
but on θ. Assuming a linear relationship between the two angles

Remark 25.2 The path of the trailer is circular only after a certain time: When the
tractor starts to follow a circular path there is an initial transient in which the path of
the trailer starts to bend, followed by the period of time needed to reach the steady
state conditions.

The path of the trailer, or better of point R in Fig. 25.2a, can be computed as
follows. In Fig. 25.4a the vehicle is sketched in its initial conﬁguration with the
trailer and tractor aligned; the generic conﬁguration at time t is shown in Fig. 25.4b.
In the second ﬁgure, the tractor is rotated by an angle α and the trailer is rotated by
an angle β. Note that angle φ is positive if A lies between B and C.

The positions of the centre of rotation of the tractor O and of the trailer O1 at time
t and t + dt are shown in Fig. 25.5. Distances RR(cid:4), AA(cid:4) and RR(cid:4)(cid:4) are very small if
compared with AR and A(cid:4)R(cid:4). Neglecting vanishingly small quantities, it follows that

A long trailer on a narrow bend requires a change of direction of more than 90◦

before steady-state conditions are reached and its path becomes almost circular.

The low-speed steering of a vehicle with a trailer with two axles like the one
shown in Fig. 25.1b can be dealt with using the same equations seen above, applied
to both the simple trailers modelling the actual two-axle trailer. The path of the ﬁrst

trailer (the dolly) is initially not circular, and this must be taken into account while
integrating numerically Eq. (25.19).

Example 25.1 Study the conditions for kinematic steering of the articulated vehicle
of Appendix E.10. Assume a value of the radius of the centre mass of the tractor of
10 m and compute the path of the trailer. Assume that the trailer has a single axle,
coinciding with the third axle of the actual trailer.

The radius of the trajectories of the front and rear axles of the tractor is easily
computed as 9.730 and 10.335 m; the off-tracking of the tractor is thus 605 mm.
The approximated expression (25.5) for the off-tracking yields 607 mm, very close
to the correct value even if the radius of the path is not actually very large compared
to the wheelbase (10 m vs. 3.485 m).

The steering angles of the front wheels are 17.99◦ and 21.77◦, with an average
value of 19.71◦. This value is also very close to the correct value of 19.88◦, obtained
without any linearization, and to the linearized value of 19.77◦.

The steady state radius of the path of the trailer is 5.446 m, yielding a value of

4.889 m for the total off-tracking distance.

The path of the trailer has been computed by numerically integrating Eq. (25.19)
for α included between 0 and 450◦, with a step of 0.5◦. The values of φ and R A are,
respectively, of 2.648◦ and 9.740 m. The path and the locus of points O(cid:4) are shown
in Fig. 25.6. Note that after a rotation of 90◦ the radius of the path is still larger than
that in steady-state conditions.

Example 25.2 Repeat the previous example, assuming that the trailer axle is steering
with a mechanism realizing law (25.17).

The value of K is 1.118. The equation allowing the path of the trailer to be
computed is the same as in the previous example, the only difference being that
reference is made to point H in Fig. 25.3 instead of point R in Fig. 25.4.

The radius of the steady-state path of the trailer is 9.942 m, very close to that of
the trailer. The steering angle of the trailer is δR = 20.02◦ and the angle between
the trailer and the tractor is θ = 19.76◦. The path of the trailer was computed by
numerically integrating the relevant equation for values of α from 0 and 450◦, with
increments of 0.5◦, as in the previous example. The path and the locus of points O(cid:4)
are plotted in Fig. 25.7. Note that steady-state conditions are quickly reached and
that at the beginning the trailer moves outwards.

25.2 Ideal Steering

If the speed is not vanishingly small, the wheels must move with suitable sideslip
angles to generate cornering forces. A simple evaluation of the steady-state steering
of a vehicle in high-speed or dynamic2 steering conditions may be performed as
follows. Consider a rigid vehicle moving on level road with transversal slope angle
αt and neglect the aerodynamic side force. Deﬁne a η-axis parallel to the road surface,
passing through the centre of mass of the vehicle and intersecting the vertical for the
centre of the path, which in steady-state condition is circular (Fig. 25.8). Axis η does
not coincide with the y axis, except at one particular speed.

25.2.1 Level Road

Assume that the road is ﬂat and neglect aerodynamic forces. The equilibrium equation
in η direction can be written by equating the centrifugal force mV 2/R to forces Pη

(25.21)

2The term dynamic steering is used here to denote a condition in which the path is determined by
the balance of forces acting on the vehicle, as opposed to kinematic steering in which the path is
determined by the direction of the midplane of the wheels. Note that dynamic steering applies to
both steady-state and unstationary turning.

25.2 Ideal Steering

Fig. 25.8 Simpliﬁed model for dynamic steering

For a ﬁrst approximation study, forces Pη may be conﬂated with the cornering
forces Fy of the tires and all wheels may be assumed to work with the same side
force coefﬁcient μy. As the last assumption is similar to that seen for braking in ideal
conditions, this approach will be referred to as ideal steering. These two assumptions
lead to substituting the expression

come from the danger of rollover occurring if the resultant of forces in the yz plane
crosses the road surface outside point A (Fig. 25.8).

The moment of the forces applied to the vehicle in the ηz-plane about point A is

that

Note that M is negative if the lift is directed downwards. To take aerodynamic lift
into account it is sufﬁcient to multiply the expressions seen in the previous section
by 1 − M V 2.

Term M V 2 is usually very small and often negligible, with the exception of racing
cars. For instance, let ρ = 1.22 kg/m3 (value at sea level in standard atmosphere), S =
1.7 m2, Cz = −0.5 (an already high value) and m = 1000 kg. It follows that M =
−5.3 × 10−5 s2/m2 and thus, at 100 km/h, the value of the additional term is 0.05. To
change things radically high speeds must be reached: at 300 km/h the additional term
becomes −M V 2 = 0.37, i.e. the maximum lateral acceleration increases by 37%.

The negative value of Cz is very high in racing cars, and at high speed strong

lateral accelerations are possible.

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

so that M V 2 is the ratio between the aerodynamic lift and the component of weight
in a direction perpendicular to the road.

By introducing the maximum value of the side force coefﬁcient μy p

into

Eq. (25.34), the maximum value of the lateral acceleration is obtained,

(25.35)

(25.36)

where the so-called sliding factor fs can be deﬁned as3

fs =

tan(αt ) + μy p

(1 − M V 2)

1 − μy p tan(αt )

and is in general a function of the speed, if the aerodynamic lift is accounted for.

Note that on level road and with no aerodynamic lift the sliding factor reduces to

μy p .

The sliding factor is reported as a function of μy p for different values of the
transversal slope of the road in Fig. 25.9a and for different values of ratio M V 2 in
Fig. 25.9b. Note that if the road is ﬂat and the aerodynamic lift is neglected it reduces
to the maximum value of the side force coefﬁcient μy p

.

3The sliding factor is more commonly deﬁned as the square root of the same quantity considered
here. The present deﬁnition, which refers directly to the lateral acceleration instead of the speed at
which a given turn may be negotiated, is here preferred as in particular conditions it reduces to the
side force coefﬁcient.

(25.41)

The expression of the rollover factor is identical to that of the sliding factor, once
ratio t/2hG has been substituted for μy p (Fig. 25.9). It depends on speed because of
the effects of aerodynamic lift.

The maximum lateral acceleration is then

(25.42)

Whether the limit condition ﬁrst reached is that related to sliding, with subsequent

fr . If fs < fr , as often occurs, the vehicle spins out. This condition can be written
in the form

μy p

< t
2hG

,

and coincides with that seen on level road. Neither aerodynamic lift nor a transversal
road slope have any inﬂuence on the possibility of rollover.

25.2.4 Considerations on Ideal Steering

The value of μy p at which rollover may occur is as high as 1.2–1.7 for sports cars,
1.1–1.6 for saloon cars, 0.8–1.1 for pickup and passenger vans and 0.4–0.8 for heavy
and medium trucks. Only in the latter case does rollover seem to be a possibility, at
least if the lateral forces acting on the vehicle are restricted to the cornering forces
of the tires.

The present model is only a rough approximation of the actual situation, as it is
based on the assumption that the side force coefﬁcients μy of all wheels are equal,
implying that all wheels work with the same sideslip angle α. It also ignores the effect
of the different directions of the cornering forces of the various wheels, which should
be considered as perpendicular to the midplanes of the wheels and not directed along
the η axis. The load transfer between the wheels of the same axle and the presence
of the suspensions have also been neglected, two other assumptions contributing to
the lack of precision of this model.

If the maximum speed at which a circular path can be negotiated is measured in a
steering pad test and the value of the lateral force coefﬁcient is computed through Eq.
(25.25), a value of μy p , well below that obtained from tests on the tires, is obtained.

25.2 Ideal Steering

329

Remark 25.3 The cornering force coefﬁcient obtained in this way is that of the
vehicle as a whole, and the difference between its value and that related to the tires
gives a measure of how well the vehicle is able to exploit the cornering characteristics
of its wheels.

The side force coefﬁcient measured on the whole vehicle also depends on the
radius of the path, with a notable decrease on narrow bends. The majority of indus-
trial and passenger vehicles are able to use only a fraction, from 50 to 80%, of the
potential cornering force of the tires, with higher values found only in sports cars.
This reduction of the lateral forces makes the danger of rollover more remote.

Actually rolling over in a quasi-static condition is impossible for most vehi-
cles, notwithstanding the fact that rollover actually occurs in many road accidents.
Rollover can usually be ascribed to dynamic phenomena in nonstationary conditions
or to lateral forces caused by side contacts, e.g. of the wheels with the curb of the
road, that rule out the possibility of side slipping while causing far stronger lateral
forces to be exerted on the wheels. The presence of the suspensions also contributes
to this picture, making rollover a likely outcome of many accidents.

From the equations it is also clear that only the use of aerodynamic devices able
to exert a strong negative lift allows high values of lateral acceleration, well above
1 g in the case of racers, to be reached (Fig. 25.10).

25.2.5 Vehicles with Two Wheels

The cornering dynamics of a vehicle with two wheels are radically different from
those of four-wheeled vehicles (Fig. 25.11). If the gyroscopic moments of the wheels
are neglected, the equation expressing rolling equilibrium can be used to compute
the roll angle the vehicle must maintain in order not to capsize, since a two-wheeled
vehicle is a system underconstrained in roll.

The limitation on lateral acceleration and speed on a curved path is solely the result
of lateral sliding, with a further geometric limitation on the maximum roll angle that
can be reached before the vehicle or the driver touches the road on one side. Equation
(25.24) yielding the maximum lateral acceleration still holds, the difference being
that the global side force coefﬁcient is usually higher.

The roll angle is easily computed,

(25.43)

and the geometrical limitation

φ = arctan

Figure 25.11 usually does not induce further limitations.

Remark 25.4 Since motorcycles roll into the curve, the lateral forces due to camber
add to those due to sideslip, instead of subtracting as in the case of motor vehicles
that roll towards the outside of the curve.

25.2 Ideal Steering

331

Further terms must be introduced into the relevant equations if gyroscopic
moments of the wheels are considered . When the vehicle runs on a circular path with
radius R, the gyroscopic moment, due to the ith wheel with radius Ri and moment
of inertia Jpi about its spin axis, is equal to

Jpi V 2 cos(φ)

.

The added term in Eq. (25.45) is positive and thus the roll angle needed to manage

a certain bend at a certain speed is increased by gyroscopic moments.

Remark 25.5 Generally speaking, the effect of the gyroscopic moment of the wheels
on the dynamic behavior of the whole vehicle is small even in the case of vehicles
with two wheels. Gyroscopic moments are usually important only in the dynamics
of the steering device.

25.3 High Speed Cornering: Simpliﬁed Approach

To go beyond the extremely simpliﬁed model of ideal steering, the distribution of
cornering forces between the axles, the sideslip angle of the vehicle on the path and
the sideslip angles of the wheels must be taken into account.

Assume that the vehicle is moving at constant speed on a circular path and that
the road is level. Moreover, assume that the radius of the path R is much larger than
the wheelbase l and, as a consequence, all sideslip angles are small. The small size
of all angles allows the “monotrack” or “bicycle” model to be used.

Neglecting aerodynamic forces and aligning torques, the forces acting in the x y

plane at the tire-road interface in a monotrack vehicle are shown in Fig. 25.12.

The equilibrium equation in the direction of the y axis is similar to Eq. (25.21),

is the so-called understeer coefﬁcient or understeer gradient of the vehicle. The
understeer coefﬁcient is a non-dimensional quantity, and is often expressed in radians.

As already stated, in kinematic conditions

The expression 1 + Kus V 2/gl can be considered as a correction factor giving the
response of the vehicle in dynamic conditions as opposed to kinematic conditions.

From Eq. (25.52) it follows that

The understeer factor can thus be interpreted as the difference between the steering
angles in kinematic and dynamic conditions divided by the centrifugal acceleration
expressed as a multiple of the gravitational acceleration.

Sometimes, instead of the understeer coefﬁcient, a stability factor

is deﬁned.

As a ﬁrst approximation, K and K ∗ may be considered as constant for a given
vehicle and load condition. As will be seen below, however, in many cases their
dependence on speed cannot be neglected for more precise assessments.

It is possible to deﬁne a lateral acceleration gain as the ratio between the lateral

25.4 Deﬁnition of Understeer and Oversteer

If Kus = 0 the value of 1/Rδ is constant and equal to the value characterizing kine-
matic steering; i.e. the response of the vehicle to a steering input is, at any speed,
equal to that in kinematic conditions. This does not mean, however, that the vehicle
is in kinematic conditions, since the value of the sideslip angle β is not equal to its
kinematic value and the values of the sideslip angles of the wheels are not equal to
zero.

A vehicle behaving in this way is said to be neutral-steer (Fig. 25.13a).
If Kus > 0 the value of 1/Rδ decreases with increasing speed. The response of
the vehicle is then smaller than in kinematic conditions and, to maintain a constant
radius of the path, the steering angle must be increased as speed increases.

A vehicle behaving in this way is said to be understeer.

of speed (a) and handling diagram (b) for an oversteer, an understeer and a neutral steer vehicle.
The understeer factor is assumed to be independent of speed

A quantitative measure of the understeering of a vehicle is given by the charac-
teristic speed, deﬁned as the speed at which the steering angle needed to negotiate
a turn is equal to twice the Ackerman angle, i.e. the path curvature gain is equal to
1/2l.

Using the simpliﬁed approach outlined above, the characteristic speed is

the response tends to inﬁnity, i.e., the system develops an unstable behavior.

A vehicle behaving in this way is said to be oversteer, and the speed given by Eq.
(25.63) is called the critical speed. The critical speed of any oversteer vehicle must
be well above the maximum speed it can reach, at least in normal road conditions.
Instead of plotting the path curvature gain as a function of the speed, it is possible
to plot the handling diagram, i.e., the plot of the lateral acceleration ay as a function
of δkin − δ (Fig. 25.13b). If the vehicle is neutral steer, the plot is a vertical straight
line, if it is oversteer it is a straight line sloping to the right, while in case of an
understeer vehicle it slopes to the left.

336

25 Handling Performance

The value of β, or better, of β/δ, decreases with the speed from the kinematic
(cid:22)

value up to the speed

(V )β=0 =

(25.64)

at which it vanishes. At higher speed it becomes negative, tending to inﬁnity when
approaching the critical speed for oversteer vehicles and tending to

aC1
aC1 − bC2

when the speed tends to inﬁnity in the case of understeering vehicles.

The sideslip angles of the front and rear wheels are equal in neutral-steer vehicles.
In oversteer vehicles, the rear wheels have a larger sideslip angle (in absolute value,
since the sideslip angles are negative when the radius of the path is positive), while
the opposite holds in understeer vehicles. It follows that oversteer vehicles can be

a vehicle with a single

25.4 Deﬁnition of Understeer and Oversteer

337

expected to reach limit conditions at the rear wheels and understeer vehicles at the
front wheels, even if the present model cannot be applied when the sideslip angles
increase, approaching limit conditions.

A graphical interpretation of this result, for a vehicle with a single steering axle,
is shown in Fig. 25.14. The vehicle is modelled as a steering front axle and a ﬁxed
rear axle. Kinematic steering applies if the speed tends to zero: the sideslip angles
vanish and the center of path is point O. It follows immediately that

l
R

= tan(δ) ≈ δ .

With increasing speed the wheels work with increasing sideslip angles α1 and α2.
If α1 = α2 angle BO(cid:4)A is still equal to δ (its value is |α2| + δ − |α1|) and thus O(cid:4)
lies on a circle through points A, B and O.

Since l (cid:9) R(cid:4), O(cid:4) is in a position almost opposite to A and B and then R(cid:4) ≈ R.
The radius of the path is still equal to that characterizing kinematic steering, and the
vehicle is neutral steer.

If |α1| > |α2| the center of the path moves to O(cid:4)(cid:4) and radius R(cid:4)(cid:4) is larger than R.
The vehicle is then understeer. If, on the other hand, |α1| < |α2|, the center of the
path is O(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4), radius R(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) is smaller than R(cid:4) and the vehicle is oversteer.

25.5 High Speed Cornering

25.5.1 Equations of Motion

The study of handling seen in the previous sections was based on the assumption of
steady-state operation. Moreover, only the cornering forces acting on the tires were
considered.

A simple mathematical model for the handling behavior of a rigid vehicle that

overcomes the above limitations can, however, be built.

To keep the model as simple as possible, the following assumptions may be made

1. The sideslip angle of the vehicle β and of the wheels α are small. The yaw angular

velocity ˙ψ can also be considered a small quantity.

2. The vehicle can be assumed to be a rigid body moving on a ﬂat surface, i.e.,
roll and pitch angles are neglected as well as the vertical displacements due to
suspensions.

If a motor vehicle is considered as a rigid body moving on a surface, a model
with three degrees of freedom is needed for the study of its motion. If the road is
considered as a ﬂat surface, the motion is planar. By using the inertial reference

338

25 Handling Performance

Fig. 25.15 Reference frame for the study of the motion of a rigid vehicle. The vehicle has three
degrees of freedom, and the coordinates X and Y of the centre of mass G and the yaw angle ψ can
be used as generalized coordinates

frame4 X Y shown in Fig. 25.15, it is possible to use the coordinates X and Y of the
centre of mass G of the vehicle and the yaw angle ψ between the x and X axes as
generalized coordinates.

The equations of motion of the vehicle are

⎧
⎨

⎩

m ¨X = FX
m ¨Y = FY
Jz

¨ψ = Mz ,

(25.65)

where FX , FY and Mz are the total forces acting in the X and Y directions and the
total yawing moment. For the latter, subscript z has been used instead of Z since the
directions of the two axes coincide.

Equations (25.65) are very simple but include the forces acting on the vehicle in
the direction of the axes of the inertial frame. They are clearly linked with the forces
acting in the directions of axes x and y of the vehicle by the obvious relationship

4As already stated, such a reference frame is not, strictly speaking, inertial, since it is ﬁxed to
the road surface and hence follows the motion of Earth. It is, however, inertial “enough” for the
problems here studied, and this issue will not be dealt with any further.

25.5 High Speed Cornering

339

If the model is used to perform a numerical integration in time, they can be used

directly without any difﬁculty.

However, if the model has to be used to obtain linearized equations in order to gain
a general insight into the behavior of the vehicle, it is better to write the equations
of motion with reference to the non-inertial x y frame, to avoid dealing with the
trigonometric functions of angle ψ, which in general is not a small angle, and would
make linearizations impossible.

To write the equations of motion with reference to the body-ﬁxed frame x yz, it is
expedient to use the components u and v of the speed in the directions of the x and
y axes and the yaw angular velocity

There are many ways to obtain the mathematical model, but perhaps the simplest
is to remember that the derivative with respect to time of a generic vector (cid:10)A, expressed
in the body-ﬁxed frame, but performed in the inertial frame

can be expressed starting from the derivative performed in the body ﬁxed frame

as

Velocities u and v are not derivatives of true coordinates, but nevertheless they
can be used to write the equations of motion. They are actually derivatives of pseudo-
coordinates, and the procedure here followed can also be used in cases where the
kinematic equation (25.72) is more complicated, and where, in particular, the equa-
tion contains a matrix AT that does not satisfy the relationship

AT = A−1 .

Equations (25.87) are nonlinear in the velocities u, v and r but, since the sideslip
angle β is small and its trigonometric functions can be linearized, the linearization
of the equations is possible. The components of velocity V can be written as

(cid:4)

u = V cos(β) ≈ V
v = V sin(β) ≈ V β .

(25.88)

Product ˙ψv can be considered the product of two small quantities and it is thus
of the same order as the ﬁrst term ignored in the series for the cosine. It is therefore
cancelled.

The speed V can be considered a known function of time, which amounts to
studying the motion with a given law V (t) (in many cases at constant speed) and
assuming as an unknown the driving or the braking force needed to follow such a
law. The unknown for the degree of freedom related to translation along the x-axis
in this case is the force Fxd exerted by the driving wheels. When braking, force Fxd
is the total braking force exerted by all wheels.

Equations (25.87) reduces to the linear form in Fx , v and r :

m ˙V = Fx
m ( ˙v + r V ) = Fy

⎩

If the interaction between longitudinal and transversal forces due to the tires is
neglected or accounted for in an approximate way, the ﬁrst equation of motion, which
has already been studied in the section dealing with the longitudinal performance of
the vehicle, uncouples from the other two.

This amounts to saying that the lateral behavior is uncoupled from the longitudinal

behavior and can be studied using just two variables, either velocities v and r :

25.5.2 Sideslip Angles of the Wheels

The sideslip angles of the wheels may be expressed easily in terms of the generalized
velocities. With reference to Fig. 25.16, the velocity of the centre Pi of the contact
area of the ith wheel, located in a point whose coordinates are xi and yi in the
reference frame of the vehicle, is

Angle βi between the direction of the velocity of point Pi and x-axis is

the speed V , it follows that

(25.95)

Coordinate yi of the centre of the contact area of the wheel does not appear in the
expression for the sideslip angle αi . If the differences between the steering angles δi
of the wheels of the same axle are neglected, the values of their sideslip angles are
then equal. This allows one to work in terms of axles instead of single wheels and to
substitute a model of the type of Fig. 4.1b to that of Fig. 4.1a. This approach is very
common and is often referred to as the monotrack vehicle or bicycle model.

The explicit expressions of the sideslip angles of the front and rear axles of a

vehicle with two axles are then

(25.96)

In the majority of cases only the front axle can steer and δ2 = 0.

Remark 25.6 The assumption of a rigid vehicle prevents one from considering roll
steering.

25.5.3 Forces Acting on the Vehicle

Normal forces acting on the vehicle in symmetrical conditions were obtained in
Chap. 23. When lateral accelerations are present, the vehicle is not in symmetrical
conditions and the forces on the ground are not equally subdivided between the two
wheels of each axle. However, the assumption of a small sideslip angle β and the
subsequent linearization and uncoupling between lateral and longitudinal behavior
allow one to use the same values of the forces on the ground previously seen. More-
over, to investigate how forces are subdivided between the wheels of the same axle
has little meaning in a monotrack vehicle.

The forces acting in the x y plane at the tire-road interface in a monotrack vehicle

are shown in Fig. 25.12.

346

25 Handling Performance

Since the lateral behavior is uncoupled from the longitudinal one, only the resul-

tants of the side force Fy and of the yaw moment Mz need to be computed:

where xi and yi are the coordinates of the center of the contact zone, Mzi represents
the aligning moments of the wheels and Mze is a yawing moment applied to the
vehicle. Subscript i indicates the axle, and thus if the vehicle has two axles i = 1, 2.
If the rear axle does not steer, δ2 = 0.
Cornering Forces

Owing to linearization, equation (25.97) reduces to

where products Fxit δi can usually be neglected, since they are far smaller than the
other forces included in the equation.

Since the model has been linearized, cornering forces can be expressed as the

product of the cornering stiffness by the sideslip angle

Fyi

= −Ci αi = −Ci

(
β + xi
V

)

r − δi

.

(25.100)

Equation (25.100) is written in terms of axles. The cornering stiffness is then that
of the axle and not of the single wheel. In this way no allowance is taken for the
camber force as, owing to the assumption of a rigid vehicle, no roll is considered
and the wheels of a given axle have opposite camber. The camber forces then cancel
each other.

Nor is allowance made for toe-in and transversal load transfer. If the dependence
of the cornering stiffness were linear with the load Fz, this would be correct since the
increase of cornering stiffness of the more loaded wheel would exactly compensate
for the decrease of the other wheel. As this is not exactly the case, the load transfer
causes a decrease of the cornering stiffness of each axle, but this effect is usually
considered negligible, at least for lateral accelerations lower than 0.5 g.6 Toe-in

it is negative.

By linearizing also the value of the aerodynamic coefﬁcient C y

and assuming that the steering angles of the various axles can be expressed as

δi = K (cid:4)

(25.101)

Yr and Yδ are the derivatives of the force with respect to the three variables β, r and
δ and may be obtained in any way, even experimentally, if possible.

In the case of vehicles with only one steering axle, all K (cid:4)

while in other cases they can be functions of many parameters. If the variables of

The ﬁrst Eq. (25.98) has been obtained conﬂating the sideslip angle of the vehicle

348

25 Handling Performance

The same considerations seen for the cornering force hold here; moreover, the
aligning torque is far less important and the errors in its evaluation affect the global
behavior of the vehicle far less than errors in the cornering force. In the following
equations the values of (Mz),α are referred to the whole axle.

Acting similarly to that seen for the cornering forces, the linearized expression

for the yawing moments is

25.5.4 Derivatives of Stability

As already stated, the terms Yβ, Yr , Yδ, Nβ, Nr and Nδ are nothing but the derivatives
∂ Fy/∂β, ∂ Fy/∂r , etc. They are usually referred to as derivatives of stability. Nr is
sometimes referred to as yaw damping, as it is a factor that, multiplied by an angular
velocity, yields a moment, like a damping coefﬁcient.

In a simpliﬁed study of the handling of road vehicles, aerodynamic forces are
usually neglected, as is the interaction between the longitudinal and transversal forces
of the tires. In these conditions, Yβ, Yδ, Nβ and Nδ are constant while Yr and Nr are
proportional to 1/V . Note that they are strongly inﬂuenced by the load and road
conditions through the cornering stiffness of the tires.

If aerodynamic forces are considered, the airspeed Vr is often substituted by the
groundspeed V . These forces introduce a strong dependence with V 2 in Yβ and Nβ
and with V in Nr .

Example 25.3 Compute the derivatives of stability at 100 km/h of the vehicle of
Appendix E.2, using the simpliﬁed and the complete formulations. Plot the deriva-
tives of stability as functions of the speed for the same vehicle. In the whole compu-
tation neglect the longitudinal forces on the tires.

The normal forces on the ground are ﬁrst computed. At 100 km/h, at constant
velocity on level road, they are 4.804 and 3.536 kN for the front and rear axles
respectively.

25.5 High Speed Cornering

349

From these values the cornering and aligning stiffness can be computed as C1 =
),α = 1,366

),α = 2,010 Nm/rad and (Mz2

67,369 N/rad, C2 = 63,411 N/rad, (Mz1
Nm/rad.

These values refer to the axles; the normal load on each wheel must be ﬁrst
computed and introduced into the “magic formula”; the results are then multiplied
by the number of wheels on the axles.

By taking into account only the cornering forces of the tires, the following values

of the derivatives of stability at 100 km/h are obtained:

Yβ (N/rad) Yr (Ns/rad) Yδ (N/rad) Nβ (Nm/rad) Yr (Nms/rad) Yδ (Nm/rad)
−130,570

−5,622

824.62

58,615

67,374

22,906

If the complete expressions, including aligning torques, aerodynamic forces and
load shift between the wheels of the same axle are used, the values of the derivatives
of stability at 100 km/h are:

Yβ (N/rad) Yr (Ns/rad) Yδ (N/rad) Nβ (Nm/rad) Yr (Nms/rad) Yδ (Nm/rad)
−132,340

−5,630

55,962

26,488

824.62

67,374

The derivatives of stability are plotted as functions of the speed in Fig. 25.17. The
values obtained from the complete expressions are reported as full lines while the
dashed lines are the constant values (proportional to 1/V for Yr and Nr ) obtained
when considering the cornering forces only, computed at 100 km/h.

Note that Nβ is the only derivative of stability strongly affected by load shift,
aligning torques and the other effects. Here an apparently strange result is obtained:
From the formula a decrease in Nβ seems to occur with increasing speed, as the
aerodynamic term is negative, while the plot shows an increase.

The latter is due to the longitudinal load shift which, while causing an increase of
the load on the rear axle, produces an increase of Nβ that is larger than the decrease
due to the aerodynamic moment Mz.

25.5.5 Final Expression of the Equations of Motion

The ﬁnal expression of the linearized equations of motion for the handling model is
thus

(cid:4)

(cid:13)

(cid:12)

˙β + r

mV
Jz ˙r = Nββ + Nrr + Nδδ + Mze .

+ m ˙V β = Yββ + Yr r + Yδδ + Fye

(25.108)

These are two ﬁrst order differential equations for the two unknown β and r .
These equations are apparently ﬁrst order equations: the variables β and r are
actually an angular velocity (r ) or a quantity linked with a velocity (β was introduced
instead of velocity v); their derivatives are thus accelerations. The missing term is
therefore not the second derivative (acceleration), but the displacement.

Alternatively, a set of two ﬁrst order differential equations in v and r could be

written.

The steering angle δ can be considered as an input to the system, together with
the external force and moment Fye and Mze . This approach is usually referred to as
the “locked controls” behavior.

Alternatively, it is possible to study the “free controls” behavior, in which the
steering angle δ is one of the variables of the motion and a further equation expressing
the dynamics of the steering system is added.

In the ﬁrst case, β and r can be considered as state variables and Eq. (25.108) can

be written directly as a state equation

˙z = Az + Bcuc + Beue ,

The block diagram corresponding to the state equation is shown in Fig. 25.18.
The study of the system is straightforward: The eigenvalues of the dynamic matrix
allow one to see immediately whether the behavior is stable or not, and the study
of the solution to given constant inputs yields the steady state response to a steering
input or to external forces and moments.

There is, however, an interesting analogy. If the speed is kept constant in such
a way that the derivatives of stability are constant in time, there is no difﬁculty in
obtaining r from the ﬁrst Eq. (25.108) and substituting it into the second, which
becomes a second order differential equation in β. Similarly, solving the second in
β and substituting it in the ﬁrst one, an equation in r is obtained. The result is

The equations are formally identical to the equation of motion of a spring-mass-

The linearized behavior of a rigid motor vehicle at constant speed is thus identical
to that of a mass P suspended from a spring with stiffness U and a damper with
damping coefﬁcient Q, excited by the different forcing functions stated above (the
command δ and the external disturbances).

Remark 25.7 The analogy here suggested is only a formal one: as already stated,
the state variables β and r are dimensionally an angular velocity (r ) or are related to
velocities (β has been introduced to express the lateral velocity v) and not displace-
ments, and thus P, Q and U are dimensionally far from being a mass, a damping
coefﬁcient and a stiffness.

25.6 Steady-State Lateral Behavior

In steady state driving the radius of the path is constant, i.e. the path is circular. The
relationship linking the angular velocity r to the radius R of the path is thus

If a simpliﬁed expression of the derivatives of stability, including only the corner-
ing forces of the tires, is introduced in the above expressions, the same values of the
gains reported in equations from (25.53) to (25.61) are obtained.

When the dependence of the derivatives of stability on the speed is accounted for,
the law 1/Rδ as a function of V is no more monotonic as those shown in Fig. 25.13a
and the behavior may change from understeer to oversteer (or viceversa).
The aerodynamic yawing moment produces a strong effect. If ∂C Mz

/∂β is neg-
ative (the side force Fy acts forward of the centre of mass), the effect is increasing
oversteer or decreasing understeer, at increasing speed. If a critical speed exists, such
an aerodynamic effect lowers it and has an overall destabilizing effect, increasing
with the absolute value of (C Mz

),β. The opposite occurs if (C Mz

),β is positive.

of speed (a) and handling diagram (b) for a vehicle that at low speed is oversteer and then becomes
understeer at high speed

The longitudinal load shift produces another important effect. If the load on the
rear axle increases more, or decreases less, than that on the front axle, the understeer
increases with increasing speed.

The case of a vehicle that is oversteer at low speed and understeer at high speed,
),β, is shown in Fig. 25.20. Following
as can be caused by a positive value of (C Mz
the deﬁnition seen above, the speed at which neutral-steer is obtained is identiﬁed
by point B.

If the simpliﬁed expressions for the derivatives of stability are not used, a new def-
inition of a neutral-steer, and hence under- and oversteer, vehicle may be introduced.

On the plot of Fig. 25.20 the speed at which neutral-steering is obtained is point

A, where the curve reaches its maximum.

Remark 25.8 In case the derivatives of stability are constant (Yr and Nr are propor-
tional to 1/V ) the ﬁrst deﬁnition, which can be said to be absolute and the second,
which can be said to be incremental, coincide.

25.6 Steady-State Lateral Behavior

355

Remark 25.9 The incremental deﬁnition corresponds to the sensations of the driver,
who perceives the vehicle as oversteering if an increase of speed is accompanied by a
decrease in radius of the path and vice versa. The driver clearly has no way of sensing
the kinematic value of the radius of the path and hence the absolute deﬁnition has
little meaning for him. From the viewpoint of the equations of motion, on the other
hand, the absolute deﬁnition is more signiﬁcant.

The generalized deﬁnition (25.57) of the understeer factor

Kus = g
ay

(δ − δkin) ,

and the corresponding deﬁnition of the stability factor holds in the present case as
well. They are essentially the difference between the steering angle needed to keep
the vehicle on a given trajectory in dynamic conditions and that corresponding to
kinematic steering, multiplied by a suitable factor proportional to 1/V 2.

Generally speaking, they depend on the speed and on other conditions, such as

(25.119)

In this case the point in which the understeer factor vanishes and the vehicle is

neutral steer is point A in Fig. 25.20b instead of being point B.

25.7 Neutral-Steer Point and Static Margin

The neutral-steer point of the vehicle is usually deﬁned as the point on the plane of
symmetry to which is applied the resultant of the cornering forces due to the tires as
a consequence of a sideslip angle β, obviously with δ = 0 and r = 0. The cornering
forces under these conditions, computed through the linearized model, are simply
−C1β and −C2β and the x coordinate of the neutral point is

x N = aC1 − bC2
C1 + C2

.

(25.120)

A better deﬁnition of neutral-steer point may, however, be introduced. If all forces
and moments due to a sideslip angle β, with δ = 0 and r = 0 are considered, the
resultant force and moment are simply Yββ and Nββ respectively.7 The x coordinate
of the neutral-steer point, deﬁned as the point of application of the resultant of all
lateral forces is thus

7Yβ may be considered as a sort of cornering stiffness of the vehicle.

(25.122)

An external force applied to the neutral-steer point does not cause any steady-state
yaw velocity, as will be seen when dealing with the response to external forces and
moments. Owing to the mathematical model used in the present chapter, the height
of the neutral-steer point cannot be deﬁned.

Note that to obtain a neutral-steer response, the neutral-steer point must coincide

with the centre of mass, i.e.

x N = 0 , Ms = 0 , Nβ = 0 .

If they are positive the vehicle is oversteer8 (centre of gravity behind the neutral

point); the opposite applies to understeer vehicles.

The signs of parameters K , K ∗, Ms, x N , |α1| − |α2| and Nβ corresponding to

oversteer, understeer or neutral-steer behavior are reported in Table 25.1.

Since Nβ = 0 in case of neutral-steer, the second equation of motion (25.108)

uncouples from the ﬁrst and simpliﬁes as

Jz ˙r = Nr r + Nδδ + Mze

.

(25.123)

The behavior of a neutral-steer motor vehicle is thus that of a ﬁrst order system

rather than a second order system.

Example 25.4 Study the directional behavior of the vehicle of Appendix E.2, using
the simpliﬁed and the complete formulations.

The value of Nβ is positive and hence the vehicle is understeer. Using the values
of the derivatives of stability computed from the cornering stiffness at 100 km/h,
the values of the coordinate of the neutral-steer point and of the static margin are

8Sometimes the position of the neutral-steer point and the static margin are deﬁned with different
sign conventions: Instead of referring to the position of the neutral-steer point with respect to the
centre of mass, the position of the latter with respect to the former is given. In this case the signs of
x N and Ms are changed and an understeer vehicle has a positive static margin.

25.7 Neutral-Steer Point and Static Margin

357

x N = −175 mm, Ms = −0.081, while the values obtained, always at 100 km/h,
using a complete expression of the derivatives of stability are x N = −200 mm, Ms =
−0.093.

The path curvature gain, the lateral acceleration gain, the sideslip angle gain and
the yaw velocity gain are plotted as functions of the speed in Fig. 25.21. The values
obtained from the complete expressions of the derivatives of stability are shown as
full lines, while the dashed lines refer to the simpliﬁed expressions for the derivatives
of stability (constant or proportional to 1/V for Yr and Nr ) obtained by considering
only the cornering forces computed at 100 km/h. The dotted lines refer to a neutral-
steer vehicle.

The vehicle has a strong understeer behavior, even more so if the complete expres-
sion of the derivatives of stability is considered. However, the simpliﬁed approach
allows one to obtain a fair approximation of the directional behavior of the vehicle.

If the vehicle is neutral-steer, Nβ = 0 and consequently

1
R Fye

= 0 .

In neutral steer vehicles, then, the path remains straight under the effect of an
external force (Fig. 25.22Ia). This may be easily understood considering that the
neutral-steer point lies in the centre of mass, i.e. in the point of application of the
external force.

Actually, this condition can be used to deﬁne the neutral-steer point as the point
in which the application of an external force does not cause a yaw rotation of the
vehicle. If the presence of the suspension is accounted for, it is possible to deﬁne,
instead of a neutral-steer point, a neutral-steer line as the locus of the points in the x z
plane in which an external force applied in the y direction does not cause any yaw
rotation.

The path is, however, changed from the one preceding the application of force
/Yβ. The lateral velocity of the

.

Remark 25.10 It is very important that Yβ be as large as possible in order to avoid
large lateral velocities, particularly in the case of fast vehicles.

If the vehicle is understeer, the neutral-steer point is behind the centre of mass
and the path bends as in Fig. 25.22Ib. The opposite effect can be found in the case of
oversteer vehicles. Note that the trajectories so computed are steady-state trajectories,
and when the force is applied an unstationary motion occurs (dashed lines in the
ﬁgure). This ﬁrst part of the path cannot be computed with the above mentioned
equations.

and (c) oversteer vehicle. II. Response to a lateral wind; point of application of the side force in the
neutral-steer point (a), forward (b) and after the neutral-steer point (c) and (d)

All the gains expressed by Eq. (25.124) tend to inﬁnity when approaching the
critical speed if the vehicle is oversteer, while they decrease with the speed in case
of understeer vehicles.

The effect of a crosswind may be considered as the combined effect of a force
and a moment. If the relative velocity is changed by angle ψw with respect to the
velocity in still air, the force and the moment acting on the vehicle due to crosswind
are

Fyw

= (Fyaer

),βψw ,

Mzw

= (Mzaer

),βψw .

(25.125)

Note that this approach, essentially a linearization of aerodynamic forces, holds
only for small values of ψw, or, better, for values causing angle β + ψw to remain
within the range where the side force and the yawing moment can be linearized. This
occurs either for feeble crosswinds or for head- or tailwinds. If the wind velocity is
not small, the aerodynamic terms of the derivatives of stability must be computed
using Vr instead of V .

The response in terms of curvature of the path, computed as the sum of the response

to a force and to a moment, is

The trajectories are shown in Fig. 25.22II.
Usually the point of application of the aerodynamic force is in front of both the
centre of mass and the neutral-steer point. In this case the path bends downwind
(curve b).

The path bends upwind (curves c and d) on the other hand, if the point of appli-
cation of aerodynamic forces is behind the neutral-steer point . If this effect is not
too strong (curve d3), it is beneﬁcial since very little correction is needed, but if the
result resembles that of curve d1, a large correction may be required in a direction
opposite to the instinctive reaction of the driver.

Remark 25.11 It must be noted again that the present steady-state model has limited
application in the case of wind gusts, which involve primarily unsteady phenomena.

The application of a side force to the centre of mass is easy: It is sufﬁcient to
use a road with a transversal slope fashioned in a proper way. Wind gusts may be
simulated using jet engines and suitable ducts to distribute the gust with the required
proﬁle.

25.9 Slip Steering

As stated in Chap. 20, the trajectory of a vehicle on pneumatic tires may be controlled
by applying differential longitudinal forces to the tires on the right and left side instead
of steering some of the wheels. This method of driving a vehicle is usually referred
to as slip steering: While it is the usual strategy for controlling tracked vehicles, it
is used as a primary strategy for wheeled vehicles only on some light construction
machines. In the automotive ﬁeld, however, it is increasingly used as an additional
control in connection with VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) systems (see Chap. 27).
Consider the mathematical model of the vehicle expressed by Eqs. (25.108), and

add a control yawing torque Mzc to the second equation

If the two wheels of the ith axle, whose track is ti , produce a longitudinal force

where subscripts L and R designate the left and right wheel, the control torque is

If the longitudinal slip σ of the tires is small enough, the longitudinal force is
proportional to the slip through the slip stiffness Cσ (see Sect. 2.6). Assuming that
the differential longitudinal slip (cid:4)σ is the same on all axles, the yawing moment can

25 Handling Performance

Remark 25.13 The formulae above are based on the assumption that the radius of
the trajectory is much larger than the wheelbase: They do not hold when slip steering
is used for very sharp turns, or even for turning on the spot.

Remark 25.14 Even when the speed tends to zero no kinematic conditions exist: By
deﬁnition slip steering implies that the wheels operate with both longitudinal and
side slip.

25.10 Inﬂuence of Longitudinal Forces on Handling

A vehicle’s directional behavior is strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of longitudinal
forces between tires and road. Any longitudinal force causes a reduction of cornering
stiffness: If applied to the front axle, it reduces the value of C1 and consequently
makes the vehicle more understeer or less oversteer. The opposite effect is caused
by a longitudinal force applied to the rear axle.

In the linearized model this can be easily accounted for by using the ellipti-
cal approximation which, if a complete linearization of the behavior of the tires is
assumed, can be applied directly to each axle

(cid:14)

2

.

Fxi
μ p Fzi

(25.136)

Note that the forces and the cornering stiffness refer to the whole axle.
The driving force needed to maintain a constant speed increases with the latter and,
as a consequence, the cornering stiffness of the tires of the driving axle decreases.
The effect is felt particularly if road conditions are poor, since in Eq. (25.136) the
ratio between the actual and the maximum value of the driving force is present.

The variation of static margin for a front-wheel and a rear-wheel drive saloon
car with the speed due to the effect of the driving forces is shown in Fig. 25.23. It
is clear that the effect is minor in the whole practical speed range of the car if the
road conditions are good while, if μ p is low, the change in handling of the car due
to traction is quite strong.

In the case of rear-wheel drive vehicles, driving forces increase oversteer or
decrease understeer. The critical speed, if it exists, decreases or a critical speed
may appear. In bad road conditions, a rear-wheel drive vehicle may have a very low
critical speed and the driver may be required to limit the speed for stability reasons,
to avoid spinout. Starting and accelerating the vehicle may be difﬁcult and the driver
has to exert great care in operating the accelerator control; antispin or TCS devices
are very useful in these conditions.

Front-wheel drive vehicles, on the other hand, have a tendency toward under-
steering and become more stable with increasing speed or decreasing μ p and an
increasingly large steering angle is needed to maintain the vehicle on a given path.

25.10 Inﬂuence of Longitudinal Forces on Handling

Fig. 25.23 Variation of the
stability margin due to the
longitudinal forces on the
tires in the cases of front-
and rear-wheel drive saloon
cars. Various values of μ p; a
completely linearized model
has been used

The limit condition is that of an inﬁnitely stable vehicle, i.e., a vehicle that can only
move on a straight line.

In vehicles with more than one driving axle, and when braking, handling depends
upon how the longitudinal forces are distributed between the axles. If the front axle
is working with a larger longitudinal force coefﬁcient μx than the rear axle, which
does not necessarily imply that force Fx is larger but that the ratio Fx /Fz of the front
wheels is larger than that of the rear wheels, the vehicle becomes more understeering
and is, in a sense, more stable. When the limit conditions are reached and the front
wheels slip (lock in braking or spin in traction) the vehicle cannot be steered and
follows a straight path.

A larger ratio Fx /Fz at the rear wheels makes the vehicle more oversteer and read-
ily introduces a critical speed. When reaching limit conditions a spinout occurs, unless
the driver promptly reduces the longitudinal forces and countersteers, a manoeuvre
that can be expected only from very proﬁcient drivers. To avoid this situation the
braking system must be such that the working point on the Fx1, Fx2 plane is not found
above the curve for ideal braking. Antispin and antilock devices are very important
from this viewpoint.

When all values of μx are equal, the behavior should theoretically not be affected
by the longitudinal forces; however, when limit conditions occur, the vehicle can
spin out or go straight depending on small changes in many parameters, such as the
conditions of the individual wheels and brakes, the load transfer, etc.

Example 25.5 Study the directional behavior of the vehicle of Appendix E.2, taking
into account the reduction of the cornering stiffness of the driving wheels caused by
the longitudinal forces needed to move at constant speed. Repeat the computation
for two values of μ p, namely 1 and 0.2.

364

25 Handling Performance

The study is performed by computing, at each speed, the values of the longitudinal
and normal component of the tire forces, using the “magic formula” for the cornering
stiffness and then reducing it through the elliptic expression (25.136).

The results, in terms of path curvature gain, lateral acceleration gain, sideslip

for both values of the maximum longitudinal force coefﬁcient. The dashed lines refer
to the simpliﬁed expressions for the derivatives of stability (constant or proportional
to 1/V for Yr and Nr ) obtained considering only the cornering forces computed at
100 km/h; the dotted lines refer to a neutral-steer vehicle.

By comparing Fig. 25.24 with Fig. 25.21, it is clear that the effect of the driving
force is almost negligible throughout the entire speed range if the road conditions
are good (μ p = 1): The lines of the two ﬁgures are almost completely superimposed.

However, if μ p is lowered to 0.2, the understeer behavior becomes much more
marked, particularly at high speed.

25.11 Transversal Load Shift

No allowance has yet been taken for the transversal load shift. If the dependence on
the load of the cornering stiffness of a single wheel is of the type shown in Fig. 25.25,
this does not introduce errors if the load transfer (cid:4)Fz is small, lower than ((cid:4)Fz)lim
in the ﬁgure (condition a).

But if the load shift is larger, as in the case of (cid:4)Fzb, the increase in stiffness of
the more loaded wheel cannot compensate for the decrease in the other wheel and
the cornering stiffness of the axle is reduced. This effect introduces a nonlinearity in
the behavior of the vehicle.

The simultaneous presence of longitudinal forces and load transfer makes things
more complicated. Even if the cornering stiffness is still in the linear part of the plot
of Fig. 25.25, i.e., the load transfer is smaller than ((cid:4)Fz)lim, the combined effect
yields a nonlinear behavior. Assuming that the longitudinal force splits equally on
its two wheels, the cornering stiffness of the axle, computed using the elliptical
approximation, is

Owing to the presence of the square root, the decrease in cornering stiffness of the
less loaded wheel is greater, particularly if μx is low, than the increase at the other
wheel.

Load transfer on the driving axle thus increases the effect of longitudinal forces;
this combined action can be reduced by introducing an anti-roll bar on the other
axle. Operating in this way, the increased load transfer on the non-driving axle also
reduces its cornering stiffness, reducing the overall effect of longitudinal forces on
handling.

Anti-roll bars affect the distribution of transversal load shift between the axles,
increasing the load shift on the relevant one while decreasing that on the other axles.
They can be used to correct the behavior of the vehicle, particularly in conditions
approaching the limit lateral acceleration, as their effect on the cornering stiffness
increases when the latter increases.

Remark 25.15 A large rear-wheel drive saloon car can beneﬁt from the application
of an anti-roll bar at the front axle to correct the strong oversteering tendency when
the rear wheels approach their traction limit, while a small front wheel car can use
an anti-roll bar at the rear axle to reduce its understeering behavior.

It is impossible to state the effect of anti-roll bars on the gains deﬁned in the
previous sections since they introduce a strong nonlinearity into the mathematical
model of the vehicle and the very deﬁnition of the gains is based on a complete
linearization. It is only possible to study a number of speciﬁc cases where the lateral
acceleration is deﬁned, and to compute the response of the vehicle in such conditions.

25.12 Toe-In

Consider an axle (e.g., the front axle), in which the midplanes of the wheels are not
exactly parallel and assume that the x-axes of the reference frames of the wheels
converge in a point lying forward with respect to the axle.9

Let αc be the angle each wheel makes with the symmetry plane of the vehicle,
positive when the toe-in is positive. With reference to Fig. 4.1, the steering angle of

9Toe-in is usually deﬁned as the difference between the distance of the front part and the rear part of
the wheels of an axle, measured at the height of the hub, when the steering is in its central position.
It is positive when the midplanes converge forward.

25.12 Toe-In

367

the wheel on the right side of the vehicle is increased by an angle equal to αc, while
the steering angle of the wheel on the left side is decreased by the same quantity.

If the usual linearization assumptions are accepted, the sideslip angles of the two

wheels of the axle are then

where subscripts r and l refer to the right and left wheels respectively and i refers to
the ith axle.

Consider a vehicle negotiating a bend to the left; the sideslip angle αi is negative
while the side force is positive. The transversal load shift causes an increase of the
load on the wheels on the right, the sideslip angle αi is negative and the side force is
positive.

If transversal load shift is not taken into account, and the two wheels have the same
cornering stiffness, toe-in has no effect within the validity of the linearized model.
The situation is different if load shift is included into the model: then toe-in causes
an increase of the cornering force due to the axle. This has the effect of increasing
the cornering stiffness of the axle, depending on the load shift. Toe-in at the front
wheels or toe-out of the rear ones thus has an oversteer effect.

The effect of toe-in is complicated since αc depends on the steering angle due
to steering error, on suspension geometry and on the relative roll stiffness of the
suspensions that affect the total shift of the various axles.

25.13 Effect of the Elasto-Kinematic Behavior of

Suspensions and of the Compliance of the Chassis

In the present chapter the vehicle is modelled as a rigid body moving on a plane.
Suspensions, apart from causing inertial effects that cannot be studied using the
present model, also change all working angles of the tires and thus affect the forces
acting on the vehicle. The effects introduced by the elasto-kinematic characteristics
of suspensions may be of two different types: some of these effects may be studied

368

25 Handling Performance

using linearized models, at least for small motion about a nominal conﬁguration,
while others must be studied by considering their nonlinear effects, even for small
displacements

An example of the ﬁrst type is roll steer. The characteristics δ(φ) can be linearized,

and a steering angle

(δ),φ φ

can easily be added to the steering angle of the various wheels, or the various axles
in monotrack models.

When, on the contrary, the compliance of the suspensions is accounted for, the
characteristic angles of the wheels depend in a nonlinear way on the variables of
motion and the resulting effects are nonlinear. No general results can thus be obtained
and numerical simulation must be used.

Even if it is possible to remain within linearity limits, the mathematical models
seen in this chapter are too simpliﬁed to depict how the elasto-kinematic charac-
teristics of the suspensions affect the behavior of the vehicle. Some more complex
models taking suspensions into account will be seen in Part V.

Similar considerations also hold for the compliance of the chassis or the body.
In this case, the displacements due to compliance are usually considered small and
the models describing their ﬂexibility are linearized. However, although linear, these
models are complex owing to the large number of deformation degrees of freedom
involved, together with the rigid body degrees of freedom typical of the rigid-body
models. Some models of this kind will be studied in Part V.

In general, we can say that the compliance of the chassis in its plane has little
inﬂuence on the handling of the vehicle. On the other handy, its torsional deformations
can strongly affect handling and lateral behavior.

25.14 Stability of the Vehicle

It is customary to deﬁne a static and a dynamic stability. A system is statically
stable in a given equilibrium condition if, when its state is perturbed, it tends to
return to the previous situation. If the motion following this tendency towards the
previous state of equilibrium succeeds, at least asymptotically, at restoring it, then
the system is dynamically stable. This motion can tend to the equilibrium condition
monotonically or through a damped oscillation. If, on the contrary, the equilibrium
conditions are not reached, usually because a divergent oscillation takes place, the
system is dynamically unstable. If an undamped oscillation occurs, as in the case of
an undamped spring-mass system, the dynamic stability is neutral.

Remark 25.16 If the system is linear, such deﬁnitions hold in the entire range in
which the state variables are deﬁned. If, on the contrary, the system is nonlinear, this
deﬁnition holds “in the small”, i.e. for small variations of the state variables about

25.14 Stability of the Vehicle

369

the values corresponding to an equilibrium point in the state space. The linearized
model here studied is then a linearization suitable for the stability “in the small”.

The deﬁnition of stability above refers to the state of the system; in the case of
the handling model with two degrees of freedom the state variables are β and r (or
v and r ). A motor vehicle is thus stable if, when in motion with given values β0 and
r0 of β and r , after a small external perturbation, it follows that

β(t) → β0 ,

r (t) → r0 .

No reference is made to the path: After a perturbation the vehicle cannot return to
the previous path, and a correction by the driver or by an automatic control system
is required in order to maintain the vehicle on the road.

25.14.1 Locked Controls

If the steering wheel is kept in a position that allows the vehicle to maintain the
required path, the stability can be studied simply by using the homogeneous equation
of motion

˙z = Az .

The eigenvalues of the dynamic matrix A are readily found and the stability is
assessed from the sign of their real part, which must be negative. If the imaginary
part is nonzero the behavior is oscillatory, which does not necessarily imply that the
path is oscillatory but only that the time histories β(t) and r (t) are.

The analogy with the spring-mass-damper system allows a simpler approach to

the study of the stability at constant speed.

Assuming a solution of the type

β(t) = β0est ,

r (t) = r0est ,

the characteristic equation yielding the poles of the system is

Ps2 + Qs + U = 0 .

(25.141)

Since P, Q and U depend in general on the speed V , it is possible to compute the
roots locus at various speed. By using the simpliﬁed expression for the derivatives
of stability, the characteristic equation reduces to

(cid:31)

370

25 Handling Performance

At any rate, the analogy allows us to state that

• to ensure static stability the stiffness U must be positive,
• to ensure dynamic stability the damping coefﬁcient Q must be positive,
• if Q is lower than the critical damping 2

√

PU the system has an oscillatory

behavior.

Using the simpliﬁed expression of the derivatives of stability, the following expres-

sion of the “stiffness” U can be readily obtained,

U = C1C2l 2

V

(1 + K V 2) ,

(25.143)

where K is the stability factor deﬁned by Eq. (25.58).

U is thus always positive for understeer and neutral-steer vehicles, and in the
latter case it tends to zero when the speed tends to inﬁnity. In the case of oversteer
vehicles, it is positive up to the critical speed, where it vanishes to become negative
at higher speed. The critical speed is thus the threshold of instability for oversteer
vehicles. Similar results are obtained if the complete expressions for the derivatives
of stability are used.

It is also easy to verify that Q is always positive: If the vehicle is statically stable it
is also dynamically stable. If the simpliﬁed expression for the derivatives of stability
is accepted, the value of Q is independent of the speed

Q = Jz(C1 + C2) + m(a2C1 + b2C2) .

(25.144)

The critical damping of the equivalent system Qcrit is, under the same simplifying

assumptions,

√

(cid:11)

Qcrit = 2

PU = 2

C1C2 Jzml 2(1 + K V 2) .

(25.145)

It is a constant in the case of neutral-steer vehicles, increases with speed for
understeer vehicles, and decreases, vanishing at the critical speed, in case of oversteer
ones.

By comparing the actual with the critical damping, it follows that understeer vehi-
cles tend to develop an oscillatory behavior with a frequency which increases with the
speed (similar to a spring-mass-damper system with constant damping and increas-
ing stiffness). Oversteer vehicles, on the other hand, tend to return to the original
state without oscillations, but in a way that slows with increasing speed, similar to a
spring-mass-damper system with constant damping and decreasing stiffness.

In a neutral-steer vehicle, under the same assumptions seen above, when K = 0

and

C1a = C2b ,

Thus it is clear that the damping coefﬁcient Q has its critical value with an error
as small as a term in (cid:14)2. A neutral-steer vehicle is then critically damped, at least
in an approximate way, while understeer and oversteer vehicles are, respectively,
underdamped and overdamped: The free behavior of the former can then be expected
to be oscillatory. It must be noted, however, that the issue of whether a given vehicle
has an oscillatory behavior or not cannot be satisfactorily resolved using the present
rigid-body model since the presence of rolling motions, which are neglected here and
are almost always underdamped and thus oscillatory, can also induce an oscillatory
behavior for β and r . This is particularly true for vehicles whose suspensions exhibit
roll steer.

Example 25.6 Study the stability with locked controls of the vehicle of Appendix
E.2, taking into account the reduction of the cornering stiffness of the driving wheels
caused by the longitudinal forces needed to move at constant speed.

The parameters of the equivalent spring-mass-damper system are evaluated ﬁrst
and then the poles of the system are computed. The values obtained at 100 km/h
(27.78 m/s) are reported in Table 25.2.

It is clear that the effect of driving forces on stability at 100 km/h is not great,
even if the available traction is quite low, and that the simpliﬁed formulae already
yield satisfactory results.

The values of P, Q and U are reported, together with that of Qcrit , as functions
of the speed in Fig. 25.26a. In the same ﬁgure, the real and imaginary parts of s
and the roots locus are also shown. The ﬁgure has been obtained using the complete
expressions of the derivatives of stability, but neglecting the effect of driving forces.
Note that the stiffness U reduces with speed without tending to zero as in the case
of neutral vehicles, and that the vehicle is almost always underdamped, except for
very low speed, when Q > Qcrit .

25.14.2 Free Controls

If the steering wheel is not controlled, motion of the vehicle with free controls
occurs. The steering angle δ then becomes not an input to the system but one of its
state variables, and a new equation stating the equilibrium of the steering system has
to be included.

The same approach could be followed in the study of motion with locked controls,
since what is locked is actually not the steering angle δ but the position of the steering
wheel and, if the compliance of the steering system is accounted for, steering angle
and position of the wheel do not coincide.

However, if the compliance of the steering system is considered, oscillatory
motions with high frequency can usually be found, and it is unrealistic to consider
the driver as a device that inputs a position signal δ to the vehicle. It is more correct
to consider the driver as a device supplying a driving torque on the steering wheel.
The motion thus occurs in conditions closer to a free than a locked control situation.
The actual situation is mixed: at low frequencies, such as those typical of the
motion of the vehicle as a whole, the locked control model is adequate, while for
high frequency modes the free control model is more suitable.

At any rate, since the motion of the vehicle includes high frequency components,
the dynamic behavior of the tires cannot be neglected. The simplest way to include
it into a linearized model is to use relationships of the type

The equation that must be added to Eqs. (25.150) states the equilibrium to rotation
of the steering system, assumed to be a rigid system. The geometry of the steering
system is sketched in Fig. 25.27. The wheel rotates about an axis, the kingpin axis,
which is neither perpendicular to the ground nor passing through the centre of the
contact area: The caster angle ν, the lateral inclination angle λ and the longitudinal
and lateral offset at the ground dl and dt are reported in the ﬁgure. In the ﬁgure, the
kingpin axis intersects with the rotation axis of the wheel, a very common situation.
The case in which the two axes are skewed will not be dealt with here.

If the kingpin axis were perpendicular to the ground and no offset were present,
the torque acting on the wheel as a consequence of the road-tire interaction forces
would be the aligning torque alone. The actual situation is different, however, and the
torque about the kingpin axis contains all forces and moments acting on the wheel.

and that of the kingpin), the damping coefﬁcient of the steering damper and the
moment of inertia of the whole system, the latter two reduced to the kingpin. Note
that the steering ratio is often not constant and that the compliance of the mechanism,
here neglected, may have a large effect on it.

No gyroscopic effect of the wheels has been accounted for, which is consistent
with the assumption of a rigid vehicle, even if a weak gyroscopic effect should be
present if the kingpin axis is not perpendicular to the road.

Equation (25.156) holds also when more complicated geometries are accounted
for, provided that a linearization about a reference position is performed. In this case,
the expressions of the derivatives of stability Mβ, Mr etc. also contain the longitudinal

The state equation can be used to study the stability of the vehicle and the response
to any given law Ms(t). In a similar way, it is possible to study the steady-state
performance simply by assuming that all derivatives are vanishingly small (the last
state equation may then be dropped, since it reduces to the identity 0 = 0)

The steering wheel torque gain Ms/δ with reference to the steering angle and that

referring to the curvature of the path Ms R, may be easily computed.

The eigenproblem

det(A − sI) = 0

(25.158)

allows one to study stability. Since the size of the dynamic matrix A is only 4, it
is possible to write the characteristic equation and to solve it using the formula for
4-th degree algebraic equations. However, no closed form solution from which to
draw general conclusions is available. The eigenvalues are either a pair of complex
conjugate solutions—yielding damped oscillations (if both real parts are negative),
one usually at low frequency and the other at high frequency—or two nonoscillatory
solutions and one high frequency oscillation. The high frequency solution is usually
linked with the dynamics of the steering device while the others are linked primarily
to the behavior of the vehicle.

The vibrations of the steering system were of concern in the past, particularly
in the 1930s, when they were referred to as steering shimmy. Such vibrations were
also present in the tailwheel of aircraft undercarriages. The use of tires with lower
pneumatic trail and, above all, the introduction of damping in the steering mechanism
has completely rectiﬁed the problem. Both viscous damping and dry friction have
been used with success, but the latter decreases the reversibility of the steering system
and thus decreases its precision and its centering characteristics.

The, now common, use of servosystems in the steering control implies the presence

of non-negligible damping with viscous characteristics in the steering device.

378

25 Handling Performance

The present model is, however, too imprecise for a detailed study of this phe-
nomenon, since the compliance of the steering system and the lateral compliance of
the suspension are important causal factors in this type of vibration that may become
self-excited.

If only the low-frequency overall behavior of the vehicle is studied, it is possible to
neglect the dependence of the tire forces on the time derivative of the sideslip angle.
In this case, the expressions of the dynamic matrix and of the input gain matrix
simplify as follows:

If the inertia and the damping of the steering system are likewise neglected, Eq.

an approximate model for the behavior of the vehicle with free controls is obtained.

The equation is formally identical to the homogeneous Eq. (25.108) and in this
case as well, it is possible to resort to a spring-mass-damper analogy and to study
the constant speed stability in a simple way. It can be shown that both the stiffness
and the damping coefﬁcient are always positive, denoting both static and dynamic
stability.

25.14 Stability of the Vehicle

By introducing only the cornering forces due to the tires, the vehicle is overdamped

at low speed, up to

.

Above that speed the behavior becomes more and more underdamped, with an

increasingly oscillatory behavior.

Note, however, that the last simpliﬁcation is usually too rough: In most cases,
the high value of the steering ratio τs makes the inertia of the steering wheel when
reduced to the kingpin axis non-negligible and the use of Eq. (25.159) can lead to
non-negligible errors. Other errors may be introduced by neglecting steering damping
since a certain amount of damping is present in the system, the neglect of which may
cause dynamic instability.

Example 25.7 Compute the torque that must be exerted on the steering wheel nec-
essary to maintain the vehicle of Appendix E.2 on a circular path with a radius of
100 m and to counteract a transversal slope of 1◦ at constant speed.

The additional data for the steering system are: λ = 11◦, ν = 3◦, d = 5 mm and

τs = 16.

The steering wheel torque gain Ms R can be computed from Eq. (25.157). By

stating Fye
follows the application of a unit torque to the steering wheel.

Since R = V /r , the gain Ms R may be immediately computed and thus the value
of the torque needed to maintain any given circular path. The results for R = 100 m
are reported in Fig. 25.28a.

25 Handling Performance

To obtain the steering torque needed to counteract a transversal road slope, Eq.

(25.156) needs to be rearranged. The slope αt is felt by the vehicle as a side force

Fye

= mg sin(αt ); .

If the path is straight, r = 0 and also Mze is equal to zero, as no external moment

acts on the vehicle. The unknowns are β, δ and Ms.

25.15 Unstationary Motion

The response to a steering input in unstationary conditions may be computed using
the constant-speed linearized model expressed by Eqs. (25.110) or (25.111), reported
here without the terms due to external forces and moments,

P ¨β + Q ˙β + U β = S(cid:4)δ + T (cid:4) ˙δ,
P ¨r + Q ˙r + Ur = S(cid:4)(cid:4)δ + T (cid:4)(cid:4) ˙δ .

(25.160)

If the variable for motion in the y direction is the lateral velocity v instead of the

sideslip angle β, the ﬁrst equation becomes

P ¨v + Q ˙v + U v = V S(cid:4)δ + V T (cid:4) ˙δ .

(25.161)

with a negative real part: the zeros lie in the left part of the Argand plane.

The situation may be different for the sideslip angle: S(cid:4) may be either positive or
negative depending on the values of the parameters. By using the simpliﬁed expres-
sions of the derivatives of stability, the value of the relevant transfer function is

it moves to the positive part of the Argand plane and then the system is a non-minimum
phase system.

From Eq. (25.110) and following it is clear that the response to steering is a linear
combination of the laws δ(t) and ˙δ(t). If the numerator of the transfer function is
linear in s, and if the zero of the transfer function (which is always real since the
numerator is linear) is negative, the coefﬁcients of the linear combination have the
same sign and the sign of the response does not change in time.

Then compute the response to a step steering input at a speed of 100 km/h.
The transfer function ay0

negative real zero up to a speed of 56.22 km/h; then it has a positive real zero.

At 100 km/h the mass-spring-damper system is underdamped, since the damping
ratio has a value ζ = 0.77. The natural frequency of the undamped system is ωn =
6.67 rad/s = 1.06 Hz, while the frequency of the free damped oscillations is ω p =
4.24 rad/s = 0.68 Hz.

The results are reported in Fig. 25.29b, c.
The step and impulse responses have the same sign for the yaw velocity, and they
simply add in modulus. In the response for the sideslip angle they have opposite sign
and initially the second one prevails. When, after some time, the ﬁrst one begins to
prevail, the sign of the response changes.

This is typical for non-minimum phase systems: the system initially reacts in a
direction opposite to that of the steady state response, then goes to zero and changes
its sign.

The integration to obtain the path must actually be performed numerically even in
the simplest cases where laws β(t) and r (t) may be computed in closed form owing
to the fact that angle ψ is usually too large to allow linearizing its trigonometric
functions even when using the linearized model. In general, it is more convenient to

Example 25.9 Study the motion with locked controls of the vehicle of Appendix E.2
following a step steering input.

Assume that the value of the steering angle is that needed to obtain a circular path

with a radius of 200 m at a speed of 100 km/h.

At 100 km/h the path curvature gain 1/Rδ is equal to 0.2472 1/m. To perform a
curve with a radius of 200 m, a steering angle δ = 0.0202 rad = 1.159◦ is needed.
In kinematic conditions, the radius of the path corresponding to the same value
of δ is 106.8 m. The fact that it is almost half the above was easily predictable, since
100 km/h is only slightly less than the characteristic speed.

The steady state values of r and β are respectively 0.1389 rad/s and −0.0131 rad

= −0.749◦.

The equation of motion of the vehicle was integrated numerically for a duration
of 30 s. The results are plotted in Fig. 25.30. The time histories of the yaw velocity
and sideslip angle are shown along with the path.

The steady-state conditions are reached after a few seconds, with a slightly under-

damped behavior.

Example 25.10 Study the motion with locked controls of the vehicle of Appendix
E.2 following a wind gust. Assume a step lateral gust, like the one encountered when
exiting a tunnel. Assume an ambient wind velocity va = 10 m/s and a vehicle speed
of 100 km/h.

The driver does not react to the gust and the steering angle is kept equal to zero.

where ψw is the angle between the direction of the relative velocity and the tangent
to the path. This is clearly an approximation since it relies on the linearity of the
aerodynamic forces and moments with the aerodynamic sideslip angle and holds
only if angle β + ψw remains small.

As the path of the vehicle curves after the manoeuvre, the components of the

relative velocity along the path and in a direction perpendicular to it are

yielding

The above relationships may be approximated by neglecting angle β.

airspeed, which is always considered at 100 km/h.

Fig. 25.31 Example 25.10: Response to a cross-wind gust. a Time histories of the yaw velocity
and sideslip angle and b path

The equation of motion of the vehicle has been integrated numerically for a
duration of 10 s. The results are plotted in Fig. 25.31. The time histories of the yaw
velocity and sideslip angle are shown along with the path.

Quasi steady-state conditions are again reached after a few seconds, with a slightly
underdamped behavior. The conditions are not actually steady-state since the direc-
tion of the wind is ﬁxed, while the direction of the vehicle axes change. However,
this effect is minimal for the duration of the manoeuvre, and a good approximation
could have been obtained by assuming a constant value for angle ψw (ψw increases
from 19.8◦ to 20.9◦ for t = 0 to t = 10 s).

At the end of the manoeuvre, the values of r and β are, respectively, 0.0505 rad/s
and −0.0036 rad = −0.2073◦. The errors linked to neglecting β in the above expres-
sion are thus negligible. The response in terms of β in this case is that typical of a
non-minimum phase system.

Example 25.11 The following manoeuvre is often performed by test drivers to assess
the handling and stability of a car: A step steering input is supplied and the steering
wheel is kept in position for a short time. The driver then releases the wheel and
the vehicle returns to a straight path. The whole manoeuvre is performed at constant
speed.

Study the motion of the vehicle of Appendix E.2 following a manoeuvre of this

kind with a 45◦ steering wheel input held for 1.5 s at 100 km/h.

value of δ: 2.81◦.

The ﬁrst part of the manoeuvre is the same as in Example 25.9, only with a greater

388

25 Handling Performance

The integration in time is performed in two parts: A locked controls model is used

for the ﬁrst 1.5 s; a free control model is used after the driver releases the wheel.

This second part of the simulation is performed using two alternative models: One
in which the dependence of tire forces on the derivative ˙α is neglected, and a second
in which the inertia and damping of the steering system are also not considered.

The time histories of the yaw velocity, sideslip angle and steering angle are

reported together with the path in Fig. 25.32.

The inertia of the steering system plays an important role in the response, since
it slows the recovery of the vehicle, thus affecting the path. It also increases the
oscillatory behavior of the vehicle, and if no damping is considered, an unstable
behavior emerges.

The effect of neglecting the inertia of the steering system can be veriﬁed by
comparing the poles of the system: If neither inertia nor damping is accounted for,
the two eigenvalues are −3.011 ± 7.709i, while the more complete model yields four
eigenvalues −9.129 ± 8.2921i and −1.065 ± 5.563i. The ﬁrst is quite damped and
is not important in the motion, but the second is clearly different from that obtained

from the simpler model. The high value of the steering ratio, whose square enters
the computation of the equivalent inertia of the steering wheel, is responsible for this
effect.

25.16 Vehicles with Two Steering Axles (4WS)

In the majority of vehicles with two axles, only the front wheels are provided with a
steering system. However, beginning in the 1980s, an increasing number of cars with
steering on all four wheels (4WS) appeared on the market, in the beginning most
of them Japanese. The primary goal was to improve manoeuvrability and handling
characteristics both in low- and high-speed steering. 4WS system were dealt with in
Part I, Chap. 6.

Simple four-wheel steering may be implemented by equipping the rear axle with
a compliance purposely designed to provide the required steering action under the
effect of road loads without adding an actual steering device. This approach is deﬁned
as passive steering. Active steering occurs when the rear axle is provided with a
second steering device, operated by the driver along with that of the front axle through
adequate actuators.

To reduce the radius of the path in low-speed (kinematic) conditions, the rear axle
must steer in a direction opposite to the front; if the absolute values of the steering
angles are equal, the radius is halved and the off-tracking of the rear axle is reduced
to zero. Using the notation introduced in the preceding sections, this situation is
characterized by

K (cid:4)
1

= 1 , K (cid:4)
2

= −1

(in the following it will always be assumed that K (cid:4)

= 1).

In practical terms, this value is too high since the rear axle would initially be
displaced too far to the outside of the line connecting the centres of the wheels in the
initial position, particularly when starting the motion with the wheels in a steered
position. It would be difﬁcult, for example, to move a vehicle parked near a curb or,
worse, near a wall.

In high-speed cornering the situation is different. The equation of motion is still
Eq. (25.108) and, if the speed V is constant, it is possible to use the spring-mass-
damper analogy (either Eq. (25.110) or (25.111)).

From the equations above it is clear that opposite steering (K (cid:4)

signs) produces an increase of the gains related to the curvature of the path, while
steering with the same sign allows larger cornering forces to be produced for the
same steering angle

However, the most important advantages of 4WS are felt in non-steady-state
conditions, making it important to assess the transfer functions in these conditions.

Opposite steering also makes the vehicle more responsive about the yaw axis
in non-steady-state conditions. The second transfer function shows how steering in
the same direction increases the response at the highest frequencies, in particular for
lateral acceleration due to motion in the y direction, while opposite steering increases
the contribution due to centrifugal acceleration, especially at low frequency.

Strong rear axle steering may cause some of the zeros of the transfer functions to
lie in the positive half-plane of the complex plane, making the system a non-minimum
phase system. This will be studied in greater detail in Chap. 27.

The limiting case of same sign steering is, for a vehicle with the center of mass

at mid-wheelbase, that with equal steering angles

K (cid:4)
1

= K (cid:4)
2

= 1 .

Remark 25.17 This is, however, too theoretical, since the vehicle would be quick in
a lane change, moving sideways, but would never be able to move on a curved path.
Instead of turning, it would move sideways.

Thus it is clear that the steering mechanism must adapt the value of K (cid:4)

2 to the
external conditions and to the requests of the driver. As seen in Part I, the simplest
strategy is to use a device, possibly mechanical, to link the two steering boxes with a
variable gear ratio: When angle δ is small, as typically occurs in high speed driving,
K (cid:4)
2 is positive and the steering angles have the same direction while when δ is large,
as occurs when manoeuvring at low speed, K (cid:4)
2 must be
much smaller than K (cid:4)
1.

2 is negative. Obviously, K (cid:4)

However, more complicated control laws for the steering of the rear axle must
be implemented to fully exploit the potential advantages of 4WS. The parameters
entering such laws are numerous, e.g., the speed V , the lateral acceleration, the
sideslip angles αi , etc. Such devices must be based on electronic controllers and
actuators of different types, and their implementation enters into the important ﬁeld
of autronics (Chap. 27).

From the viewpoint of mathematical modelling, the situation is, at least in prin-
ciple, simple. There is no difﬁculty in introducing a suitable function K (cid:4)
(V, δ, . . . )
2
into the equations (actually it would appear only in the derivatives of stability Yδ and
Nδ) and in modifying the equations of the rigid-body model seen above accordingly.
The more advanced models of the following sections can be modiﬁed along the same
lines. If function K (cid:4)
2 includes some of the state variables, the modiﬁcations can be
larger but no conceptual difﬁculty arises.

Except in the latter case, locked control stability is not affected by the introduction

of 4WS, while stability with free controls can be affected by it.

Generally speaking, the advantages of 4WS are linked with an increase in the
quickness of the response of the vehicle to a steering input, but this cannot be true for
all types of manoeuvres: Steering all axles in the same direction may make the vehicle
quick in lane change manoeuvres but slower in acquiring a given yaw velocity. The
sensations of the driver may be strange and, at least at the beginning, unpleasant. A
solution may be a device that initially steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction

392

25 Handling Performance

for a short time, to initiate a yaw rotation, and then steers them in the same direction
as the front wheels, to generate cornering forces. This requires a more complicated
control logic, possibly based on microprocessors.

As a ﬁnal consideration, most applications are based on vehicles already designed
for conventional steering to which 4WS is then added, normally as an option. In this
case, the steering of the rear wheel is limited to 1◦–2◦ or even less since the rear wheel
wells lack the space required for larger movement. Even if the car is designed from
the beginning for 4WS, a trade-off between its advantages and the loss of available
space in the trunk due to 4WS will take place.

25.17 Model with Four Degrees of Freedom for Articulated

Vehicles

25.17.1 Equations of Motion

An articulated vehicle modelled as two rigid bodies hinged to each other has, in its
motion on the road surface, four degrees of freedom (Fig. 25.33). The assumption of
rigid bodies implies that the hinge is cylindrical and that its axis is perpendicular to
the road: In practice different setups are used, but if rolling is neglected the present
one is the only possible layout.

There is no difﬁculty in writing the six equations of motion of the two rigid
bodies (each has three degrees of freedom in the planar motion on the road) and then
in introducing the two equations for the constraints due to the hinge to eliminate two
of the six. The forces exchanged between the two bodies are explicitly introduced.
Here a different approach is followed and the equations of motion are obtained
through Lagrange equations. To this end, a set of four generalized coordinated is ﬁrst
stated: X and Y are the inertial coordinates of the centre of mass of the tractor and
ψ is its yaw angle. They are the same coordinates used in the study of the insulated
vehicle. The added coordinate is angle θ between the longitudinal axes x of the tractor
and x R of the trailer. Positive angles are shown in Fig. 25.33.

Instead of angle θ, it is possible to use the yaw angle of the trailer ψR, i.e. the

angle between the inertial X -axis and the body-ﬁxed axis x R.

The model can be simpliﬁed and linearized, as seen for the model of the isolated
vehicle, by assuming that the motion occurs in a condition not much different from
the symmetrical, which implies that the trailer angle θ and the sideslip angles are
small. Moreover, the vehicle will be assumed to be a monotrack vehicle, i.e. the
sideslip angles of the wheels of each axle will be assumed to be equal. The model
will be built in terms of axles rather than wheels.

As a damper with damping coefﬁcient (cid:5) may be attached to the hinge between
tractor and trailer, a Raleigh dissipation function must be written along with the
kinetic energy. No conservative forces act in the plane of the road, assuming the hinge
has no elastic restoring force, and hence no potential energy need be computed.

25.17.2 Sideslip Angles of the Wheels

The sideslip angles of the wheels of the tractor are the same as for the insulated
vehicle. In a similar way, it is possible to write the sideslip angles of the wheels of
the trailer.

With reference to Fig. 25.34, the coordinates of point Pi , the centre of the contact

zone of the ith wheel of the trailer, are

X Pi
YPi

= X − c cos(ψ) − li cos (ψ − θ) − yRi sin (ψ − θ)
= Y − c sin(ψ) − li sin (ψ − θ) + yRi cos (ψ − θ) .

(25.208)

The velocity of the same point may be obtained by differentiating the expressions
of the coordinates. For the computation of the sideslip angle the velocity of point Pi
must be expressed in the reference frame GRxRyR of the trailer

(25.213)

The term in yRi does not enter the expression of the sideslip angle: The wheels of
the same axle have the same sideslip angle, and it is also possible to work in terms
of axles instead of single wheels for the trailer.

The steering angle δi is either 0 or, if the axle can steer, is usually not directly
controlled by the driver but is linked with the variables of the motion, e.g. with angle
θ. If law δi (θ) is simply

δi = −K (cid:4)

25.17.3 Generalized Forces

The contributions to the generalized forces Q x , Q y and Qψ due to the tractor are the
same as those of the insulated vehicle. The tractor does not give any contribution to
force Qθ. To compute the contributions due to the ith wheel of the trailer and the
aerodynamic forces of the latter, the easiest method is to write their virtual work δL
due to a virtual displacement

{δs} = [δx, δ y, δψ, δθ]T .

Using the assumption of small angles, it follows that

(cid:4)

δx R(Pi ) = δx − θδ y + cθδψ − yRi
(δψ − δθ)
δ yR(Pi ) = θδx + δ y − cδψ − li (δψ − δθ) .

(25.215)

If the ith wheel has a steering angle δi , the forces it exerts in the reference frame
GR x R yR z R, the same in which the virtual displacement has been written, are simply

Fxi R
Fyi R

− Fyi p δi ,
= Fxi p cos(δi ) − Fyi p sin(δi ) ≈ Fxi p
,
= Fxi p sin(δi ) + Fyi p cos(δi ) ≈ Fxi p δi + Fyi p

(25.216)

where Fxi p and Fyi p are the forces in the reference frame of the tire.

In a similar way, the generalized forces resulting from the aerodynamic forces
and moments acting on the trailer can be accounted for. It is usually difﬁcult to
distinguish between the forces acting on the tractor and those acting on the trailer,
as what is measured in the wind tunnel are the forces acting on the whole vehicle. In
the following equations, it will be assumed that the forces acting on the tractor are
measured separately from those acting on the trailer, and that they are applied at the
centre of mass of the relevant rigid body and decomposed along the axes ﬁxed to it.
The forces acting on the trailer are so decomposed along axes x R yR z R.

The generalized forces due to aerodynamic forces acting on the tractor contribute
to Q x , Q y and Qψ just as they do for the insulated vehicle, while the expression
of the generalized aerodynamic forces applied on the trailer can be obtained from
Eqs. (25.218), by substituting Fx Raer , FyRaer , Mz Raer and aR to Fxi p , Fyi p , Mzi and li
and by setting both yRi and δi to zero.

The external force FyeR

acting on the centre of mass or the trailer and the com-
ponent of the weight m Rg sin(α) due to a longitudinal grade α of the road will be
assumed to act in the directions of axes x and y of the tractor; consequently the
relevant equations must be modiﬁed accordingly.

25.17.4 Linearized Expressions of the Forces

The linearized expressions of the generalized forces Q x , Q y, Qψ and Qθ can be
obtained with the methods used for the isolated vehicle. Linearization can be per-

formed by introducing the cornering and aligning stiffnesses Ci and (Mzi
axles (subscript i refers now to the ith axle and not to the ith wheel). In the same way,
the derivatives of the aerodynamic coefﬁcients (C y),β, etc. can also be introduced.

A simple expression for Q x is thus obtained:

25.17.5 Final Expression of the Equations of Motion

As with the equations of the insulated vehicle, the linearization of the equations allows
the longitudinal behavior (ﬁrst equation of motion) to be uncoupled from the lateral,
or handling behavior, which can be studied using only the three remaining equations.
This occurs if the law u(t), which can be confused with V (t), is considered as a stated
law, while the unknowns are the driving or braking forces Fx for the longitudinal
behavior and β, r and θ for handling.

The linearized equation for the longitudinal behavior

m ˙V = Q x

(25.224)

can thus be studied separately.

The linearized equations for the lateral behavior of the articulated vehicle can be

expressed in the space of the conﬁgurations as

M¨x + C˙x + Kx = F ,

The set of differential equations (25.225) is actually of the fourth order and not

derivatives (the ﬁrst two columns of matrix K vanish). The equation can thus be

25.17.6 Steady-State Motion

There is no difﬁculty in solving such a set of equations. For instance, after stating
that δ = 1 and setting all other inputs to zero, the gains 1/Rδ, β/δ etc. can be
computed.

A particularly simple solution is obtained for a two-axle vehicle with a one-axle

trailer if only the cornering forces of the wheels are accounted for

The same deﬁnitions used for the insulated vehicle also hold in this case and, if the
derivatives of stability are constant or proportional to 1/V , the sign of the stability
factor allows one to state immediately whether the vehicle is oversteer, neutral-steer
or understeer.

The simpliﬁed expression of the stability factor (25.230) is composed of two
terms: The ﬁrst usually has the same sign of bC1 − aC2 , i.e. of the factor that
decides the behavior of the tractor alone. The second term is negative, unless the
product c(l R − aR) is negative, i.e. the centre of mass of the trailer is behind its axle.

If

c(l R − aR) > 0 ,

the trailer increases the understeering character of the vehicle, more so if the hinge
is far from the centre of mass of the tractor and the centre of mass of the trailer is
close to the hinge. In the case of trailers with a single axle, like caravans, this effect
can be reduced by reducing the distance between its centre of mass and the axle.

If the centre of mass is exactly on the axle, that is, if

the trailer has no effect on the steady state behavior of the tractor; it does, however,
affect its dynamic behavior and stability.

If the centre of mass of the trailer is behind its axle,

l R − aR = 0 ,

l R − aR < 0 ,

the trailer increases the oversteer behavior of the tractor. If the vehicle is oversteer,
the presence of a critical speed can be expected.

Remark 25.18 This way of comparing the behavior of the tractor alone with that of
the complete vehicle is not correct however: The presence of the trailer can change
the loads on the wheels of the former, thus affecting their cornering stiffness.

Example 25.12 Study the steady state directional behavior of the articulated truck of
Appendix E.10. Compare the results obtained using the complete expressions of the
derivatives of stability with those computed considering only the cornering forces of
the tires.

The computation is straightforward. At each value of the speed the normal forces
on the ground must be computed, although they change little with the speed. The
cornering stiffness and the aligning stiffness of the axles are readily obtained from
the normal forces.

At 100 km/h, for instance, the normal forces on the axles are 57.25, 107.28, 79.83,
83.56 and 56.14 kN, yielding the following values for the cornering stiffness and the
aligning stiffness: 422.05, 806.64, 641.34, 665.89, 416.42 kN/rad and 22.724, 41.472,
26.102, 28.175, 22.116 kNm/rad.

The path curvature gain, the sideslip angle gain and the trailer angle gain θ/δ are
plotted as functions of the speed in Fig. 25.35. The values obtained from the complete
expressions of the derivatives of stability are shown as full lines while the dashed
lines refer to the simpliﬁed expressions for the derivatives of stability obtained by
considering only the cornering forces.

When the speed tends to zero, the path curvature gain does not tend to the kinematic
value 1/l of the tractor: The trailer has a number of axles greater than 1 and correct
kinematic steering is impossible. The vehicle is understeer, even if weakly.

The simpliﬁed approach allows one to obtain a fair approximation of the direc-
tional behavior of the vehicle, the differences between the two results being due
mostly to the aligning torques of the tires and only marginally to aerodynamic forces
and moments.

25.17.7 Stability and Nonstationary Motion

The study of the stability in the small, i.e., for small changes of the state of the system
around the equilibrium conditions, may be performed by computing the eigenvalues
of the dynamic matrix. The plot of the eigenvalues (their real and imaginary parts)
as functions of the speed and the plot of the roots locus give a picture of the stability
of the system that can be easily interpreted.

The eigenvalues of the system are four; two of these are usually complex conjugate
showing an oscillatory behavior; the corresponding eigenvector shows that the motion
of the trailer is primarily involved. These oscillations are usually lightly damped, and
can become, mainly at high speed, self excited leading to a global instability of the
vehicle.

Remark 25.19 The presence of an eigenvalue with positive real part, and hence of
an instability in the mathematical sense, is felt by the driver as a source of discomfort
rather than an actual instability. If the values of both the imaginary and the real parts
of the eigenvalue are small enough, i.e., if the frequency is low and the amplitude
grows slowly, the driver is forced to introduce continuous steering corrections without
actually recognizing the instability of the vehicle.

The introduction of a damper at the trailer-tractor connection can solve this prob-
lem, while the use of steering axles on the trailer makes things worse. A steering
axle, controlled so that the wheels steer in the direction opposite to those of the trac-
tor with a magnitude proportional to angle θ, provides a restoring force to keep the
trailer aligned with the tractor. The effect is similar to that of increasing the stiffness
of a system: If the damping is not increased the underdamped character is magniﬁed,
while the natural frequency is also increased.

For the study of motion in nonstationary conditions, the considerations already
seen for the insulated vehicle still hold. The more complicated nature of the equations
of motion, however, compels us to resort to numerical integration in a larger number
of cases.

Example 25.13 Study the stability with locked controls of the articulated truck of
Appendix E.10.

The plot of the real and imaginary parts of s and the roots locus are shown in

Fig. 25.36.

The ﬁgure has been obtained using the complete expressions of the derivatives of
stability, but neglecting the effect of driving forces. At 100 km/h the eigenvalues are

−2.3364 ± 1.5896i , −2.2698 ± 3.4037i;

the corresponding eigenvectors are

The vehicle has a strong oscillatory behavior, even if both modes are well damped
and no dynamic instability occurs; both modes involve the tractor as well as the trailer.

Example 25.14 Study the directional response and the stability with locked con-
trols of the car of Appendix E.5 with a caravan with a single axle. Assume the
following data for the caravan: Mass m R = 600 kg, moment of inertia JR = 800
kg m2, c = 2.87 m, aR = l3 = 2.5 m, h R = 1 m, SR = 2.5 m2; (CYR
),β = −1.5,
(C N R

),β = −0.6. Assume that the trailer has the same tires as used on the tractor.
The path curvature gain, sideslip angle gain and trailer angle gain are plotted
against the speed in Fig. 25.37. Both the complete and simpliﬁed expressions of the
derivatives of stability have been used, while the effect of driving forces has been
neglected.

Note that the curve obtained from the simpliﬁed expressions of the derivatives of
stability is completely superimposed on that describing the behavior of the insulated
vehicle, as was predictable since aR = l3. Note also that the path curvature gain tends
to the kinematic value for a speed tending to zero, since the trailer has a single axle
and correct kinematic steering is possible.

The plot of the real and imaginary parts of s and the roots locus are reported in
Fig. 25.38a, b. Here only the complete expressions of the derivatives of stability have

variable s is quite low at high speed, denoting a strong and little damped oscillatory
motion, which occurs at low frequency.

To compare the behavior of the vehicle with and without trailer the computation

has been repeated without the latter and the results are shown in Fig. 25.38c, d.

The comparison shows that the modes affecting primarily the vehicle are fairly
uncoupled from those primarily affecting the trailer, although a correct analysis of
such coupling demands a through analysis of the eigenvectors.

The trailer mode with low frequency and low dynamic stability is superimposed
on the more stable tractor mode, which is not strongly affected by the presence of
the trailer. The motion of the tractor in the trailer mode can also be quite large, as
this mode affects the whole system.

Example 25.15 Study the stability with locked controls of the car of Appendix E.2
with the caravan of Example 25.14. Assume that the tires of the caravan are the same
as those used on the tractor. Then study the motion with locked controls of the same
vehicle following a step steering input at 80 and 140 km/h. Assume that the value
of the steering angle is that needed to obtain a circular path with a radius of 200 m,
computed neglecting the presence of the trailer.

The plot of the real and imaginary parts of s and the roots locus computed using
the complete expressions of the derivatives of stability are shown in Fig. 25.40a, b.
The vehicle is stable only up to a speed of about 120 km/h, where the real part of the
Laplace variable s related to one of the two modes vanishes, to become positive at
higher speed.

The absolute value of the real part of s is always quite low, denoting a marginal

dynamic stability at low speed and a marginal instability at higher speed.

Complete expressions of the derivatives of stability, with the effect of driving forces neglected

This type of behavior is quite evident in the response to a step steering input. The
steering angle needed to obtain a radius of the path of 200 m is 0.9659◦ at 80 km/h
and 1.7271◦ at 140 km/h. The integration of the equation of motion was performed
numerically. At 80 km/h the response is stable but the step input excites a strong,
slowly damped, oscillatory behavior (Fig. 25.40a).

The strong oscillatory behavior is primarily due to the trailer, and the time history
showing more pronounced oscillations is that of the trailer angle θ. After 6 s the
values of r/V δ, βδ and θδ are almost stabilized at the values of 0.3018, −0.4056
and 0.3098 that characterize the steady state behavior (the former two are almost the
same as those obtained for the vehicle without trailer, except for a small difference
due to the difference in aerodynamic drag, which inﬂuences the loads on the road
and hence the cornering stiffness). The path is, however, not oscillatory.

25.17 Model with Four Degrees of Freedom for Articulated Vehicles

411

At 140 km/h the vehicle is unstable and the oscillations of r , β and θ quickly

diverge. The path reported in Fig. 25.39b, however, is not strongly oscillatory.

This example is a limiting case since the trailer is not correctly matched to the
vehicle, nor are the tires correct for the trailer; it has been shown as an example of
unstable behavior occurring in an incorrectly designed vehicle with trailer.

Note that a step input is prone to excite strongly an unstable behavior and is
the worst thing to do with a marginally stable vehicle. The oscillations have a low
frequency, and it is possible that the driver may be able to stabilize the vehicle even

at speeds at which the real part of s is positive: A test driver would probably ﬁnd the
handling and comfort of the vehicle poor rather than seeing the vehicle as unstable,
owing to the need for continuous steering corrections.

On the other hand, it is possible that a vehicle with a low negative real part of s
becomes unstable because of the action of the driver. Ultimately, the stability of the
vehicle-driver system is what counts, but intrinsic stability of the vehicle is necessary,
so that the driver is not forced to stabilize a system that is itself unstable.

25.18 Multibody Articulated Vehicles

25.18.1 Equations of Motion

Consider a vehicle with a trailer with two axles, one connected to its body, the other
connected to the draw bar (Fig. 25.41a). Its dynamic behavior may be studied using
the same kind of model seen in the previous section, where the trailer is modelled as
two simple trailers connected in sequence. The model has ﬁve degrees of freedom, and
the ﬁve generalized coordinates may be X Y , ψ, θ1 and θ2. The ﬁrst two coordinates
can be substituted by displacements x and y referred to the frame of the tractor and
the ﬁrst equation for longitudinal motion may be decoupled from the others, if the
equations of motion are linearized. The transversal behavior can be studied using a
set of four differential equations that can be linearized under the usual conditions,
yielding a set of linear differential equations whose order is 6.

This procedure can be generalized to a generic multibody vehicle made of a tractor
and a set of n trailers (Fig. 25.41b). Note that while in Europe no vehicle with multiple
trailers is legal for road use, in America and Australia such vehicles are legal but
subject to restrictions. The model here described, leading to a set of n + 3 differential
equations (n + 2 for the lateral behavior if the ﬁrst equation is uncoupled), allows
one to study the behavior of any vehicle of this type.

With reference to Fig. 25.41b, the position of the centre of mass of the ith trailer

The contributions to the generalized forces Q x , Q y and Qψ due to the tractor
are the same as for the insulated vehicle. As usual, the tractor does not give any
contribution to the forces Qθk . To compute the contributions due to the r th wheel of
the ith trailer and to the aerodynamic forces of the latter, it is possible to proceed as
for the previous models, by writing their virtual work and then differentiating with
respect to the virtual displacements.

The generalized forces due to the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on
the trailers can be accounted for in a similar way. Assuming that it is possible to
distinguish between the forces acting on the various rigid bodies, the generalized
forces can be computed immediately from Eqs. (25.243), using li j instead of l ∗
i j ,
setting δir to zero and using the aerodynamic forces and moments instead of the
forces acting between road and wheels.

The external forces Fyei

acting in the centres of mass of the trailers and the

x and y of the tractor; the expressions of the generalized forces must therefore be
modiﬁed accordingly.

The equations of motion are n + 3; together with the equations yielding the
sideslip angles of the wheels, those expressing the forces and moments of the tires
as functions of the sideslip angles, the load, and the other relevant parameters, they
allow one to study the handling of the vehicle.

As was the case for all the previous models, the linearization of the equations
allows one to uncouple the longitudinal behavior (ﬁrst equation of motion) from the
lateral behavior, which can be studied using the remaining n + 2 equations:

By linearizing the generalized forces Q x , Q y, Qψ and Qθk as for the previous

models, the derivatives of stability entering Eq. (25.245) are readily computed.

The set of (n + 2) differential equations (25.245) is of the (2n + 2)-th order, since
variables y and ψ appear in the equation only as ﬁrst and second derivatives. The
equation can thus be written in the state space in the form of a set of 2n + 2 ﬁrst-order
differential equations by introducing the state variables vθi

= ˙θi .

25.19 Limits of Linearized Models

Linearized models have some features that make them particularly useful. These are
namely:
• They allow us to simplify the equations of motion to obtain closed form solutions
which, when simple enough, provide a general insight into the dynamic behavior
of the vehicle, particularly in terms of the effect of changes to its parameters.
• The possibility of studying the stability with the usual methods of linear dynamics.

25.19 Limits of Linearized Models

419

The disadvantages are also clear: Linearized models can be applied only within
a limited range of sideslip angles and lateral acceleration, and used for trajectories
whose radius is large with respect to the size of the vehicle. They can thus be applied
with conﬁdence to the conditions corresponding to normal vehicle use, while they
fail for sport driving and above all for the motions involved in road accidents.

Another consideration for the models seen in the present chapter is that they are
based on rigid body dynamics, with the presence of the suspensions neglected. This
assumption is well suited to describe the behavior of a vehicle driven in a relaxed
way: Although dependent on the stiffness of the suspensions, the roll and pitch angles
under these conditions are very small and may be assumed to have little effect on the
dynamic behavior.

It must, however, be stated that a linearization carried too far will lead to results

contradicting experimental evidence.

If the cornering stiffness is assumed to be proportional to the load Fz acting on
the wheel not only for the small load variations acting on each wheel but also for
the differences of load between front and rear axle, in the case of a vehicle with two
axles with equivalent tires it follows that

C1
C2

= Fz1
Fz2

= b
a

.

(25.246)

If only the cornering forces of the tires are included in the formula for the neutral-
steer point, it follows that this point always coincides with the centre of mass, leading
to the conclusion, clearly incorrect, that all vehicles with four equivalent wheels are
neutral-steer.

Chapter 26
Comfort Performance

The deﬁnition of comfort in a motor vehicle is at once complex and subjective,
changing not only with time (cars considered comfortable just twenty years ago
are nowadays considered unsatisfactory) but also from user to user. The same user
may change his appraisal depending on circumstances and his psycho-physical state.
But comfort remains an increasingly important parameter in customer choice and a
strongly competitive factor among manufacturers.

This chapter will deal primarily with vibrational comfort, although it is difﬁcult
to separate it from acoustic comfort without entering into details linked more with
the driveability and handling of the vehicle. Not just driving comfort, but vibrational
and acoustic comfort as well (the latter deeply affects the conditions in which the
driver operates), all have a strong impact on vehicle safety.

It is possible to distinguish between vibrational and acoustic comfort—linked
with the vibration and noise produced inside vehicles by mechanical devices or on
its surface by the air—and ride comfort, which is linked primarily with the ability of
the tires and the suspensions to ﬁlter out vibration caused by motion on a road that
is not perfectly smooth.

With this distinction in mind, SAE deﬁnes:

• ride, low frequency (up to 5 Hz) vibration of the vehicle body
• shake, vibration at intermediate frequency (between 5 and 25 Hz), at which some

natural frequencies of subsystems of the vehicle occur

• harshness, high frequency vibration (between 25 and 100 Hz) of the structure and

its components, felt primarily as noise

• noise, acoustic phenomena occurring between 100 Hz and 22 kHz, i.e. up to the

threshold of human hearing.
Comfort Performance

26.1 Internal Excitation

The sources of vibration on board a vehicle are essentially three: The wheels, the
driveline and the engine. All contain rotating parts and, as a consequence, a ﬁrst cause
of dynamic excitation is imbalance. A rotor is perfectly balanced when its rotation
axis coincides with one of its principal axes of inertia; however, this condition can
only be met approximately and balancing tolerances must be stated for any rotating
object.1 As a consequence of the residual imbalance a rotating object exerts on its
supports, a force whose frequency is equal to the rotational speed (cid:2) and its amplitude
is proportional to its square (cid:2)2. Because the engine, the driveline and the wheels
rotate at different speeds, the excitations they cause are characterized by different
frequencies.

Apart from the excitation due to imbalance, there are other effects that are peculiar
to each element. Wheels may show geometrical and structural irregularities. The
outer shape of the tires cannot be exactly circular and is characterized by a runout
(eccentricity) having the same effect as mass imbalance, exciting vibrations with a
frequency equal to the rotational speed, plus other harmonic components which excite
higher harmonics. An ovalization of the shape excites a vibration with frequency
equal to 2(cid:2), a triangular shape with frequency 3(cid:2), etc. The very presence of the
tread excites higher frequencies, which are usually found in the acoustic range; to
avoid a strong excitation with a period equal to the time of passage of the single tread
element, the pattern of the tread is usually made irregular, with randomly spaced
elements.

The same effect occurs for variations of stiffness; these induce dynamic forces
with frequencies equal to the rotational speed and its multiples. As various harmonics
are present in differing degrees in different tires, the spectrum of the dynamic force
exerted by the tire on the unsprung mass depends upon each tire. As is common in
the dynamics of machinery, such a typical spectrum is referred to as the mechanical
signature of the tire.

When the wheel is called upon to exert longitudinal and transversal forces, the
irregularities, both geometrical and structural, also introduce dynamic components in
these directions. The tire-wheel assembly, however, is a complex mechanical element
with given elastic and damping properties that can ﬁlter out some of the frequencies
produced at the road-tire interface. High frequencies are primarily ﬁltered out by the
tire itself, before being further ﬁltered by the suspension. These frequencies are felt
onboard primarily as airborne vibration, i.e. noise.

The excitation due to driveline imbalance is usually transferred to the vehicle body
through its soft mountings. The transmission is, however, made of ﬂexible elements
and, particularly at high frequency, these may have resonances. A long drive shaft
has its own critical speeds, and in the case of a two-span shaft with a central joint
(common in front-engine, rear-drive layouts), a critical speed, corresponding to a
mode in which the two spans behave as rigid bodies on a compliant central support,
is usually located within the working range. If the balancing of the central joint is
poor, strong vibration occurs when crossing this critical speed.

When Hooke’s joints are present, torque pulsations occurring when the input and
output shaft are at an angle can be a major problem. In modern front wheel drive cars,
the joints near the wheels are of the constant-speed type to avoid vibration, but care
must be taken to design the driveline layout to avoid excitations from these joints.

The engine is a major source of vibration and noise caused by imbalance of rotating
parts, inertial forces from reciprocating elements and time variations of the driving
torque. The excitation due to imbalance of rotating parts, mostly the crankshaft, has
the frequency of the engine speed (cid:2). To reduce it, the crankshaft must be balanced
accurately. The reciprocating masses produce forcing functions with frequencies that
are equal to (cid:2) and its multiples, in particular 2(cid:2) and 4(cid:2).

The components with frequency (cid:2) interact with those due to imbalance and can
be reduced by using counter-rotating shafts with eccentric masses. Their compen-
sation depends on the architecture of the engine, and above all on the number of
cylinders; they are particularly strong in single cylinder engines, such as those used
on many motor cycles. The simplest way to partially compensate for them is to use
a counterbalance slightly larger than that used to compensate for the imbalance of
rotating masses (this technique is usually referred to as overbalancing). To reduce
components with frequency 2(cid:2), it is possible to use shafts counter-rotating at a speed
twice the speed of the crankshaft, a practice fairly common on the engines of luxury
cars.

Torsional vibration of the engine is another important source of vibration. Tor-
sional vibrations of the engine were traditionally regarded as having little effect on
comfort, important only for the structural survival of the mechanical components of
the engine, in particular the crankshaft. This is, however, increasingly unrealistic,
and the excitation caused by torsional vibration is increasingly seen as important for
vehicle comfort.

The reason for this is the increasing number and mass of the ancillary devices, such
as larger generators for coping with the increasing electrical needs of the vehicle, air
conditioning compressors, power steering pumps, etc., that are located on brackets
and driven by belts. Torsional vibration from the engine can set the system made by
accessories, their brackets, belts covers, etc. into vibration. These vibrations are then
transferred to both engine and structure, producing noise both inside the vehicle and
outside, because these accessories are usually located close to the cooling air intakes.
The use of diesel engines makes things worse, because the more abrupt changes
of pressure in the combustion chamber lead to strong high-order harmonics in tor-
sional vibration. All vehicular diesel engines, and nowadays also spark ignition
engines, have torsional vibration dampers, of the viscous (on industrial vehicles)
or elastomeric type (passenger vehicles), but they may be not enough. More com-
plex dampers have been introduced, both for reducing vibration of the crankshaft
and for insulating the accessories. Moreover, the geometry of the engine is such that
it is impossible to distinguish, at least as a ﬁrst approximation, between torsional,
axial and ﬂexural vibration of the crankshaft.

424

26 Comfort Performance

Vibrations linked to the thermodynamic cycle have a fundamental frequency
which, in four-stroke engines, is equal to half the rotational speed but a large num-
ber of harmonics are usually present. Because a reciprocating engine usually has a
number of torsional critical speeds, its dynamics is quite complicated. It has been
the object of many studies and the subject of many books.2

The harmonics whose order is equal to the number of cylinders and its multiples
are usually referred to as major harmonics; these often are the most dangerous. In
the case of a four-in-line engine the frequency of the lowest major harmonics is 2(cid:2),
coinciding with one of the forcing functions due to reciprocating masses. A partial
compensation is often performed by setting the shaft counter-rotating at a speed 2(cid:2)
in unsymmetrical position.

The design of the engine suspension system is a complex issue. The elimination
of the sources of vibration, e.g., using dampers on the crankshaft or counterbalance
shafts spinning at twice the rotational speed, properly insulating the engine from
the vehicle structure by using adequate soft mountings and dampers, and insulating
the passenger compartment for noise, are all useful provisions for increasing ride
comfort. The engine suspension should be soft, to insulate the vehicle from vibration
due to the engine, but must be stiff enough to avoid large relative motion between
engine and vehicle.

The engine suspension is subject to a constant load, the weight of the engine, and
to variable loads, such as inertia forces due to reciprocating parts and the motion of
the vehicle, and a torque equal and opposite to the engine torque. The latter changes
rapidly from zero to its maximum value, but can also change its sign when the engine
is used to brake the vehicle.

Engine and gearbox are often in one piece, and in this case the torque acting on
the engine suspension is the torque at the output of the gearbox (3–5 times the engine
torque). If the differential is also inside the gearbox, the torque is that at the output
of the ﬁnal reduction, which may be as large as 10–14 times the engine torque.

The solution once universally accepted, based on three elastomeric supports, is
nowadays often replaced by a solution based on two elastomeric supports plus a
connecting rod, hinged at its ends by two elastomeric supports, that reacts to the
driving torque

The engine suspension must be designed with the aim of reducing, as much as
possible, the transmission of engine vibration to the vehicle, but also allowing for the
fact that the stresses in the engine components are inﬂuenced by how the engine is
attached to the vehicle. The transmission of commands to the engine and, in particular,
to the gearbox, is important in reducing the transmission of vibration to the vehicle.
Instead of using rigid rods to transfer commands to the gearbox, it is convenient to
use ﬂexible cables or even to avoid mechanical transmission of commands altogether
(servo-controlled gearbox).

Together with the conventional solutions based on elastomeric supports, more
advanced and even active solutions in which it is possible to change the relevant
parameters are now used.

The engine suspension can be used as a kind of dynamic vibration absorber. The
engine mass, the compliance and the damping of its support constitute a damped
vibration absorber that can be tuned on the main wheel hop resonance, about 12–15
Hz, to control vertical shake vibration due to wheel excitation.

The contribution to overall noise due to aerodynamics can be large and often, as
discussed in Chap. 21, has speciﬁc causes that may be different from those causing
aerodynamic drag. Aerodynamic noise is primarily caused by vortices and detached
ﬂow on the front part of the vehicle, generally in the zone close to the windshield and
the ﬁrst strut (pillar A). The wake and aerodynamic ﬁeld at the rear of the vehicle,
important in causing aerodynamic drag, usually make a limited contribution to overall
noise.

Active noise cancellation is a promising way to increase acoustic comfort. Already
applied in aeronautics, the ﬁrst automotive applications in the form of active engine
mufﬂers and passenger compartment noise control are due to appear soon. With the
introduction of active noise control, more advanced goals than pure noise suppres-
sion can be achieved. As an example, experience in the ﬁeld of rail transportation
has shown that complete noise suppression is not considered satisfactory by most
passengers, as it decreases privacy by allowing others to listen to what people are
saying. A completely noiseless machine may seem unnatural (in the ﬁeld of domestic
appliances there have been cases of dishwashers considered too quiet by their users),
and may even be dangerous in some automotive applications. The ultimate goal may
not be to suppress noise, but to achieve a noise that users ﬁnd pleasant.

Similarly, absolute vibration suppression may be undesirable because vibration
conveys useful information to the driver and can give warning symptoms of anoma-
lies. Here again the goal seems more to supply a vibrational environment the user
ﬁnds satisfactory than to completely suppress all vibrational input.

26.2 Road Excitation

Knowledge of the excitation due to motion on uneven roadis important for the study
of riding comfort. Road excitation reduces the ability of the tires to exert forces in
the x and y direction, because it causes a variable normal load Fz, and increases the
stressing of the structural elements. Because such excitation cannot be studied with
a deterministic approach, the methods used for random vibrations must be applied.
A number of studies have been devoted to characterizing road proﬁles experimen-
tally and interpreting the results statistically. From experimental measurements of
the road proﬁle (Fig. 26.1), a law h(x) can be deﬁned and its power spectral density
obtained through harmonic analysis. Note that the proﬁle is a function of space and
not of time, and the frequency referred to space ω is expressed in rad/m or cycles/m

426

26 Comfort Performance

Fig. 26.1 Examples of road proﬁles

and not in rad/s or in Hz. The power spectral density S of law h(x) is thus expressed
in m2/(rad/m) or in m2/(cycles/m).

The law S(ω) can be expressed by a straight line on a logarithmic plot, i.e. by the

law

S = cω−n ,

(26.1)

where n is a nondimensional constant while the dimensions of c depend on n (if n =
2, c is expressed in m2(cycles/m), for instance).

An old I.S.O. proposal3 suggested n = 2 for road undulations, i.e. for disturbances
with a wavelength greater than 6 m, and n = 1.37 for irregularities, with a wavelength
smaller than the mentioned value. The proposal stated various values of c depending
on the type of road.

A more recent approach is to abandon the distinction between undulations and

irregularities. Often used values are

c = 4.7 × 10−6 m3
c = 8.1 × 10−7 m3

n = 2.1 highway,
n = 2.1 road in poor conditions.

(26.2)

A4 recent ISO proposal subdivides road proﬁles into eight classes, indicated by
letters from A to H, stating an exponent always equal to 2 for Eq. (26.1). The values
of constant c for the various proﬁles are shown in Table 26.1. Classes from A to D
are for hard-surfaced roads, with A for very smooth roads. Classes E and F are for

Remark 26.1 If n = 2, as is suggested by the most recent ISO standards, the power
spectral density of the displacement is proportional to ω−2 and thus the power spectral
density of the vertical velocity is constant: Road excitation is then equivalent to white
noise in terms of vertical velocity of the contact point.

The law S(ω) at various speeds for a road at the limit between the B and C classes

(a fair but not very good road) following ISO standards is plotted in Fig. 26.3.

Once the power spectral density S(ω) of the excitation (namely of function h(t))
and the frequency response H (ω) of the vehicle are known, the power spectral density
of the response Sr (ω) is easily computed as

Sr (ω) = H 2(ω)S(ω) .

(26.5)

The root mean square (r.m.s.) value of the response is the square root of the
power spectral density integrated in the relevant frequency range. If, for instance,
the frequency response H (ω) is the ratio between the amplitude of the acceleration

To summarize the quality of a road proﬁle in a single ﬁgure an International
Roughness Index (IRI), referring not to the road itself but to the way a given standard
quarter-car model (see below) reacts to it, was introduced. Because it refers to a
particular model, the so-called quarter-car with two degrees of freedom, it will be
dealt with when we discuss suspension models.

26.3 Effects of Vibration on the Human Body

The ability of the human body to withstand vibration and related discomfort has been
the object of countless studies and several standards on the subject have been stated.
ISO 2631 standard (Fig. 26.4),6 distinguishes between vibrations with a frequency
in the range between 0.5 and 80 Hz that may cause a reduction of comfort, fatigue,
and health problems, and vibrations with a frequency in the range between 0.1 and
0.5 Hz that may cause motion sickness.

Standards refer to the acceleration due to vibration and suggest weighting func-
tions of the frequency to compute the root mean square values of the acceleration.
Such functions depend both on the point of the body where the acceleration is applied
and the direction along which it acts.

Figure 26.4, shows the r.m.s. value of the acceleration causing, in a given time, a
reduction of physical efﬁciency. The exposure limits can be obtained by multiplying
the values reported in the ﬁgure by 2, while the “reduced comfort boundary” is
obtained by dividing the same values by 3.15 (i.e., by decreasing the r.m.s. value by
10 dB). From the plot it is clear that the frequency range in which humans are more
affected by vibration lies between 4 and 8 Hz.

As already stated, frequencies lower than 0.5–1 Hz produce sensations that may
be associated with motion sickness. They depend on many parameters other than
acceleration and vary among individuals. Between 1 and 4 Hz, the ability of humans
to tolerate acceleration decreases with the frequency, reaching a minimum between
4 and 8 Hz. Between 8 and 80 Hz this tolerance increases again in a practically linear
law with frequency. In practice, what creates discomfort in that range is not so much
acceleration, but the ratio between acceleration and frequency.

Above 80 Hz the effect of vibration depends upon the part of the body involved,
as local vibrations become the governing factor, making it impossible to give gen-
eral guidelines. There are also resonance ﬁelds at which some parts of the body

vibrate with particularly large amplitudes. As an example, the thorax-abdomen sys-
tem has a resonant frequency at about 3–6 Hz, although all resonant frequency values
depend strongly upon individual characteristics. The head-neck-shoulder system has
a resonant frequency at about 20–30 Hz, and many other organs have more or less
pronounced resonances at other frequencies (e.g., the eyeball at 60–90 Hz, the lower
jaw-skull system at 100–220 Hz, etc.).

Essentially similar results are plotted in Fig. 26.5. The plots are related to equal

discomfort lines following BSI 6472 (a) and VDI 2057 (b).

Other curves related to vertical and horizontal vibration from various sources
and reported by M.W. Sayers, S.M. Karamihas, The Little Book of Proﬁling, The
University of Michigan, 1998, are plotted in Fig. 26.6.

Remark 26.2 The lower natural frequencies, those linked with the motion of the
sprung mass, must be high enough to avoid motion sickness, but low enough to be
well below 4 Hz. A common choice is to locate them in the range between 1.2 and
1.6 Hz. Higher frequencies, those due to the motion of unsprung masses, should be
well above 8–10 Hz. A good choice could be to locate them around 15–20 Hz.

26.4 Quarter-Car Models

The simplest model for studying the suspension motions of a vehicle is the so-called
quarter-car model, including a single wheel with related suspension and the part of
the body whose weight is imposed on it. Often, in four-wheeled vehicles, the quarter
vehicle including the suspension and the wheels is called a corner of the vehicle. The
quarter-car model may be more or less complex, including not only the compliance

of the suspension, but the compliance of the tire and also that of the rubber mounts
connecting the frame carrying the suspension to the body. It may even include the
inertia of the tire.

Three models based on the quarter-car approach are shown in Fig. 26.7.

432

26 Comfort Performance

Fig. 26.7 Quarter-car models with one (a), two (b) and three (c) degrees of freedom

The ﬁrst model has a single degree of freedom. The tires are considered rigid
bodies and the only mass considered is the sprung mass. This model holds well for
motions taking place at low frequency, in the range of the natural frequency of the
sprung mass (in most cases, up to 3–5 Hz, in the range deﬁned as ride by SAE).

The second model has two degrees of freedom. The tire is considered as a massless
spring, and both the unsprung and the sprung masses are considered. This model holds
well for frequencies up to the natural frequency of the unsprung mass and slightly
over (in most cases, up to 30–50 Hz, including the ranges ride, shake and partially
harshness).

The third model has three degrees of freedom. The tire is modelled as a spring-
mass-damper system, representing its dynamic characteristics in the lowest mode.
This model allows us to study motions taking place at frequencies in excess of the
ﬁrst natural frequency of the tires (up to 120–150 Hz, including then harshness).

If higher frequencies must be accounted for, it is possible to introduce a higher
number of tire modes by inserting other masses. These models, essentially based on
the modal analysis of the suspension-tire system, are clearly approximated because
a tire can be considered a damped system and one that is usually nonlinear.

26.4.1 Quarter-Car with a Single Degree of Freedom

Consider the simplest quarter-car model shown in Fig. 26.7a. It is a simple mass-
spring-damper system that, among other things, has been used in the past to demon-
strate that the shock absorber must be a linear, symmetrical viscous damper.7

The equation of motion of the system is simple. Using the symbols shown in the

ﬁgure it is

m ¨z + c˙z + K z = c ˙h + K h ,

where z (t) is the displacement from the static equilibrium position, referred to an
inertial frame, and h (t) is the vertical displacement of the supporting point due to
road irregularities.8

The frequency response of the quarter-car can be obtained simply by stating a

harmonic input of the type

The output is itself harmonic and can be expressed as

h = h0eiωt .

z = z0eiωt ,

where both amplitudes h0 and z0 are complex numbers to account for the different
phasing of response and excitation due to damping.

By introducing the time histories of the forcing function and the excitation into

the equation of motion, an algebraic equation is obtained:

(cid:8)
−ω2m + iωc + K

(cid:9)

z0 = (iωc + K ) h0 .

It links the amplitude of the response to that of the excitation, and yields

If h0 is real (that is, if the equation is written in phase with the excitation), the
real part of the response (the in-phase component of the response) can be separated
easily from its imaginary part (in-quadrature component)

More than the frequency response expressing the ratio between the amplitudes
of response and excitation, what matters in motor vehicle suspensions is the ratio
between the amplitudes of the acceleration of the sprung mass and that of the dis-
placement of the supporting point. Because in harmonic motion the amplitude of the
acceleration is equal to the amplitude of the displacement multiplied by the square
of the frequency, it follows that:

Both frequency responses are plotted in Fig. 26.8 for different values of the damp-
ing of the shock absorber, together with the phase (cid:4). The responses are plotted as

and damping is expressed as a function of the optimum damping deﬁned below.

All curves pass through point A, located at a frequency equal to

2K /m. Because
the acceleration of the sprung mass must be kept to a minimum to produce a comfort-
able ride, a reasonable way to optimize the suspension is to choose a value of shock
absorber damping that leads to a relative maximum, or at least a stationary point, at
point A on the curve related to acceleration. By differentiating the expression of

√

with respect to ω and equating the derivative to zero at point A, the following value
of the optimum damping is obtained:

is the critical damping of the suspension.

Although this method for optimizing the suspension can be readily criticized,
because the comfort of a suspension is far more complex than simple reduction of the
vertical acceleration (the so-called “jerk”, i.e., the derivative of the acceleration with
respect to time d 3z/dt 3 also plays an important role), it nonetheless gives important
indications.

Remark 26.3 Minimizing the vertical acceleration leads to minimizing the dynamic
component of the vertical load on the tire, which has a negative inﬂuence on the ability
of the tire to exert cornering forces. The condition leading to optimum comfort seems,
then, to coincide with that leading to optimum handling performance.

Equation (26.12) allows one to choose the value of the damping coefﬁcient c.
For the value of the stiffness K there is no such optimization: To minimize both the
acceleration and the dynamic component of the force, K should be kept as low as
possible. The only limit to the softness of the springs is the space available.

Remark 26.4 This reasoning has, however, the following limitation: The softer the
springs, the larger the oscillations of the sprung mass. Large displacements must be
avoided because they may cause large errors in the working angles of the tire, causing
the tires to work in conditions that may be far from optimal.

436

26 Comfort Performance

An empirical rule states that soft suspensions improve comfort while hard sus-
pensions improve handling. This is even more true if aerodynamic devices are used
to produce negative lift: suspensions allowing a large degree of travel cause major
changes of vehicle position with respect to the airﬂow, producing changes of the
aerodynamic force that are detrimental.

Moreover, at a ﬁxed value of the sprung mass, the lower the stiffness of the
spring, the lower the natural frequency. Very soft suspensions easily lead to natural
frequencies of about 1 Hz or even less, which may cause motion sickness and a
reduction in comfort that varies from person to person. Cars with soft suspensions
with large travel, typical of some manufacturers, are popular with some customers
but considered uncomfortable by others.

The optimum value of the damping expressed by Eq. (26.12) is lower than the
critical damping. The quarter-car is then underdamped and may undergo free oscilla-
tions, even if these generally damp out quickly because the damping ratio ζ = c/ccr

Compute the natural frequency of the suspension and its frequency response.
Assume that the vehicle travels at 30 m/s on a road that may be classiﬁed, following
ISO standards, at the limit between class B and class C, and compute the power
spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass and its root mean square
value. Assess the performance of the quarter car in these conditions.

where the frequency with respect to space is expressed in cycles/m and the power
spectral density in m2 /(cycles/m); constants c and n are

c = 1.28 × 10−6 m ,

n = −2

Computing the quantities referred to time from those referred to space at a speed

of 30 m/s, it follows that

S = c(cid:5)ωn

c(cid:5) = c

= 3.84 × 10−5 m3 s−2.

438

26 Comfort Performance

The power spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass can thus be
immediately computed by multiplying the square of the inertance by the power
spectral density of the road proﬁle, obtaining the result reported in Fig. 26.2. The
r.m.s. value of the acceleration can be computed by integrating the power spectral
density. The limits of integration referred to the space frequency are 0.01 and 10
cycles/m. By referring them to time, the frequency range extends from 0.3 to 300
Hz, obtaining

ar ms = 5.84 m/s2 = 0, 60 g.

This is a high value that causes reduced physical efﬁciency in less than 1 s at a
frequency between 1 and 2 Hz, where the resonance of the sprung mass is located.
This result should not surprise us, for the quarter car model has only one degree
of freedom and no tire. From the power spectral density it is clear that the largest
contribution to the integral is due to the range between 10 and 300 Hz, because
the response is still quite high even with increasing frequency. The computation,
performed by neglecting the ability of the tire to ﬁlter out the excitation at medium-
high frequency, has little meaning.

What the example shows is that the suspension alone is unable to ﬁlter out road

excitation, and that the presence of the tire is compulsory.

Because the quarter-car model is linear, the damper was assumed to be acting both
in the jounce and in the rebound stroke (double effect damper) and to be symmetrical
(having the same damping coefﬁcient for motion in both directions). Dampers used
in early automotive suspensions acted only in rebound and are today double effect,
but they are not symmetrical because the damping coefﬁcient in the jounce stroke is
much lower than in the rebound stroke.

To understand the advantages of symmetrical double-effect dampers,9 consider a
quarter-car with a single degree of freedom, passing at high speed over a bump or
pothole (Fig. 26.10). If the time needed to cross the road irregularity is far shorter
than the period of oscillation of the sprung mass (for instance, a bump 0.3 m long is
crossed in 0.01 s at a speed of 30 m/s), an impulsive model can be used to compute
the trajectory of the sprung mass. The effects of the perturbation to its motion can
be considered as a variation of the vertical component of the momentum applied
instantly. The trajectory of the sprung mass deviates by an angle α:

where w is the vertical component of the velocity. It can be computed using the
momentum theorem

The integral in Eq. (26.16) is the impulse of the forces due to the spring and to

The force due to the spring is the part exceeding the static value compensating for
the weight. If the integrals on the right-hand side of Eq. (26.17) vanish, the suspension
completely absorbs the irregularity, without any perturbation being transmitted to the
sprung mass. The ﬁrst of the two integrals is assumed to be far smaller than the second,
because in a small amplitude, high frequency disturbance the force due to the spring,
which is proportional to the displacement, is negligible compared to the force due
to the shock absorber, which is proportional to the velocity. By neglecting the ﬁrst
integral and assuming that the damper is symmetrical, the expression for the vertical
velocity becomes

(26.18)

where h(x) is the law expressing the road proﬁle.

From Eq. (26.18) it is clear that if h2 = h1 the suspension is able to insulate the
sprung mass perfectly from the road irregularity, a result that is due to the fact that
the damping coefﬁcient in rebound is equal to that in jounce.

This result, however, is compromised by the oversimpliﬁcation of the model.
It is well known that, while the shock absorber must act in both the up- and the
down-stroke, the damping coefﬁcients must be unequal for best performance. This
is easily explained by noting that while the instant value of the force due to the shock
absorber is larger than that due to the spring, the same inequality does not hold for
the integrals, particularly when the ﬁrst one vanishes. Another factor is that the road-
wheel constraint is unilateral. The disturbance when crossing a bump at high speed

440

26 Comfort Performance

is higher than when crossing over a hole. In the ﬁrst case, the force due to the spring
acts upwards; in the second a damping coefﬁcient higher in the downstroke gives a
negative value of the second integral of Eq. (26.17), which may compensate for the
positive value of the ﬁrst one. Some approximations are also linked to the use of the
impulsive model, particularly because if the unsprung mass and its natural frequency
are accounted for, the time needed to cross the obstacle is no longer much smaller
than the period of the free oscillations of the system.

Example 26.2 Consider the quarter-car with a single degree of freedom studied in
Example 26.1, crossing at a speed V = 30 m/s over an obstacle with harmonic proﬁle
similar to the usual obstacles (Fig. 26.11c). Let the proﬁle be

with h0 = 100 mm and a length (x2 − x1) of 300 mm. Because

Equation (26.7) was numerically integrated, with the results shown in Fig. 26.11a
in terms of displacements and in Fig. 26.11b in terms of velocity. The quarter-car
with symmetric damper (full line curve) succeeds well at ﬁltering out the obstacle,
with a maximum displacement of 6 mm. (6% of the displacement of the supporting
point). The plot of the velocity shows that the negative impulse in the second part of
the obstacle practically balances the positive impulse in the ﬁrst one.

The dashed line was computed by neglecting the contribution of the spring to the

impulse.

The dotted line was computed assuming that the damper has a coefﬁcient in the
jounce stroke equal to 80% of that in the rebound stroke. It is clear that the best
performance is obtained with a symmetric damper. This consideration is, however,
dependent on the extreme simpliﬁcation of the model. Among other simpliﬁcations,
the mono-lateral nature of the road-wheel contact has been neglected.

26.4.2 Quarter-Car with Two Degrees of Freedom

The following model is that shown in Fig. 26.7b. It is well suited for the study of the
behavior of vehicle suspensions in a frequency range beyond the natural frequency
of the unsprung mass.

The frequency responses related to both the sprung and the unsprung masses are

include curves obtained with different values of damping c; all curves lie in the
non-shaded region of the graph.

If c = 0 the natural frequencies are two and the peaks are inﬁnitely high. Also
for c → ∞ the peak, corresponding to the natural frequency of the whole system,
which is now rigid, over the spring simulating the tire, goes to inﬁnity.

The frequency responses of Fig. 26.12a, b multiplied by ω∗2 are shown in
Fig. 26.12c, d; they give the non-dimensional ratio between the accelerations of
the two masses and the displacement of the supporting point (suitably made non-
dimensional). All curves pass through points O, A, B and C. Between O and A
and between B and C the maximum acceleration of the sprung mass increases with
decreasing damping, while between A and B and from C upwards it increases with
damping.

An optimum value of damping can be found by trying to keep the acceleration as
low as possible in a large range extending up to the natural frequency of the unsprung
mass, i.e. by looking for a curve having a relative maximum or a stationary point in
A. Operating as seen with the previous model, the following value is obtained

frequency in Fig. 26.13. The value of the optimum damping expressed by Eq. (26.29)
is also effective in keeping the maximum value of the dynamic component of force Fz
as low as possible, at least at low frequencies. At higher frequencies, a slightly higher
value of damping could be effective, even if it would result in a larger acceleration
of the sprung mass.

The maximum value of the non-dimensional amplitude of force Fz has been
plotted as a function of ratio c/copt in Fig. 26.14a. When the damping goes beyond
the optimum value computed above, a certain decrease of the maximum amplitude
of the force at high frequency is clearly obtained.

The minimum value of the force on the ground (computed as the static component
minus the amplitude of the dynamic component) has been plotted as a function of
ratio c/copt in Fig. 26.14b, using data similar to those related to the front suspension
of a small car. The curves refer to different amplitudes of the excitation h0. If the
damping is small enough the wheel can bounce on the road. Clearly, when this occurs
the present linear model is no longer applicable.

dom. Power spectral density of the acceleration due to motion on a road at a speed of 30 m/s

By comparing the results of the two examples it is clear that the presence of the tire
is effective in ﬁltering out high frequency disturbances, while the transmissibility at
the natural frequency is slightly higher. At any rate, the r.m.s. value of the acceleration
is now acceptable, even if it is not optimal. From the plot of Fig. 26.4, it is clear that
this value causes reduced physical efﬁciency in 3 h; however, the driver and the
passengers are also insulated from vibration from the road by the seats.

Considering the integral between a wavelength of 0.1 and 100 m is practically
equivalent to considering the whole spectrum from 0 to inﬁnity, because the power
spectral density vanishes outside this range.

The computation has been repeated for various values of the speed and the results
are shown in Fig. 26.16. The r.m.s. value of the acceleration grows with increasing
speed.

From the considerations above it is possible to draw the conclusion that the value of
the damping coefﬁcient expressed in Eq. (26.29) is optimal both from the viewpoint of
comfort and of handling, because it leads to low variations in the forces on the ground.
A slightly higher damping may, however, somewhat improve handling because it
slightly reduces the variable component of the force on the ground.

This conclusion, obtained from a highly simpliﬁed model, is not in good accor-
dance with experimental evidence stating that the value of damping for optimizing
riding comfort is lower than that for optimizing handling.

To optimize the value of the damping coefﬁcient of the suspension it is possible to
consider motion on a road proﬁle of the type deﬁned by ISO 8606:1995 standard and
expressed by Eq. (26.1) with n = 2. An excitation of this type may be considered, as
already stated, as a white noise in terms of velocity, deﬁned in the frequency range
between 0.01 and 10 cycles/m.

Remark 26.5 The conditions leading to optimum comfort (in the sense of minimum
acceleration) and to optimum handling (in the sense of minimum force variations)
are readily identiﬁed: The ﬁrst is obtained with a damping lower than the optimum
damping deﬁned above, while the second for a damping value that is higher. This
result is in better accordance with experimental results than the previous one.

As already stated, the presence of the tires has a negligible effect on the fre-
quency response at low frequency, while at higher frequencies their stiffness must
be accounted for. A comparison between the results obtained using the quarter-car
models with one and two degrees of freedom is shown in Fig. 26.18.

to a particular quarter-car with two degrees of freedom moving at a speciﬁed speed.

car is simulated and the cumulative travel of the sprung mass with respect to the

the absolute value of the relative speed of the two masses divided by the vehicle

Fig. 26.19 Correlation between the road characteristics and the roughness index

The use of an index to deﬁne the quality of the road surface, one based on the
ratio between the total motion of the suspension and the distance travelled, dates
back to the 1940s. It is used at present by many international organizations. Since
1982 the World Bank has used it to compare road conditions in various countries. It
has been shown that a good correlation exists between the index and both the vertical
acceleration and the variation of the force on the ground; this property allows the
comfort and the performance on a given road to be understood.

26.4.4 Quarter-Car with Secondary Suspension

(Three Degrees of Freedom)

In many vehicles the suspensions are not assembled directly to the body, but are
mounted on a secondary frame, one that often carries other elements with a non-
negligible mass as well. This auxiliary frame is connected to the chassis with a

The response to a harmonic excitation can be computed as with previous models.

Example 26.4 Repeat the computations of the previous example assuming that a
secondary suspension is located between the sprung and unsprung masses. The data
are: sprung mass ms = 250 kg; mass of the auxiliary frame mt = 10 kg; unsprung mass
mu = 25 kg; stiffness of the spring K = 25 kN/m; stiffness of the spring of the auxiliary
suspension Kt = 100 kN/m; stiffness of the tire kt = 100 kN/m; damping coefﬁcient
of the damper c = 2,150 Ns/m; damping coefﬁcient of the auxiliary suspension ct =
5,000 Ns/m.

The values of the natural frequencies are

ω1 = 8.30 rad/s = 1.32 Hz
ω2 = 59.68 rad/s = 9.50 Hz
ω3 = 130.28 rad/s = 20.73 Hz.

The dynamic compliance H (ω) and the inertance ω2 H are plotted in Fig. 26.20,
along with the power spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass when
the vehicle travels at 30 m/s on a road deﬁned as in-between classes B and C ISO
8606: 1995.

The r.m.s. value of the acceleration is

ar ms = 1.21 m/s2 = 0.12 g.

The auxiliary suspension improves comfort slightly. By comparing the plots, how-
ever, it is clear that the improvement is concentrated in the medium-high frequency
range. If the comparison were done at a higher speed, in a condition in which high
frequency excitation were more signiﬁcant, the improvement would be larger.

26.4.5 Quarter-Car Model with Dynamic Vibration Absorber

A dynamic vibration absorber essentially consists of a mass connected to the system
through a spring and possibly a damper (Fig. 26.21a). If properly tuned, it can reduce
the amplitude substantially at one of the resonances of the original system, but it
introduces an additional resonance whose peak amplitude is controlled by the value
of its damping cd .

The frequency response of the system of Fig. 26.21a is shown in Fig. 26.21c for
three different values of damping: If cd is low, two resonance peaks are present, while
if cd is high, there is only one peak. If the damping tends to zero the two peaks have
an inﬁnite height, while if it tends to inﬁnity the system reduces to an undamped
system with a single degree of freedom and thus a single peak with inﬁnite height.
It is possible to demonstrate that the stiffness kd which reduces the amplitude of the
motion of mass m to a minimum is10

The various frequency responses may be obtained immediately as with the other
quarter-car models. Some results are reported in Fig. 26.22. Because no attempt has
been made to optimize the suspension, the ﬁgure has only a qualitative interest.

Curve 1 deals with a conventional quarter-car model as studied in the previous
section. Curves 2 and 3 refer to a system in which a vibration absorber is applied to the
kd /md = 0.89
unsprung mass, tuned on the ﬁrst and the second natural frequency (
kd /md = 7.09). The mass of the vibration absorber is 1/20 of the sprung mass
and
and the damping cd is 2

√

To add a vibration absorber to a conventional suspension changes its performance
only slightly, both in terms of acceleration of the sprung mass and of forces on the
ground. But vibration absorbers are interesting because of the possibility of using
them instead of conventional shock absorbers, as in the case shown by curve 4.

In the case shown, in which the values of the parameters were obtained by trial
and error without a true optimization, the acceleration of the sprung mass is quite low
in the entire frequency range, except for a strong resonance peak at low frequency.

26.4 Quarter-Car Models

Remark 26.7 The height of the peak is obviously limited, however, because some
damping is present, and in practice is further limited by the other forms of damping
present in the actual system, such as that due to the tire.

If the stiffness of the springs K is low, the peak occurs at very low frequency,
where its importance may be marginal, and the advantages of the vibration absorber,
primarily linked to lower cost and complexity of the system due to elimination of the
need for an element mounted between the body and the wheel, add to its excellent
suspension performance.

Dynamic vibration absorbers, used instead of conventional shock absorbers,
proved advantageous on several low cost small cars with soft suspensions; they may
also, however, be added to conventional luxury cars to further increase ride comfort.

26.4.6 Quarter-Car with Many Degrees of Freedom to Study

the Suspension-Tire Interaction

In the model of Fig. 26.7c, an additional degree of freedom has been included to
account for the compliance of the tire. To proceed in a more comprehensive way it
is possible to use the component mode synthesis approach, which is theoretically
applicable only if the tire is a linear elastic system, or at least a lightly damped but
nonetheless linear system.

The part of the system that may be considered a substructure can be identiﬁed.
When the system is discretized and the generalized coordinates are the displacements
of a certain number of points (the nodes), it is possible to subdivide the nodes into
two groups: the connection nodes, that are common to the substructure and to other
parts of the system, and the internal nodes. The vector of the generalized coordinates
and the stiffness matrix of the substructure may be accordingly partitioned

q =

K21 K22

(26.39)

where subscripts 1 and 2 refer respectively to the boundary and the internal degrees
of freedom. The other matrices (mass and damping matrices) may be partitioned in
the same way.

In the present case, if the tire is a substructure, the connection nodes are located
on the wheel rim and the internal nodes are all others. If the rim is a rigid body and,
as in the case of the quarter-car model, only the vertical displacement is considered,
the only generalized coordinate that is common to the tire and the other parts of the
system is displacement zu (q1 has just one element).

Consider the tire in its deformed conﬁguration under the static forces due to the
load applied to the suspension and linearize its behavior about this conﬁguration.
Neglecting the forces applied to the internal nodes in the static conﬁguration, vector
q2 is

456

26 Comfort Performance

q2 = K−1

22 K21q1 .

(26.40)

To express the dynamic deﬂected conﬁguration it is ideally possible to lock the
boundary nodes (in this case by constraining the rim of the wheel) and perform
dynamic analysis. The natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the tire are then
obtained by solving the eigenproblem related to matrices K22 and M22:

(cid:8)
−ω2M22 + K22

(cid:9)

det

= 0.

Once the eigenproblem has been solved, it is possible to use the eigenvector matrix

(cid:2) to perform the modal transformation

The generalized coordinates of the substructure can thus be expressed as

q2 = (cid:2)η

Equation (26.41) is a coordinate transform, allowing the deformation of the inter-
nal part of the substructure to be expressed in terms of constrained and internal
modes. Matrix (cid:4) expressing this transformation can be used to compute new mass,
stiffness and, if needed, damping matrices and a force vector

K∗ = (cid:4) T K (cid:4) , M∗ = (cid:4) T M(cid:4) , C∗ = (cid:4) T C(cid:4) , f ∗ = (cid:4) T f .

(26.42)

If the constrained coordinates are m (in the present case m = 1) and the internal
coordinates are n and only k modes of the constrained substructure are considered
(k < n), the size of the original M, K, etc. matrices is m + n, while that of matrices
M∗, K∗, etc. is m + k.

Remark 26.8 If all internal modes are considered (k = n) the method does not intro-
duce errors, but there is no simpliﬁcation. Both approximation and simpliﬁcation
increase while decreasing the number of modes considered.

The substructure so obtained can be easily assembled to the other parts of the sys-
tem. If, for instance, only one boundary degree of freedom (the vertical displacement
of the unsprung mass) and only one vibration mode of the tire are considered, the
quarter-car model has three degrees of freedom, two ‘physical’ ones (displacements
of the sprung and unsprung masses) plus a modal one.

Example 26.5 Consider the quarter-car model of the previous examples, taking into
account the inertia of the tire as well. A realistic model of the tire not being available,

by springs. b Dynamic model of a quarter-car with the tire simulated as in a). c and d Response of
the quarter-car model with three degrees of freedom based on the model in b)

consider it as made of a number of rigid rings, the ﬁrst being attached to the rim and the
last connected to the ground, connected to each other by linear springs and dampers
(Fig. 26.23a, where the rigid rings are 4). The dynamic model of the quarter-car is
shown in Fig. 26.23b.

Assume the following data: sprung mass ms = 250 kg; unsprung mass mu = 23
kg; masses of the 4 rings modelling the tire mi = 1 kg (i = 0,
..., 3), stiffness
of the suspension spring K = 25 kN/m; stiffness of the springs simulating the tire
ki = 300 kN/m (i = 0,
..., 3); damping coefﬁcient of the shock absorber c =
2,150 Ns/m; damping coefﬁcient of the dampers simulating the tire ci = 100 Ns/m
(i = 0, .. ., 3).

The values of ki were chosen so that, in static conditions, the stiffness of the tire
(that is, the stiffness of the three springs in series) is the same as in the previous
examples. A certain damping of the tire must be introduced in the present model;
otherwise, the response tends to inﬁnity at the resonance of the latter. The value

458

26 Comfort Performance

chosen is, however, low enough not to inﬂuence the results at other frequencies, and
it allows the tire to be studied with the assumption of small damping.

The dynamic compliance H (ω) and the inertance ω2 H are reported in Fig. 26.23

together with the power spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass.

The r.m.s. value of the acceleration is

ar ms = 1.36 m/s2 = 0.14 g.

The inertia of the tire has no major effect on the results, except in a narrow
frequency range about its natural frequency, where a small peak can be seen in

460

the frequency responses. The r.m.s. value of the acceleration is slightly higher and,
because of the presence of high frequency components, an auxiliary suspension may
be useful. Because of the approximate tire model here used, this example is simply
an indication of how the component modes synthesis approach can be used.

26.4.7 Effect of the Suspension Kinematics

In the previous cases the motion of the unsprung mass is only a vertical translation, as
if the suspension kinematism were a prismatic guide with axis parallel to the body-
ﬁxed z-axis. This model for an independent suspension is, however, quite rough,
because no actual suspension is made with a prismatic guide. Each type of suspension
has its own kinematics, or better elasto-kinematics because the various linkages are
rigid only as a ﬁrst approximation.

Usually the deviations of the trajectory of the unsprung mass from a straight
line parallel to the z-axis are considered shortcomings of the guiding kinematic
arrangement, as if straight motion were the ideal situation. But it is actually advisable,
on the contrary, that when the wheel gets a shock in the horizontal direction the
suspension allows it to move backwards, reducing the excitation in the x-direction
transferred to the vehicle body. Moreover, as seen in Part I and in a later section, only
by accepting that the wheel does not move exactly in the z-direction is it possible
to counteract the dive effects that occur when braking, and the lift (or squat) effects
found when driving.

The ﬁrst of these effects, the ability to absorb horizontal shocks, may be obtained
in two ways: by using a kinematic arrangement to produce a suitable trajectory, as
in the case of trailing arms (note that the opposite arrangements, which could be
deﬁned as leading arms, cause a forward displacement of the wheel when the latter
moves upwards and for this reason are seldom used today); or by giving a suitable
horizontal compliance to the suspension.

In the ﬁrst case, it is still possible to use the quarter-car model, while in the second
the model must include a further degree of freedom for each wheel, namely horizontal
displacement.

While a knowledge of the exact elasto-kinematics of the suspension is essential
for stating the position of the wheel with respect to the ground and thus for assessing
contact forces, its actual effect on the inertial forces acting on the elements of the
suspension and on the forces due to the spring and the shock absorber is limited. Thus
it is possible to neglect the compliance of the guiding elements and proceed to a ﬁrst
approximation study related to comfort by using models based on the quarter-car
approach.

It is possible to deﬁne the trajectories of points G, M and A (Fig. 26.24), i.e. of
the center of mass of the unsprung mass and the attachment points of the spring
and of the shock absorber in a reference frame x1 y1z1 ﬁxed to the sprung mass. The
trajectory of a generic point P of the unsprung mass is

The motion of the unsprung mass occurs mostly in the z1 direction, and thus
it is expedient to transform Equations (26.43) by solving them in x1 and y1. The

ing coordinate z1P of point P as a function of the coordinate z1G of the center of mass

(26.65)

As far as the elastic and damping terms are concerned, the linearized equation of
motion is still Eq. (26.22), except for the values of the stiffness of the spring or the
damping coefﬁcient of the shock absorber which are reduced through coefﬁcients γ
and δ. The mass matrix is, on the other hand, different, because it is not diagonal.
An inertial coupling proportional to the value of the unsprung mass is then present.
It will cause a larger motion of the sprung mass at frequency ranges typical of the
motion of the unsprung mass.

In any case, the quarter-car model assumes that the sprung mass moves along the z
direction, an approximation that is increasingly unrealistic with increasing coupling
of horizontal and vertical motion of the unsprung mass due to the kinematics of the
suspension. In particular, a motion of the sprung mass in the x direction due to a
motion in the z direction may be detrimental to comfort, and cannot be studied using

together with the power spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass.

The r.m.s. value of the acceleration is

ar ms = 1.34 m/s2 = 0.14 g.

By comparing the plot with that obtained for the simple two degrees of freedom
quarter-car model, it will be noted that the peak of the response is higher, and also
that the response is in general higher at frequencies close to the resonances of both
sprung and unsprung masses. At higher frequencies the response is lower, primarily
because the inertia is in some way increased by the coupling of longitudinal and
vertical motion, causing the suspension to behave as if it were softer. The reduction
of the r.m.s. value of the acceleration is, however, minimal.

26.5 Heave and Pitch Motion

26.5.1 Simpliﬁed Models with Rigid Tires

The heave motion of the vehicle is strictly coupled with pitch motion. The simplest
model for studying the heave-pitch coupling is shown in Fig. 26.27a. Its equation of

Fig. 26.27 Beam models for heave and pitch motions

The overturning moment due to weight (term −m S gh to be added in position 22 in
the stiffness matrix) is not included in Eq. (26.66), because no assumption has been
made on the height of the pitch center over the road plane. Nor is any aerodynamic
term introduced into the equation of motion. The longitudinal position of the springs
and the shock absorbers has been assumed to be the same.

The forcing functions were written in a form that considers only the vertical motion
of points A and B, neglecting horizontal forces at the ground-wheels interface and
the possible coupling between vertical and horizontal motions due to suspensions.
If mass ms and moment of inertia Jy are those of the whole sprung mass, the
stiffnesses Ki and the damping coefﬁcients ci are those of a whole axle and are then
twice those of a single spring or shock absorber.

The compliance of the tires was neglected in the beam model shown in Fig. 26.27a.
It may thus be considered an evolution of the quarter-car with a single degree of
freedom. In some cases it can be reduced to a pair of quarter-cars, as shown in
Fig. 26.27b. To compare the two models, it is possible to use the coordinates Z A
and Z B instead of Zs and θ to describe the motion of the beam. The coordinate
transformation may be expressed as:

This condition is usually not veriﬁed in practice. The tendency to increase the
wheelbase for stability reasons leads to values of the dynamic index usually smaller

The solution with (+) sign yields two positive values, that generally are not equal
to each other. The motion of the beam is neither a rotation about its center of mass
(pitch) nor a translational motion in the z direction (heave), but the very fact that the
displacements at the front and rear axles have the same sign means that the node (the
point with zero displacement) lies outside of the wheelbase, and thus the motion is
primarily translational (heave, Fig. 26.28a). The solution with (−) sign (Fig. 26.28b)
yields a positive and a negative value: the displacements of the front and rear axles
are one positive and one negative and the node is within the wheelbase. The motion
is primarily rotational, even if not about the center of mass, and it is primarily a
pitching motion.

and the free oscillations of the sprung mass are rotations about the points where the
suspensions are connected to the body. It is impossible to identify a heave and a
pitch mode; it is more accurate to speak about a front-axle and a rear-axle mode. The
limiting case is where the node internal to the wheelbase and that external to it tend
to the ends of the wheelbase.

The other limiting case (Fig. 26.28e, f) is when

a K1 = bK2.

(26.75)

From Eq. (26.66) without damping terms it is clear that the two equations of
motion uncouple: the heave motion uncouples from the pitch motion. The ﬁrst is
translational, while the second is rotational and occurs about the center of mass. The
natural frequencies are then

The two limiting cases may also occur simultaneously. From Eq. (26.76) it follows

that when this is the case the two natural frequencies have the same value.

472

26 Comfort Performance

Remark 26.9 This solves an apparent inconsistency; if

a K1 = bK2,

the centers of rotation are one in the centre of mass (pitch mode) and one at inﬁnity
(heave mode), while when the dynamic index has a unit value they are at the end
of the wheelbase. When both conditions occur simultaneously, the two natural fre-
quencies coincide; in this case, any linear combination of the eigenvectors is itself an
eigenvector. Thus in the case of a rigid beam, any point of the beam (or better, of the
straight line constituting the beam axis) may be considered as a center of rotation.

Example 26.7 Consider a vehicle having the following characteristic: sprung mass
ms = 1, 080 kg; pitching moment of inertia Jy = 1,480 kg m2; stiffness of the
suspensions (referred to the axles) K1 = 45 kN/m; K2 = 38 kN/m; a = 1.064 m;
b = 1.596 m, (l = 2.66 m). Study the pitching oscillations of the vehicle, using a
beam model.

(26.78)

The two natural frequencies of the independent quarter-car models are

ω1 = 1.33 Hz , ω2 = 1.49 Hz .

(26.79)

Because the dynamic index is different from 1, the approximation so obtained is
a rough one. By solving the characteristic equation, the correct natural frequencies
are obtained

ω1 = 1.36 Hz , ω2 = 1.62 Hz .

The node of the ﬁrst mode lies within the wheelbase and, because it is 2.015 m

The node of the second mode, a heave mode, is in front of the vehicle, 2.09 m from
the front axle.

26.5 Heave and Pitch Motion

26.5.2 Pitch Center

No guiding linkage is considered in the model of Fig. 26.27a, but it is implicitly
assumed that the connection points of the suspension to the body may move only in a
vertical direction. The wheelbase of the vehicle is then not affected either by bounce
or pitch motion. Moreover, it is assumed that the inertia of the unsprung masses does
not affect the motion of the body.

It is, in any caser, possible to ﬁnd a point along the x-axis such that a vertical
force applied to it produces a vertical motion but no pitching. This point is the pitch
center.

To deﬁne the position of the pitch center, a static force F can be applied to the
body in a vertical direction at a point on the x-axis at a generic distance d from the
center of mass. Equation (26.66) becomes

.

Solving for the pitch angle θ , it follows that

θ = a K1 − bK2 − d (K1 + K2)

.

K1 K2l 2

Equating the numerator to zero, it follows that if

d = a K1 − bK2
K1 + K2

angle θ vanishes. This value of d is the distance in the x direction of the pitch center
from the center of mass; it is positive if the pitch center is forward of the mass center.
In the majority of cases, d is positive. If Eq. (26.75) holds, d = 0 and the mass center
is above or below the mass center.

The presence of kinematic guides for suspensions does not change things:
Eq. (26.66) still holds, even if the meaning of the terms may vary. Consider, for
instance, a vehicle with longitudinal swing arm suspensions and springs located
below the ﬂoor. Linearize the equations of motion about a reference position
(Fig. 26.29).

Assume that the suspended mass moves vertically by a distance (cid:13)z and rotates

in pitch by an angle θ . Points A and B move vertically by

(cid:17)

(cid:13)z A = (cid:13)z − cθ
(cid:13)z B = (cid:13)z + dθ .

As clearly seen, the structure of the stiffness matrix is identical to the general
case, even if it includes terms that are typical of the particular type of suspension.
The damping matrix may be obtained along the same lines.

The suspension type also affects the mass matrix to be introduced into Eq. (26.66),
because heave and pitch motions also cause some movements of the unsprung masses,
causing their inertial parameters to enter the mass matrix as well.

The height of the pitch center becomes important when the wheels exert longitu-
dinal forces, because the coupling between driving (or braking) and pitching depend
on it. The antidive and antilift (or antisquat) characteristics of the suspensions also
depend on the height of the pitch center.

If the wheels do not exert longitudinal forces, the pitch center is assumed to lie
roughly at the height of the centers of the wheels, which amounts to assuming that
the wheels travel at constant speed even when the body oscillates in heave or pitch.11

26.5.3 Empirical Rules for the Design of Suspensions

As already stated, the bounce and pitch dynamics of the suspended mass are strictly
related to each other. Some empirical criteria for the choice of the relevant parameters
are here reported: They date back to the 1930s and were introduced by Maurice
Olley.12

• The vertical stiffness of the front suspension must be about 30% lower than that

of the rear suspension;

• The pitch and bounce frequencies must be close to each other; the bounce frequency

should be less than 1.2 times the pitch frequency;
• Neither frequency should be greater than 1.3 Hz;
• The roll frequency should be approximately equal to the bounce and pitch fre-

quency.

Edmunds, 2002.

26 Comfort Performance

The ﬁrst rule states that the natural frequency of the rear suspension is higher than
that of the front, at least if the weight distribution is not such that the rear wheels
are far more loaded than those in front. The importance of having a lower natural
frequency for the front suspension may be explained by observing that any road input
reaches the front suspension ﬁrst and then, only after a certain time, the rear one. If
the natural frequency of the latter is higher, when the vehicle rides over a bump the
rear part quickly “catches up” to the motion of the front and, after the ﬁrst oscillation,
the body of the vehicle moves in bounce rather than pitch, a favorable factor for ride
comfort. Then the rear part of the vehicle should lead the motion, but by that time
damping has caused the amplitude to decrease.

The second rule is easily fulﬁlled in modern cars. The problem here may be that
of having the pitch frequency much higher than the bounce one, and higher than 1.3
Hz (third rule), as may happen when the dynamic index is smaller than unity (vehicle
with long wheelbase and small front/rear overhang). Generally speaking, a dynamic
index close to unity is considered a desirable condition for good ride properties,
while a complete bounce-ride uncoupling as occurs when a K1 = bK2 is considered
a nuisance. Coupling between bounce and pitching is good as it tends to avoid strong
pitch oscillations.

The fourth rule has nothing to do with pitch motion, and will be discussed later.

Example 26.8 Check whether the vehicle studied in the previous example complies
with the criteria deﬁned by Olley. Study the response of the vehicle when crossing
a road irregularity at a speed of 100 km/h = 27.8 m/s by using an impulsive model,
assuming that the impulse given by the irregularity ﬁrst to the front axle and then to
the rear axle has a unit value.

To study the motion of the body after crossing the irregularity, assume that both
suspensions are damped with a damping coefﬁcient equal to the optimum value
computed using a quarter-car model with a single degree of freedom.

The natural frequencies of the suspensions, computed using the model with two
independent quarter-cars, are 1.33 (front axle) and 1.49 Hz (rear axle). The second
is higher than the ﬁrst by about 12%. By considering that the natural frequencies
are proportional to the square root of the stiffness, this corresponds to a stiffness of
the rear axle 24% greater than that of the front, a value not much different from the
suggested 30%.

Because the dynamic index has no unit value (Id = 0.807), the model made by
two quarter-cars is not accurate. If the system is considered as a coupled system,
the frequencies for bounce and pitch motions are 1.36 and 1.62 Hz, which does
not coincide with those previously computed (the ﬁrst is not much different, while
the second is greater by about 8%). The ﬁrst is smaller than 1.2 times the second
(actually smaller than that) and the frequencies are relatively similar. However, the
natural frequency in pitch is greater than 1.3 Hz, and is higher than what has been
suggested, even if not by much.

The values of the damping of the shock absorbers, computed using the quarter-car

model with a single degree of freedom, are

The delay between the instant the front axle is excited and that when the rear axle

is on the irregularity is, at 100 km/h,

(26.90)

To compute the response of the model made by two independent quarter-car
models to a unit impulse, it is enough to compute the free responses of the two
systems with the initial conditions due to the impulse. The front suspension will start
with the initial conditions

(z A)

In the same way, the initial conditions for the rear suspension are

(z B)

(˙z B)
0

for t = τ .

(26.92)

The result is reported in Fig. 26.30a in terms of time histories. The vertical dis-
placement at the center of mass and the pitch angle may be computed through Eq.
(26.67) from the displacements of the points where the suspensions are attached. The
result is plotted in Fig. 26.30b, dashed curves. Because the natural frequency of the
rear axle is greater than that of the front axle, the two masses move synchronously
after a single oscillation is completed: pitch motions extinguish faster than bounce.
To avoid the approximations due to the model with two independent quarter-
cars, it is possible to numerically integrate the system’s equations of free motion
(homogeneous equation associated to Eq. (26.66)) in two distinct intervals of time,
between t = 0 and t = τ and after t = τ . In the ﬁrst interval the initial conditions
are those following the ﬁrst impulse.

The errors due to the model made by two independent quarter-cars are small, even
if the dynamic index is smaller than 1.

26.5.4 Frequency Response of the Model with Two Degrees

of Freedom

If, when using the quarter-car model road, roughness excites only bounce motions,
in a complete vehicle it excites both bounce and pitching motions, as already seen.
Neglecting roll, it is possible to use a model of the type seen in Fig. 26.27a, assuming
that laws h A (t) and h B (t) are identical, except for the fact that the second is delayed
with respect to the ﬁrst by time

τ = l

needed to travel a distance equal to the wheelbase. To compute the frequency response
of the vehicle, the forcing functions to be introduced into Eq. (26.68) are then

(cid:17)

h A = ho sin(ωt)
h B = ho sin[ω(t + τ )] = ho[sin(ωt) cos(ωτ ) + cos(ωt) sin(ωτ )] .

(26.96)

Term ωτ is proportional to the ratio between the wheelbase l of the vehicle and
the wavelength of road irregularities λ. The frequency ω related to space instead of
time is linked with the wavelength by the relationship

and to the frequency related to time by the relationship

λ = 2π
ω

ω =

ω

V

.

It follows then that

ωτ =

ωl
V

= 2π l
λ .

At low frequency, the excitation at the two axles occurs almost in phase, with the
result that pitch motions are little excited. In a similar way, if l is a whole multiple
of the wavelength λ (the wavelength is equal to the wheelbase or to one of its whole
sub-multiples), ωτ is a whole multiple of 2π and then cos(ωτ ) = 1 and sin(ωτ ) = 0.
The two axles are excited in phase: if the equations of motion were uncoupled and
the center of mass were at mid-wheelbase, only bounce motion would be excited and
no pitching would occur. Although this is not exactly true due to coupling, the result
is that the vehicle pitches much less than it bounces.

If, on the contrary, l is an odd multiple of λ/2 (the wavelength of the irregularities
is twice the wheelbase or is a whole multiple of twice the wheelbase), it follows that
cos(ωτ ) = −1 and sin(ωτ ) = 0, and the two axles are excited with 180◦ phasing.
In this case, if the center of mass were at mid-wheelbase and the system uncoupled,
no bouncing would occur and the vehicle would only pitch. This consideration holds
qualitatively for actual cases.

This phenomenon, usually referred to as wheelbase ﬁltering, introduces a depen-
dence between the response of the system and speed. If, for instance, the wheelbase
is 2 m and the speed is 20 m/s, the delay τ is 0,1 s. The maximum pitch response,
with a very low bounce, occurs when the irregularities have a wavelength equal to
twice the wheelbase or one of the odd submultiples of twice the wheelbase, that is
4, 4/3, 4/5, …m. At 20 m/s, the corresponding frequencies at which bounce motions
are minimal are 5, 15, 25, …Hz. In the same way, the maximum bounce motions
with little pitching occur at wavelengths equal to the wheelbase and its whole sub-
multiples, 2, 1, 0,5, …m. At a speed of 20 m/s, the corresponding frequencies are

480

26 Comfort Performance

10, 20, 30, …Hz. Moreover, little pitch excitation occurs at very low frequency, as
already stated, and as a consequence pitch excitation is minimal in highway driving.
The situation may be different for industrial vehicles owing to the larger wheelbase
and lower speed coupled with high spring stiffness: wheelbase ﬁltering may lead to
strong pitch response, accompanied by low bounce. The effect is further worsened by
the fact that in tall vehicles pitch excitation causes longitudinal oscillation in points
above the center of mass that may prove quite inconvenient.
In general, the expression of the excitation vector is

Functions fi (ωτ ) and gi (ωτ ) may be considered as ﬁlters that, applied to the sine
and cosine components of the excitation due to the road proﬁle, yield the bounce and
pitch excitation. However, because of coupling between the equations of motion, all
terms of the excitation contribute to both bouncing and pitching.

To obtain a ﬁrst approximation evaluation of the effect of wheelbase ﬁltering,
assume that the equations of motion are uncoupled (a K1 = bK2 and bc2 = ac1) and
that the center of mass is at mid wheelbase (a = b). To comply with both these
conditions the front and rear suspensions must have the same elastic and damping
characteristics (K1 = K2 and c2 = c1).

actual value of the parameters

are slight, but they may be a nuisance in points located a greater distance from it.
Bounce—pitch coupling due to suspensions may severely reduce riding comfort.

Example 26.9 Compute functions fi (ωτ ) and gi (ωτ ) for the vehicle of the previous
examples at a speed of 100 km/h = 27.8 m/s and plot the frequency responses for
bounce and pitch oscillations.

The computation will be performed initially using a ﬁrst approximation model
(uncoupling between bounce and pitch and unit dynamic index), and then factoring
in the actual value of the parameters.

To uncouple the equations, the actual values of a and b are substituted by l/2
and those of K1, K2, c1 and c2 by the mean values of the stiffnesses and damping
coefﬁcients. Morover, Jy is assumed to be equal to mab.

The results are plotted in Fig. 26.32a, b. As expected, at vanishing frequency

pitching response vanishes and only bounce is present. If l is an odd multiple of λ/2
(ω = 5.22 Hz, ω = 15.66 Hz, ... ) the bounce response vanishes and only pitch is
present.

The results obtained from the actual values of the parameters are shown in
Fig. 26.32c, d. As is clear from the ﬁgure, the results differ from those obtained

484

26 Comfort Performance

by uncoupling the equations, but the difference is not large. In particular, the bounce
response never vanishes, even if at about 5 and 15 Hz it becomes quite small.

It must be noted that the model with stiff tires used here should not be used for

frequencies higher than 4–6 Hz.

26.5.5 Effect of Tire Compliance

If the compliance of tires is accounted for, the model must contain also the unsprung
masses. The minimum number of degrees of freedom needed to study bounce and
pitch motions is four (Fig. 26.33a). If the dynamic index has a unit value, the model
of Fig. 26.33a may be substituted by that of Fig. 26.33b.

Remembering that the excitation due to the vertical motion of points A and B can

be expressed by Eq. (26.96), the equation of motion can be written in the form

The results obtained using the model with two degrees of freedom are reported
in Fig. 26.34a, b, while those obtained using the model of four degrees of freedom
are reported in Fig. 26.34c, d. The values of the natural frequencies of the undamped
system are 1.25, 1.51, 10.61 e 10.74 Hz, while those of the simpliﬁed model are
1.36 e 1.62 Hz.

At low frequency the results obtained from the two models are similar, while at
frequencies higher than those of the unsprung masses the ﬁltering effect of the tires
reduces the amplitude of the response.

26.5.6 Interconnected Suspensions

If the value of the pitch natural frequency is too high when compared with that of the
bounce motions, ride comfort may be affected. To control the natural frequencies of
pitch and bounce independently, without changing the wheel positions and the inertial
properties of the body, the suspensions can be interconnected. Pitching frequencies
can be raised without increasing those in bounce if the front and rear wheels are
connected by a spring opposing pitching motions, similar to the anti-roll bars used
for rolling motions. This is however the opposite of what is usually needed and,
moreover, has the effect of decreasing the damping of pitch.

Various types of mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic interconnections may be
used, the latter particularly in the presence of air or hydraulic springs. A mechanical
solution is shown in Fig. 26.35a. The vehicle is based on longitudinal swing arm
suspensions, with springs located longitudinally under the sprung mass. The springs
are connected to a further element, itself elastically connected to the vehicle body.

The system is functionally similar (even if simpler) to the model shown in Fig. 26.35b,
in which the intermediate element is a beam, hinged to the vehicle body and connected
to the unsprung masses through springs. The tires are considered here as rigid bodies
and have not been included in the model.

If the beam and springs with stiffness χ1 and χ2 were not included, the equa-
tion of motion would have been Eq. (26.66), without the damping matrix, as in the
ﬁgure, if damping is neglected. If the inertia of the beam is neglected, no further
degree of freedom is needed, because the position of the beam is determined by the
displacement z and the rotation θ of the sprung mass. The stiffness matrix may be
obtained simply by adding the potential energy of springs χ1 and χ2 and performing
the relevant derivatives.

The positions of points P and Q are simply

(cid:17)

z P = z + cθ − l1γ
z Q = z + cθ + l2γ ,

(26.114)

where γ is the angle between line PQ and the horizontal and all relevant angles are
assumed to be small.

From Eq. (26.118) it is clear that the terms due to the interconnection between front
and rear suspensions affect in a different way the various elements of the stiffness
matrix and allow us to modify independently the values of the bounce and pitch
natural frequencies, possibly lowering the latter without affecting the former.

26.6 Roll Motion

26.6.1 Model with a Single Degree of Freedom

As already stated, rollis coupled with handling and not with ride comfort. However
it is also true that rolling can affect strongly the subjective feeling of riding comfort.
The simplest model for studying roll motion is a rigid body, simulating the sprung
mass, free to rotate about the roll axis, constrained to the ground by a set of springs and
damper with a stiffness and a damping coefﬁcient equal to those of the suspensions
(Fig. 26.36). If Jx , ms, χi and (cid:19)i are respectively the moment of inertia about the roll
axis, the sprung mass, the torsional stiffness and the damping coefﬁcient of the ith
suspension, the equation of motion is

¨φ + ((cid:19)1 + (cid:19)2) ˙φ + (χ1 + χ2) φ − ms ghG sin (φ) =

Jx

(26.119)

= (cid:19)1 ˙αt1

+ (cid:19)2 ˙αt2

+ χ1αt1

+ χ2αt2

,

where the forcing functions are those due to the transversal inclination of the road
αti at the ith suspension.

The inertia of the unsprung masses and the compliance of the tires are not included
in such a simple model, which is formally identical to the quarter-car with a single
degree of freedom.

For small values of the roll angle, the model may be linearized, stating sin (φ) ≈ φ.

The roll natural frequency is then

This condition is generally not satisﬁed, particularly if the vehicle has anti-roll
bars. The torsional damping of the suspensions is supplied by the same shock
absorbers normally designed to optimize vertical motion; the roll damping they
supply is usually lower than needed. The increase in stiffness due to anti-roll bars
is not accompanied by an increase in damping. The effect causes a decrease of the
damping ratio, together with an increase of the natural frequency.

The stiffer the suspension in torsion, the more underdamped the roll behavior, if
the increase in stiffness is due to anti-roll bars. Although reducing rolling in stationary
conditions, they may increase it in dynamic conditions. An overelongation in the step
response, as when roll is due to a moment abruptly applied (steering step input, wind
gusts or other similar instances), may then result. A large roll in dynamic conditions
may cause rollover.

The importance of a center of mass not too high on the roll axis and stiff suspen-
sions (in roll) is then clear. The last condition contradicts the need for a small roll in
dynamic conditions.

Example 26.11 Consider the vehicle studied in Example 26.7, and assume that the
moment of inertia Jx is equal to 388.8 kg m2 and the sprung mass is 1,080 kg. Compute
the time history of the roll angle when the vehicle encounters a ramp leading from
a horizontal road to a transversal slope αt = 5◦ in a distance of 10 m at a speed of
30 m/s.

Other data: stiffnesses of the axles K1 = 45 kN/m, K2 = 38 kN/m, damping of
the axles c1 = 3, 820 Ns/m, c2 = 2, 865 Ns/m, distance of the springs and dampers
from the symmetry plane d = 0.5 m, wheelbase l = 2.66 m. Repeat the computation,
adding an anti-roll bar at the front axle, with a stiffness χb = 4, 000 Nm/rad.

Computation without anti-roll bar.
The stiffnesses and damping coefﬁcients of the axles can be computed using

formulae of the type

χi = Ki d 2

It then follows that: χ1 = 11.25 kNm/rad, χ2 = 9.5 kNm/rad, (cid:19)1 = 955 Nms/rad,
(cid:19)2 = 716 Nms/rad. The total roll damping (cid:19)1 + (cid:19)2 = 1.671 Nms/rad is then smaller
than the optimum damping computed by neglecting the gravitational effect (2.008
Nms/rad), while only slightly smaller than that computed by taking it into account
(1.733 Nsm/rad).

The roll natural frequencies are then ω = 1.00 Hz (gravitational effect included)

Computation with anti-roll bar.
The computation is then repeated after adding the stiffness of the anti-roll bar to

that of the suspensions. The roll natural frequency is now ω = 1.13 Hz.

The results are reported in non-dimensional form in Fig. 26.37. Results obtained
with both the actual and the optimum damping are reported for the case without
anti-roll bar. In this case, the actual damping is smaller than the optimum and the
difference between the two results is small.

As expected, the steady state inclination of the body coincides with the transversal
slope of the road, if the effect of the weight is neglected. If weight is accounted for,
the ﬁnal inclination of the body is greater. The nonlinear model has been integrated
numerically to check whether the results obtained are realistic: owing to the low
values of the angles, the difference between the linearized and the nonlinear results
is negligible.

If an anti-roll bar is present the whole curve decreases, when the effect of weight is
taken into account. If the latter is neglected, the effect of the anti-roll bar is minimal.

26.6.2 Model with Many Degrees of Freedom

A simple model with three degrees of freedom may be used to take rolling of unsprung
masses and compliance of the tires into account. The unsprung masses are modelled
as rigid bodies free to rotate about the roll axis of the vehicle. It is clear that this
model is a rough approximation, particularly if independent suspensions are used.
This further approximation, however, does not worsen matters, because the largest
errors come from studying roll motion without taking into account that they are
coupled with handling motions.

Equation (26.127) can be solved numerically and allows the natural frequencies

of roll oscillations to be computed.

To drastically simplify the model, the moment of inertia of the unsprung masses
and the damping of the tires can be neglected. The equations of motion are thus a set
of one second-order equation plus two ﬁrst-order ones. The state space equation so

are reported in Fig. 26.38 in nondimensional form.

As is clear from the ﬁgure, the effect of the compliance of the tire is not large.

26.7 Effect of Nonlinearities

493

26.7 Effect of Nonlinearities

26.7.1 Shock Absorbers

As previously stated, shock absorbers are far from being linear viscous dampers. In
fact, most automotive shock absorbers are unsymmetrical, with a damping which
is larger in the rebound stroke. Apart from the nonlinearities in the behavior of
the shock absorbers and those due to the geometry of the suspension, along with
asymmetries purposely built in, other unwanted nonlinear effects, such as dry friction,
are often present. Particular care must be devoted to the effects of lateral loads
in McPherson suspensions, due to a more or less pronounced dependence of the
characteristics on temperature and cavitation. The latter phenomenon is primarily
felt at high temperature, and consists in the vaporization of the ﬂuid or the expansion
of the gasses dissolved in it.

Moreover, even in cases where shock absorbers are assumed to act in the same
direction as other forces, some deviations may occur in practice, introducing further
nonlinearities that should be accounted for.

By neglecting the inertia of moving elements and temperature variations, the
force exerted by a shock absorber may be considered as a function of both relative
displacement and relative velocity of its endpoints:

F = F (z, ˙z) .

(26.129)

The experimental results are often reported in the form of a force-displacement
plot (Fig. 26.39a). If the force were proportional to velocity (viscous damping) the
plot obtained in harmonic motion conditions would be an ellipse, with a ratio between
its axes proportional to the frequency. If the characteristics were linear but unsym-
metrical (i.e., bilinear) the plot would be made by two semi-ellipses, one above (the
smallest) and one below (the largest) the abscissa’s axis.

The force-speed plot (characteristic plot) of the same shock absorber is reported
in Fig. 26.39b. If no cavitation occurs, the force depends only on the speed, i.e.,
the intersections of the surface (26.129) with planes with ˙z constant are horizontal
straight lines, and the characteristic diagram is unique. In this case, force F depends
only on ˙z and may be written as the sum of a linear characteristic (viscous damping),
an odd function fo (˙z) and an even function fe (˙z) of the speed ˙z13

F = −c ˙z − fe (˙z) − fo (˙z) .

(26.130)

The two functions are, respectively, the deviation from symmetry and the deviation

from linearity.

instead of the displacement z, obtaining

m ¨zr + c˙zr + K zr + fe ˙zr + fo ˙zr = −m ¨h .

(26.133)

Because the system is nonlinear, the response will be a generic periodic but non-
harmonic law even if the forcing function is harmonic. It may, at any rate, be expressed
by a Fourier series

where all harmonics, including that of order 0, may be present, because the nonlinear
function contains both even and odd terms. If the nonlinearities are not too strong, a
ﬁrst approximation solution may be obtained by truncating the series after the term
with i = 1. Working in phase with the response and not with the excitation, it is
possible to write

(cid:17)

h = h0 sin (ωt − φ)

It is then possible to demonstrate that the even function (deviation from symmetry)
causes a displacement of the center of oscillation from the static equilibrium position,
but has little effect on the dynamic response of the system. If the deviation from
symmetry is neglected, the characteristics of the shock absorber can be linearized in
the origin, and it is possible to use the equivalent linear viscous damping to study the
small oscillations of the system. This explains why linearized models may be used
even when the effect of nonlinearities seems to be important. This holds true even
for small oscillations.

Example 26.13 Consider a quarter-car with two degrees of freedom with the param-
eters typical of the suspension of a small car: ms = 240 kg, mu = 25 kg, K =
20, 8 kN/m, P = 125 kN/m. Assume that the shock absorber is nonlinear and asym-

The results for a forcing function with an amplitude of 100 mm are reported
in Fig. 26.42a. It is clear that the amplitude of the motion of both the sprung and
unsprung masses (in terms of zs and zu and not of z1 and z2) obtained using numerical
integration and the approximated nonlinear computations are close to each other.
Moreover, the amplitude of the motion almost coincides with that obtained from the
linearized model, with the difference that in this case there is a displacement of the
central position of the oscillation.

The results obtained for an amplitude of the forcing function of 10 mm are shown
in Fig. 26.42b. In this case, there is some difference between the linearized and the
nonlinear solution at low frequency, due to dry friction that locks the suspension in
this condition. In general, however, the accuracy of the linearized model is conﬁrmed.

26.7.2 Springs

Dry friction in leaf springs introduces hysteresis and an apparent increase of stiffness
in low amplitude motion. A qualitative force-deﬂection characteristic of a leaf spring
is shown in Fig. 26.43. The hysteresis cycle is readily visible. The overall elastic
behavior is practically linear, with a hysteresis cycle occurring about the straight line
representing the average stiffness. If small amplitude oscillations occur about the
equilibrium position, the apparent stiffness is strongly dependent on the amplitude,
with a value tending to inﬁnity when the amplitude tends to zero. This behavior is
typical of dry friction that causes the spring to lock when very small movements are

Fig. 26.43 Load-deﬂection characteristics of a leaf spring exhibiting hysteretic behavior. The hys-
teresis cycle for small displacements about the equilibrium position is shown

required. The stiffness for the small oscillations typical of ride behavior can then be
much larger than the overall stiffness of the spring.

The presence of dry friction makes linear models inapplicable, or at least makes
their results inaccurate, and causes a deterioration of the ride qualities of the suspen-
sion.

Other nonlinearities may be introduced by nonlinear springs, which are sometimes
used for industrial vehicles in order to avoid large variations of the natural frequencies
with the load. Air springs are also widely used on industrial vehicles, and their
characteristics are strongly nonlinear. However, nonlinearities of the behavior of the
springs can be dealt with in the same way as those due to the kinematics of the
suspensions and, in the motion about any equilibrium condition, a linearized study
holds with good approximation.

26.8 Concluding Remarks on RIDE Comfort

The linearized study of suspension motions, based primarily on quarter-car models,
shows that the value of shock absorber damping for optimizing comfort is the same
as that for reducing the dynamic component of the force on the ground to a minimum,
and hence optimizing handling. However, some results obtained considering the root

502

26 Comfort Performance

mean square value of the acceleration and the dynamic component of the force show
that, even when using a simpliﬁed linearized model, the value optimizing comfort is
lower than that optimizing handling.

The last statement is also conﬁrmed by other considerations. Firstly, the reduction
of the force is not the only goal in handling optimization. The displacement of
the sprung with respect to the unsprung masses is also important. Every type of
suspension has some deviations from a perfect kinematic guide, thus causing the
wheels to be set in a position different from the nominal (e.g., changes of the camber
angles, roll steer etc.); this negatively affects the handling characteristics of the
vehicle. The larger the displacement of the sprung mass, the worse the problem.

Operating in the same way as for minimizing the acceleration, it can be shown

that the value of the damping minimizing displacement is

(cid:12)

c =

m(P + K )(P + 2K )
2P

,

(26.157)

which is higher than the optimum value computed above.

This also suggests an increase in the stiffness of the suspensions and goes against
the criterion of “the softer the better” deriving from consideration of the vertical
acceleration alone.

Another point is linked to roll oscillations. The damping of the shock absorbers
is usually chosen with bounce in mind; this causes rolling motions in most cases to
be excessively underdamped. When anti-roll bars are used, the situation becomes
worse: By increasing roll stiffness without increasing the corresponding damping,
they cause a more marked underdamped behavior and a decrease of the dynamic
stability of roll motions. This not only increases the amplitude of rolling motions
and the dynamic load transfer, while lowering the roll angle in steady state conditions,
but also makes rollover in dynamic conditions easier.

The increase of shock absorber damping beyond the value deﬁned above as opti-
mum is effective in reducing these effects, which affect handling more than comfort.
On the other hand, the need for reducing jerk to increase comfort goes in the oppo-
site direction. The value of damping minimizing jerk is lower than that minimizing
acceleration, which leads to better comfort when damping is decreased.

The effect of the stiffness of springs on comfort is in a way contradictory: On
one hand, as already stated, the need of reducing vertical accelerations suggests that
stiffness be reduced as much as possible, but this would lead to very low natural
frequencies which may, in turn, cause motion sickness and similar effects.

The compliance of the frame or of other parts of the vehiclemay also affect riding
comfort. The effect of the compliance of those elements that, in simpliﬁed models,
are assumed to be stiff, is at any rate smaller than the effect the ﬂexibility of the same
elements has on handling. While, as already stated, the compliance of the body in
bending in the x y plane and above all the torsional compliance about the z axis may
have a strong effect (usually reducing performance) on handling, bending compliance
in the x z plane may affect comfort, though not always in a negative way.

26.8 Concluding Remarks on RIDE Comfort

503

The local compliance of the body and the frame may strongly affect acoustic
and vibrational comfort when it leads to natural frequencies that can be excited by
the forcing functions that are always present on a vehicle. A typical example is
the compliance of the supporting structure of the engine ancillaries (alternator, air
conditioning compressor, etc.) that may cause resonances of the system made by the
same elements, the supporting brackets, the belts and other elements connected to
them. Because such a system is located close to, or even directly on, the engine, which
is a strong source of excitations at various frequencies, many resonant vibrations are
possible.

As usual, when local resonances are possible, there are many different cures:

• Increasing the damping of the system, usually by adding damping material, to
reduce the amplitude of vibration below acceptable limits. This is the simplest
cure, one that may induce a non-negligible increase of weight and often gives only
marginal improvements. A typical example is the application of damping paints
or sheet metal covered by damping material on the ﬂoor or the ﬁrewall.

• Increasing the stiffness of the structure, so as to increase the natural frequencies
and thus move the resonance to frequencies at which there is little excitation.
The opposite method, reducing the stiffness to decrease the natural frequencies,
is usually not applicable in the automotive ﬁeld, because it would cause excessive
deformations and would, at any rate, induce several low frequency resonances.
This cure usually causes a weight penalty as well and to increase the stiffness of
a vibrating system without also increasing the damping makes the system more
underdamped, with the consequence of increasing the amplitude of vibration in
case a resonance occurs.

• Reducing the amplitude of the excitation at the source. Although this is the most
effective cure, it is seldom applicable. To reduce the vibration caused by imbalance
of rotating elements the best procedure is to improve balancing, but the prescribed
balancing grade is usually chosen compatibly with constraints such as construc-
tion techniques and costs. Moreover, wear can reduce balance over time and the
compliance of rotating elements may make it difﬁcult to obtain good balancing in
all operating conditions.

• Preventing vibration transmitted from the source to the resonant element. This
often requires design changes or innovative concepts. For instance, the transmis-
sion of vibration from the engine to the passenger compartment is drastically
reduced, with improvements in acoustic and vibrational comfort, by substituting
the standard rigid linkage for gearbox control with a device based on ﬂexible
cables.

• Adding dampers close to the zones affected by vibration. The use of dynamic
vibration absorbers is widespread in automotive technology, both on the chassis
and in the engine (crankshaft dampers, etc.). Because the components of the vehicle
are excited by a number of frequencies in a wide range, damped vibration absorbers
(i.e., containing dissipative elements) are usually used instead of purely dynamic
absorbers. The example given for the quarter-car with dynamic vibration absorber
can be extended to other cases.

Driving Assistance and Autonomous
Vehicles

27.1 Traditional Vehicles

As already stated, a road vehicle on pneumatic tires cannot maintain a given trajectory
under the effect of external perturbations unless managed by some control device,
which is usually a human driver. Its stability solely involves such state variables as
the sideslip angle β and the yaw velocity r .

In the case of two-wheeled vehicles the capsize motion is intrinsically unstable
forcing the driver not only to control the trajectory but also to stabilize the vehicle.
In all traditional vehicles of the second half of the twentieth century up to the
1990s, the driver had to perform all control and monitoring tasks. The only assistance
came from devices like power steering or power brakes that ampliﬁed the force the
driver exerted on the controls. In this situation, the human controller is fully inserted
in the control loop or, as usually said, the system includes a human in the loop.

The only automatic device which helped drivers in their task was the automatic
transmission, which was available as an optional in many cars, and allowed the driver
to avoid operating the clutch pedal and the gear lever: the vehicle was able to shift
gears by itself and to engage and disengage automatically the transmission with the
engine.

In traditional vehicles the driver had to control high-level functions (choice of the
trajectory, decisions about speed and driving style, about manoeuvres like overtaking,
etc.) and intermediate-level functions (reacting to perturbations coming from the air
and the road, following the chosen trajectory, etc.). Only stability at the lowest level,
involving the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity, was provided by the dynamic
behavior of the vehicle. As already stated, in motorbikes the driver had also to act as
a stabilizer against capsizing.

In particular, in this kind of vehicles:

• Direction control is implemented by applying a torque to the steering wheel that is
then transmitted through a mechanical system (steering box, steering arms, various
linkages) to the steering wheels, which are always the front wheels. The torque
exerted by the driver may be increased by a hydro-pneumatic or electromechanical
Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

system (power steering) that nonetheless never replaces the driver by exerting the
whole moment. The required sensitivity is provided by the torque the steering
system exerts on the driver through the aligning torque and the contact forces at
the wheel-road interface. These, in turn, depend upon the geometry of the steering
system (caster angle, toe-in, offsets, etc.).

• The control of the power supplied by the engine is managed through the accelerator
pedal, operating directly through a mechanical leverage. Sensitivity is supplied by
the elastic reaction of a spring that reacts to the motion of the pedal. The driver
must control the power accurately enough so that the maximum force the wheel
can exert on the ground is not exceeded.

• Engine control is accompanied by control of the gearbox and the clutch, which
operate through the clutch pedal and the gear lever. As already stated, these controls
are the only ones to be automatic in many traditional vehicles.

• Braking control is performed by applying a force on the brake pedal that is then
transmitted through a system (usually hydraulic, or pneumatic in industrial vehi-
cles) to the brakes located in all wheels. Here the force exerted by the driver can
also be augmented by a hydro-pneumatic device (power braking). In all cases,
sensitivity is granted by the fact that the force exerted by the driver is proportional
(or at least depends in an almost linear way) to the braking torque and then to the
braking force. The driver must control the braking force so that the wheels do not
lock.

These basic controls are accompanied by many secondary controls, such as those of
the lighting systems, window cleaning and defrosting, parking brake etc. Although
not directly used to control the motion of the vehicle, these are extremely important
for driving safety. The basic controls are standardized on all vehicles, with some
difference in special vehicles, and are subjected to detailed standards. In the case
of particular arrangements, to be used by persons with disabilities of various kinds
that do not allow them to operate conventional controls directly, a non-conventional
user interface is provided, designed as needed for each particular installation. The
transmission of commands, however, remains the same: for instance, the accelerator
control may be brought to the steering wheel with a ring coaxial to the wheel that
can be moved axially. This, in turn, operates the conventional accelerator control
through levers.

The situation with two-wheeled vehicles is essentially the same, the only differ-
ence being that the driver can change the inertial and geometrical characteristics of
the vehicle, using these changes as control inputs: for instance, he can move the
center of mass sideways or change the aerodynamic characteristics. The controls are
obviously different, with the front and rear brakes often operating independently.

27.2 By Wire Systems

27.2 By Wire Systems

507

The transmission of the controls from the user interface to the controlled device is
performed by a mechanical system, except for the brakes which are operated by
an hydraulic system—in cars, a pneumatic system in industrial venicles. Even in
conventional vehicles there was a tendency toward a larger use of hydraulic—or
pneumatic—actuation in particular in connection to power steering or power brak-
ing but also for the actuation of the clutch. Control of the actuators is performed
by electrovalves and the actuation power is supplied by pumps, which are usually
powered by the engine or by electric motors.

A similar situation was typical also in aeronautics, where commands were trans-
mitted by mechanical (rods, cables, etc.) or hydraulic devices. Nowadays the situation
has changed and commands are transmitted by electric systems (ﬂy by wire), the only
exception being small and low cost aircraft. There are two main advantages: ﬁrst,
freedom in architecture and layout is greatly increased (it is much easier to route
electric cables than mechanical controls), resulting in a mass reduction. Second, it
is much easier to integrate control systems, which are mostly electronic, in by wire
than in conventional architectures. In the most modern aircraft, the pilot interacts
with a computer that in turn actuates the control surfaces through by wire devices.

A similar evolution is also underway in the automotive industry. Here the term
steer by wire is used for the steer control, brake by wire for the braking function and
drive by wire for the accelerator control. The latter has become a standard device
on almost all cars for reducing gaseous emissions and improving drivability and
has given the opportunity to introduce the automatic speed control at virtually no
additional cost. The generic term for these systems is X by wire, where the generic X
stands for the various controls. The advantages are similar to those in the aeronautical
ﬁeld, with the added bonus of allowing the use of different user interfaces that can,
for example, be designed speciﬁcally for disabled persons and even adapted for
individual cases.

However, the transfer from the aeronautic ﬂy by wire to the automotive X by wire
is not simple. A ﬁrst difference between the two ﬁelds is linked to cost, or better, to
the ratio reliability/cost. The total cost of an aircraft is greater than the cost of a motor
vehicle by orders of magnitude, allowing the use of control systems and components
much more expensive than those that may be used in vehicles. Something similar
can be said for the low cost segment of the aeronautical market: ﬂy by wire systems
are still not used in light and ultralight aviation.

The scale of production may mitigate this problem: development costs are subdi-
vided, in the automotive market, into a much greater (even by orders of magnitude)
number of machines than in the aeronautical market. Reliability is strictly linked to
costs: when dealing with functions that are vital for safety, like steering or braking,
the need for extremely high reliability leads to high costs, because the required safety
is obtained through redundancy of sensors, actuators, control units and communica-
tion lines as well as high quality components. Electronic and computer based devices

508

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

have been available for motor vehicles for several years in non-vital functions and,
more often, in gadgets performing tasks that are of little practical use.

However, it is not just a matter of cost: motor vehicles are designed for general use;
their mission analysis is less determinate than that of aircraft, and they must be able
to work in conditions far from those for which they have been designed, with a less
stringent respect for maintenance schedules. This makes technology transfer from
aeronautics to automotive industry even more difﬁcult, particularly where complex
and even critical technologies are concerned.

The development of electromechanical components and systems has led to the
consideration of alternative solutions in which electric actuators are controlled
directly without the need for electrovalves, pumps and other hydraulic or pneumatic
devices. The tendency to replace hydraulic and pneumatic devices with electric sys-
tems is widespread and in many ﬁelds more-electric or even all-electric systems are
considered. The advantages are many, among them the following:

• interfacing electric devices to control systems is easier than hydraulic devices;
• the transmission of power and command signals requires electric cables, which
allow much greater freedom of layout than hydraulic pipes or mechanical trans-
missions as used with mechanical controls;

• electric devices are less affected by environmental conditions, above all tempera-
ture, than hydraulic systems. In particular, in the latter the viscosity of hydraulic
ﬂuids is strongly dependent on temperature;

• the ﬂuids used in hydraulic devices require anti-pollution measures during con-
struction, maintenance and ultimately disposal of the vehicle that are not required
in electric devices.

The drawbacks of electric devices that have up to now hampered their diffusion

are:

• electric actuators are in general heavier and often more bulky than the correspond-

ing hydraulic actuators;

• the cost of high performance magnetic materials (in particular rare earth magnets)

is still high for automotive applications;

• electric systems are in general stiffer than hydraulic systems requiring a more

precise control. They may cause more noise and vibration.

Progress in the ﬁelds of magnetic materials (above all permanent magnets), control
systems and power ampliﬁers is gradually reducing these drawbacks allowing us to
predict that the implementation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems will diminish.
The cost of permanent magnets with high energy density is also decreasing, thanks
to a liberalization of the markets due to the expiry of many patents.

An apparently marginal problem that is nonetheless hampering the introduction
of by wire devices is the voltage of the on-board electric system. The increase in the
power of the electric devices on motor vehicles makes it convenient to increase the
voltage from the traditional (on cars) 12 V to at least 24 V, as on industrial vehicles,
or even to 36 or 48 V. In this way, the current needed by the various devices would

27.2 By Wire Systems

509

be reduced, with advantages in cost and weight. This is not a marginal change, as
it might seem, because it would require the simultaneous redesign, production and
marketing of a large number of new electric components (batteries, bulbs, switches,
electric motors, etc.).

Another problem under intense study is electromagnetic compatibility. The elec-
tromagnetic environment in which automotive electromechanical and electronic
devices must operate is very dirty, which may induce malfunctionings of differ-
ent kinds. These must be by all means prevented when electric systems are entrusted
functions that are vital for the safety of the vehicle.

By wire systems are now one of the most actively researched ﬁelds in the auto-
motive industry, with different solutions under study. They will probably enter mass
production in the relatively near future. The following sections will deal brieﬂy with
some applications already mentioned in this text. Note that the problems to be solved
before vehicles completely controlled by wire may be marketed are not only technical
(design, production, marketing, etc.) but also legal, regulatory and standards-based.
Apart from the above mentioned advantages of by wire systems, they lend them-
selves to be easily interfaced with control system which can assist the driver in his/her
tasks, something which can improve both safety and driving comfort.

27.2.1 Steer by Wire

Electric steering systems like Electric Power Steering (EPS) are in common use,
primarily in cars in the low or medium market segment. Their application does not
imply substitution for the mechanical steering system, but simply the presence of an
electric actuator in parallel with the manual steering system. The electric motor may
act directly, exerting a torque on the steering wheel shaft, or it may exert a force on
the rack. The torque exerted by the power steering is proportional to that applied by
the driver, following strategies that may depend on many parameters. The steering
control may be made ‘harder’ with increasing speed, to compensate for the decrease
of steering torque typical of many cars and to induce the driver to act on the wheel
with more care.

In a true by wire system, there is no direct control link and the steering wheel is
connected solely to a rotation sensor (potentiometer, encoder...) or a torque sensor
supplying the value of the angle or the moment to the system that controls the
steering actuator. A system of this kind is much more ﬂexible, allowing different
control strategies to be used, such as a variable ratio between the rotation of the
steering wheel and the steering rotation of the wheels. This allows the command
from the driver to interact in a more complex way with the command from the
control system. Because there is no direct link between the wheels and the steering
wheel, there must be an actuator exerting a torque on the steering wheel to supply the
driver with information on the working conditions of the wheels. Devices providing
an artiﬁcial sensibility, often referred to as haptic, provide a reaction force through
by wire controls that is similar to the reaction that conventional mechanical controls

510

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

would supply. They may also add further information, like the devices that cause
the accelerator or the brake pedal to shake when getting close to slip conditions
in traction or braking or other dangerous situations (e.g. signalling the intention to
overtake, when the lane at the left is occupied by another vehicle). Such devices are
intrinsically necessary when controls are made automatic. They are at present under
study and in many cases are already on the market.

27.2.2 Brake by Wire

Electric power brakes may be simple devices in which an electric motor actuates
a pump amplifying the command given by the driver through the master cylinder
connected with the brake pedal. In more complicated systems no pump is connected
with the brake pedal, with the latter simply supplying a position or force signal that,
through a control system, acts on the actuators at the brakes.

Electric braking may be performed in two radically different ways: by electrically
actuating the pump of a conventional hydraulic (pneumatic in industrial vehicles)
system, or by substituting an electric braking system for the hydraulic one. This
second strategy may in turn be implemented in two different ways, by replacing the
hydraulic system with an electromechanical one (including, for instance, an electric
motor in each wheel that operates the calipers using a ball screw) or by putting a
pump operated by an electric motor in each wheel, sending pressurized liquid to a
more or less conventional caliper. The choice among the various solutions must take
into account the mass, the cost, the reliability of the system, the need for maintenance
and adjustments, and the possibility of self-adjusting.

Even if all these approaches allow ABS and possibly TCS functions to be inte-
grated more easily into the braking system, only the total replacement of the hydraulic
system with an electromechanical one where the electric control reaches each wheel
directly (possibly using a fully electromechanical actuator) allows the full perfor-
mance predicted for by wire devices to be attained, but at the cost of many reliability
problems.

27.2.3 Other by Wire Controls

As already stated, all functions of the vehicle may be controlled by electromechan-
ical actuators. Because control of the engine is the simplest, conversions to by wire
accelerators are now common. The clutch and the gearbox may also be controlled by
electric devices. Apart from the advantage of avoiding mechanical linkages between
the gearbox and the passenger compartment, which may transmit vibration, this solu-
tion allows for the building of fully automated gearboxes. Secondary controls, such
as the parking brake, may also be replaced by electric devices, with the advantages
of automation (in the case of the parking brake, it is possible to guarantee that the

27.2 By Wire Systems

511

brake is applied when the vehicle is stopped and released when it is moved by the
engine), thus allowing a greater freedom in command placement and design of the
user interface, as well as a much simpler design of the command transmission.

27.2.4 Electromechanical Suspensions

Electromchanical suspensions have little to do with by-wire systems, and should
not enter this section; however they are dealt with here because they are a part
of the trend towards ‘more electric’ vehicles. Semi-active suspensions already use
systems that are at least partially electromechanical, such as the shock absorbers
based on electrorheological of magnetorheological ﬂuids. Electric actuators may
replace hydraulic actuators in active suspensions (for instance in Active Roll Control,
ARC systems) and above all, electromechanical eddy current dampers may replace
classical shock absorbers. In particular, eddy current dampers may work as passive,
uncontrolled components (in this case they may behave as almost perfect viscous
dampers, without the drawback of the presence of the ﬂuid and with a greater stability
in changing environmental conditions), they may be inserted in an electric circuit
containing controlled elements or they may work in a fully active way. At present,
their mass is comparable to that of similar hydraulic devices and their cost, although
still higher, is quickly decreasing.

27.3 Assistance Systems for Longitudinal Control

As stated above, one of the advantages of by wire systems is the possibility of
interfacing them with sophisticated, microprocessor based, control systems which
can assist the driver.

One source of inspiration is what has been done in the ﬁeld of aeronautics. Since
World War II, devices able to keep an aircraft at a given attitude and on a prescribed
course, allowing the pilot to leave the controls for a more or less prolonged time, have
entered common use. Such devices do not need to sense external conditions and adapt
to them; they are simple regulators, that only need to maintain the predetermined
motion conditions. Devices of this kind have only a limited use in road vehicles
(for instance, cruise control devices) because vehicles must continuously adapt their
motion to the road and trafﬁc conditions.

Military aircraft are increasingly built with conﬁgurations that reduce intrinsic
stability or are even unstable, with the goal of improving manoeuvrability; the task
of stabilizing the aircraft is given to suitable control devices. Moreover, the senses
of the pilot have been enhanced by supplying additional information through the
control devices, such as devices that shake the control stick when stall conditions
approach. Artiﬁcial stability may prove interesting in the vehicular ﬁeld as well, not

512

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

so much for improving manoeuvrability as for allowing the use of conﬁgurations
that are advantageous but reduce stability.

Devices which assist drivers in their task are becoming increasingly common in
the automotive ﬁeld, and in many cases are also considered as a ﬁrst step in the way
toward autonomous vehicles. In the following these driving assistance devices will be
subdivided into low level systems,—which help the driver in his/her action to apply
brakes or driving power or to turn the steering wheel—and high level systems—
which take also the higher level decision, deciding also when and how much to
brake or to accelerate—and also following the particular area in which they work
(longitudinal dynamics, handling and comfort.

The low level assistance systems for longitudinal control are:

• Engine control systems. All modern automotive internal combustion engines are
provided with one or more Electronic Control Units (ECU) that control its main
functions. The motor control may be conventional or by wire, but in the latter case
there is no problem in supplying the driver with adequate sensory inputs. Because
these systems are studied in conjunction with the engine and not with the chassis,
they will not be dealt with here.

• Longitudinal slip control in braking, (ABS, Antilock Braking System). They are
systems that detect the beginning of wheel skid and reduce the braking torques.
They should measure the longitudinal slip of the tires, but actually measure the
deceleration of the wheels.

• Longitudinal slip control in traction, (ASR, Anti Spin Regulator or TCS, Traction
Control Systems1). These are systems that detect the beginning of driving wheel
skid and reduce the power supplied by the engine. Theoretically, they should mea-
sure the longitudinal slip of the tires, but in practice they measure the acceleration
of the driving wheels.

• Servo controlled gearbox and clutch. These systems provide automatic gearbox
functions by controlling a more or less conventional manual transmission using
suitable actuators, with all the advantages of classic automatic transmissions but
with a much more efﬁcient mechanical transmission without a torque converter.

The high level assistance systems for longitudinal control are:
• Cruise control systems, i.e. systems which regulate the speed of the vehicle to
maintain it at a preset value decided by the driver. An advanced form of cruise
control system is also able to detect other vehicles travelling in the same lane and,
if their speed is lower than the preset speed, adapts the latter to maintain a ﬁxed
distance from the former (Adaptive Cruise Control, ACC).
The simple cruise control system was invented in 1948 and entered production in
1958. It is just a speed regulator which automatically disengages when the driver
presses the brake pedal. In case the driver presses the accelerator pedal, for instance
to overtake, the car follows this command, to resume the preset speed as soon as
the driver releases the accelerator. It will be dealt with no more.

1The acronyms here mentioned are often trade marks of a particular manufacturer, even if many of
them have entered technical jargon to designate a variety of similar devices.

27.3 Assistance Systems for Longitudinal Control

513

An ACC works in the same way, but when the sensors detect another vehicle
travelling on the same lane it reduces the speed to follow the latter at a preset
distance, continuously adapting the speed to perform this task. Moreover, the
preset distance changes with the speed, to remain always at a safe distance. Also
this systems disengages automatically when the driver depresses the brake pedal.
• Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems, which alert the driver that there is
an obstacle on the vehicles path, and its advanced version, the Advanced Emer-
gency Braking System (AEBS) (also called Autonomous Emergency Braking
(AEB), collision avoidance system, precrash system, or collision mitigating sys-
tem), which also activates the brakes to avoid the collision, or at least to mitigate
its severity. FCW will not be dealt with any more, since it may be considered as a
part of an AEBS.

All the mentioned systems allow the tasks of the driver to be simpliﬁed and safety
increased, assuming that they meet reliability standards. The driver is still in the
control loop, but his work is made simpler by avoiding low-level or intermediate-
level control tasks so that he can concentrate on high-level decisions.

27.3.1 Antilock (ABS) Systems

Basic Principles

The force a tire can exert in the longitudinal direction at the wheel-road contact is
limited by the available traction. As previously stated when dealing with the tire, to
exert a longitudinal force the tire must work with a longitudinal slip, i.e. its angular
velocity must be different (smaller when braking, larger when driving) from that
characterizing pure rolling. Longitudinal slip was deﬁned as

where v is the average slip velocity of the tire on the ground. The longitudinal force,
or better the longitudinal force coefﬁcient

σ =

v

,

μx = Fx

is linked to the slip by a nonlinear relationship of the type shown in Fig. 27.1, where
both force and slip are assumed to be negative in braking and positive in driving.

The dashed lines indicate unstable working of the tire: once the traction has
reached its peak value, not only does the force decrease, but the wheel tends to lock
if braking, or to accelerate until a full slip is reached if driving. The equation of
motion of a free wheeling wheel in braking is

514

= Mm − Mb = |μx | Fzrl − Mb ,

(27.1)

where the driving torque acting on the wheel Mm is due to the longitudinal force at
the wheel-road contact |μx | Fz multiplied by the loaded radius rl. If |μx | decreases
at increasing slip, any slowing down of the wheel, with an accompanying increase
in the absolute value of the slip, will cause a decrease of the longitudinal force and
then a further slowing down of the wheel and a further increase of the slip. If the
driver does not reduce the braking torque by releasing the pressure on the brakes, the
wheels lock. In a similar way, a driving wheel accelerates until it spins freely.

Note that the peak, and the following decrease of traction, are more pronounced
in case of high performance tires: racing tires can show values of μx p much higher
than one (even up to 1.8–2), while the value at complete slip μxs remains not much
greater than 1. The tendency for the wheel to lock or go into uncontrolled spin is
then much greater.

The problems linked with the slipping of a pneumatic tire are, however, not linked
solely to the ensuing decrease of the longitudinal force, but deeply affect handling and
the very stability of the vehicle. When the traction used in the longitudinal direction
increases, the ability of the tire to supply cornering forces decreases and, when the
limit traction conditions are reached, the force the tire exerts on the ground has the
same direction as the relative velocity between the thread band and the ground. In
these conditions, the cornering stiffness of the tire practically vanishes and the wheel
loses its ability to supply cornering forces. If the rear wheels lock, the vehicle becomes
unstable, while locking of the front wheels causes the vehicle to be uncontrollable,
in the sense that it can move only on a straight trajectory.

In traditional vehicles it is the driver who, with his ability to understand the con-
ditions of the vehicle, controls braking forces so that maximum traction conditions

of the peripheral velocity of the wheel during braking with ABS. b Zone of the curve μx (σ) where
the ABS keeps the longitudinal force coefﬁcient

are never exceeded. The usefulness of devices that can help the driver in this task is
obvious. They can keep the slip of the wheels under control and prevent maximum
traction conditions from being exceeded. Actually, it is difﬁcult to measure the longi-
tudinal slip of the tires, because it would require the angular velocity of the wheels to
be measured (a simple matter) as well as the speed of the vehicle, a complicated task,
and one that requires instrumentation of a kind not usually provided on vehicles.2

The ﬁrst devices of this kind to be used were the anti lock systems (ABS) used on
aircraft for braking during landings and aborted takeoffs. Such devices only measured
the speed of the wheel and computed its derivative: a quick decrease of speed shows
that locking is about to occur. Subsequently, the device directly reduces the pressure
in the hydraulic braking system and then reduces the braking torque. The wheel then
returns to a speed close to that of pure rolling and the system ceases to intervene.
Braking then recurs, making it likely that the locking conditions repeat, with an
ensuing new intervention of the ABS device. Brakes then act as before, with frequent
intervention by the ABS, and the longitudinal force coefﬁcient remains close to its
maximum value (Fig. 27.2).

Controlling braking in this way does not allow a traction as good as that at the
maximum of the curve μx (σ) to be obtained, but it does prevent the wheel from
locking and allows a fair lateral force and cornering stiffness to be maintained.

In the automotive ﬁeld, ABS were initially applied to trailers, owing to the dif-
ﬁculties the driver has in understanding trailer braking conditions. They were then
applied to industrial vehicles and luxury cars. All cars sold today must be equipped
with ABS.

2Normal speedometers, always present on motor vehicles, estimate the velocity of the vehicle from
that of an element connected with the output shaft of the gearbox, assuming that the wheels are in
pure rolling conditions. Regulations state that speedometers may have only positive errors, i.e. the
speed they show must never be less than the actual.

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

The control logic of anti lock systems evolved, even if it is still based mostly on the
measurement of the speed of the wheels and on the computation of their deceleration.
However, while this method is adequate for free wheels, things are more complex
for driving wheels. Here, the inertia of the engine and the transmission must be
accounted for along with the inertia of the wheel, and the value of Jr in Eq. (27.1),
which depends on the transmission ratio, is much higher. While in the highest gear the
apparent increase of the inertia of the wheel may be of 200% or 300%, in the lowest
gear the inertia may increase by one or two orders of magnitude. The deceleration
of the wheel in these conditions may also depend on both the braking torque of the
engine and the position of the accelerator. It may be low enough to prevent the increase
of the longitudinal slip from being detected in wheel acceleration measurements.

It is important to evaluate the slip but, as already stated, a measurement of the speed
of the vehicle that does not depend on the speed of the wheels is needed, requiring
complex and costly equipment. Different strategies are possible, and sometimes
more than one can apply. A reference velocity can be deﬁned by elaborating the
speeds of all wheels and possibly the longitudinal deceleration of the vehicle as
well. By averaging the speed of the wheels, it is possible to obtain a reliable value
for the reference velocity, until a quick deceleration of the wheels shows that the
longitudinal slip has begun to increase.

By integrating the acceleration of the vehicle in time it is possible to update
the values of the speed to obtain a better estimate of the slip. At this point it is
possible to use different deﬁnitions of the reference speed and different algorithms
to compute it, possibly using different deﬁnitions for the various axles as well, so that
the required performance can be obtained. Suitable corrections may be introduced
to take different factors into account, such as the roughness of the road, which is
detected from oscillations in the wheel deceleration. It is possible that in the near
future devices allowing the vehicle speed to be obtained directly will be available,
devices based, for instance, on GPS. By estimating, or even better, by measuring the
vehicle speed and then the longitudinal slip, the control system can not only prevent
the wheels from locking, but may also try to maintain the slip in the zone where the
braking force is highest.

Control Strategies for ABS

How the anti lock system acts on the various wheels has a large effect on stability.
Older systems were simple two channel devices, i.e. they jointly controlled the two
wheels of the same axle. The control of an axle may be performed following two
distinct strategies, usually referred to as select high and select low. In the former
case, if the wheels are in different conditions, the wheel governing the behavior of
the system is the one in the best condition. In other words, the ABS device allows the
wheel in the worst condition to slip, reducing the pressure in the braking system only
when the wheel in the best situation begins to slip. The second strategy, on the other
hand, begins to reduce the braking pressure when the wheel in the worst condition
encounters a critical situation.

The latter strategy guarantees that the two wheels exert the same longitudinal
force, thus preventing yawing moments. But it decreases the total amount of braking

27.3 Assistance Systems for Longitudinal Control

517

force to what the axle could exert when all its wheels are in the condition of the
wheel that initially slips. Another advantage is that it guarantees a high value for the
cornering stiffness of the axle.

Select high strategy, on the other hand, allows the ability of the wheel in the best
condition to exert a high force to be exploited, while the other wheel works in con-
ditions close to slipping. The braking force is much higher, but the axle produces
a yawing moment that may be quite strong. The ability of the axle to produce cor-
nering forces is compromised, because the cornering stiffness of the wheel in the
worst condition vanishes, while that of the other wheel is reduced due to the strong
longitudinal force.

A reasonable global strategy is to use select low at the rear wheels, which do not, in
any case, exert large braking forces, and select high at the front wheels which produce
most of the braking force. The total braking force is thus close to the highest possible,
the rear axle has good cornering stiffness, while that of the front axle decreases, with
the result that the vehicle is more understeer and thus more stable. The drawback is
the generation of a yawing moment that compels the driver to control the trajectory
by acting on the steering wheel, with a steering angle that, owing to the decrease of
the ability of the front wheels to generate lateral forces, may be large.

Performance is increased by using two separate ABS systems at the front axle,
so that the wheel in worst conditions does not lock, with an increase of the overall
braking force, decrease of the yawing moment and, above all, lower reduction of the
corner stiffness of the front wheels. The vehicle remains more manoeuvrable, and it
is easier for the driver to counteract the yawing moment.

The rear axle may remain controlled by a single ABS device with a select low
logic. The system then has three channels, or it may have two distinct ABS devices.
In the latter case (four channel ABS), the select low strategy may be implemented
on the ECU, keeping open the possibility of modifying the strategy depending on
the values of a number of parameters.

The ground is usually not uniform, so the traction may change from wheel to
wheel. However, the average traction (in time) is the same usually for all wheels. In
some cases, the road under the wheels on one side has characteristics that are not the
same as those at the other side, such as when the wheels near the curb are on wet road
or, even worse, on snow or ice, while those toward the center of the road are on a clean
and dry surface. These conditions are usually referred to as μ-split. In this case, a
select low strategy at the front axle would lead to very low values of the braking force,
while a select high strategy may lead to very high yawing moments. The use of an
accelerometer measuring yawing accelerations or an instrument that can measure the
yaw angular velocity allows intermediate strategies to be implemented. The braking
force on the front wheel that is in better conditions can be limited when the yaw
angular acceleration increases, so that the stability of the vehicle can be maintained
without overly penalizing the braking force. A strategy of this type depends largely
on the characteristics of the vehicle, and particularly on its moment of inertia about
the yaw axis and its geometrical characteristics (wheelbase, track). The larger the
yaw moment of inertia, the larger the allowable yaw moments.

518

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

The devices used to implement an ABS system were described in Part I. Here we
must just remember that although an ABS device is conceptually simple (to reduce
the braking torque it is sufﬁcient to use an electrovalve discharging a quantity of high
pressure ﬂuid from the hydraulic system, thus reducing the pressure in the cylinders
of the brakes), in practice a simple ABS of this kind cannot be used, because after
a number of interventions the brake pedal would sink owing to the discharge of
ﬂuid. This problem may be solved at the cost of greater system complexity, using a
pump actuated by an electric motor that takes the discharged ﬂuid and reintroduces
it into the high pressure part of the circuit. There are alternatives that avoid adding
an electric motor with its control devices to a system that is already complex, but a
pump allowing the system to be put under pressure with no intervention by the driver
on the brake pedal is required for other functions like traction control.

The ABS system interferes with other devices usually included in the braking
system, such as the pressure proportioning valve. The function of the latter can
actually be integrated into the ABS system, obtaining what is often referred to as
EBD (Electronic Brake Distributor). However, the strategy of an ABS system and
a pressure proportioning valve are radically different. The ﬁrst must step in when
locking conditions are approached, while the second must always function, so that the
braking torques at the rear axle are reduced when the weight acting on it is reduced
because of longitudinal load shift. Conceptually, the slip of the front and rear wheels
must be continuously monitored so that the longitudinal slip at the front is larger than
that at the rear. All the difﬁculties seen for measurement of the slip while dealing
with ABS systems are present, with the simpliﬁcation that what matters here is not an
absolute measurement but simply the measurement in the difference of slip between
the axles. The measurement of the longitudinal acceleration, and then of the load
shift, may be very useful.

27.3.2 Traction Control Systems (TCS, ASR)

The problem of preventing driving wheels from slipping is similar to that of braking
wheels, even if it is usually less severe and occurs only in the case of powerful
vehicles or in conditions of poor traction. Wheel slipping, also in this case, has two
effects: a decrease of the force exerted in the longitudinal direction and a loss of
the ability to exert transversal forces, with effects on stability and driveability. The
latter are considered less severe in front wheel drive vehicles, which become less
controllable, than in rear wheels drive vehicles, which become less stable.

The systems that control the slipping of driving wheels are usually referred to
as Traction Control Systems (TCS) or Anti Spin Regulators (ASR). The sensors
are the same as for the anti lock system: they measure the angular velocity of the
wheels so that their acceleration can be computed. When a wheel begins to spin, it
is possible to react in two ways: either by reducing the power supplied by the engine
or by operating the brakes. The second strategy is usually quicker, but the actual

27.3 Assistance Systems for Longitudinal Control

519

implementation follows a mixed strategy: The brakes are ﬁrst used to slow the wheel
that has begun to spin, after which the power of the engine is reduced.

The two strategies have different effects and are used to solve different problems.
If the vehicle is in symmetrical conditions, i.e., if the right and left wheels are in the
same conditions, it is useless to use brakes and not advisable, because both wheels
of the same axles should be braked. The result is that the transmission is much more
stressed than usual, at least until the power from the engine is reduced. In this case,
the reduction of the driving torque prevents both wheels from slipping.

The advantage is not so much improved performance, because the driving force
the wheels can exert when not slipping is not much greater than they would exert
when slipping (except in the case of high performance tires), but the possibility of
exerting side forces. In particular, in the case of rear wheel drive vehicles, the vehicle
remains stable, while in that of front wheel drive, the vehicle remains manoeuvrable.
The reduction of power may then be realized by acting on the motor control

system.

In case of asymmetric conditions (μ-split), this strategy would penalize perfor-
mances excessively, because it would apply a sort of select low strategy: both wheels
would exert a force equal to what the wheel in the worst conditions can exert.

On the other hand, by braking the slipping wheel, the differential gear subdividing
the driving torque between the driving wheels allows the wheel in better condition
to transfer a torque equal to the sum of the braking torque applied on the other wheel
plus the torque the latter is able to transfer. By acting on the brakes an increase in
performance is obtained, but has a small effect on stability or manoeuvrability. TCS
systems can thus be used as an alternative to controlled slip differential because,
by applying a braking torque on the wheel that would slip, the system allows a
certain driving torque to be transferred to the other wheel even in the case where the
differential is of the simplest type.

While ABS systems act on the braking system to reduce the pressure exerted by
the driver, possibly assisted by the power brake, the TCS must use a pump to put
the hydraulic system under pressure, independent of the force exerted by the driver
on the brake pedal. However, in many cases such a pump is already included in the
ABS system, so the complexity introduced is not great.

To combine the requirements on performance with those on stability, TCS systems
must act on both the engine and the brakes, even at the expense of added complexity.
The two strategies can be mixed following a logic that is based on many parameters,
apart from the wheel slip and the acceleration of the vehicle: for instance, at low
speed it is possible to give priority to acceleration performance through a strategy
based on the use of brakes, while at high speed it is possible to give priority to stability
by acting on the engine.

TCS systems allow drivers with limited ability to drive difﬁcult vehicles, such as

rear wheel drive high powered cars, even in critical road conditions.

27.3.3 Servo Controlled Gearbox and Clutch

Automatic gearboxes are quite old and, particularly in some markets like the Ameri-
can one, are installed on the majority of vehicles. They are mostly based on a torque
converter and on a number of planetary gears which are engaged in different conﬁg-
urations by clutches. However, the low efﬁciency (at least if compared with clutches)
of torque convertes and the complexity and high cost of the whole system (at least in
markets in which the majority of vehicles have manual transmissions and automatics
are offered as optionals) encouraged the research of alternative way to automatize
the transmission.

The ﬁrst solution was to leave the choice of the gear to the driver and to automatize
the manouver of the clutch through an actuator. These semi-automatic transmissions
remained a marginal choice. The advances in control and power electronics and actu-
ators allowed to build more or less conventional mechanical transmissions operated
by actuators and microprocessor-based control systems which perform the choice of
the gear to engage and manouver the clutch. These systems are often called robotized
gearbox or MTA (Mechanical Transmission Automatized).

As an alternative, instead of controlling the clutch with an actuator, it is possible
to use a torque converter, coupled with a conventional transmission controlled by
actuators. However, this intermediate solution doesn’t have substantial advantages
with respect neither to conventional automatic nor to robotized transmissions.

The controller of a robotized gearbox can control the gear shifting, the clutch
and the throttle (or better the engine ECU) choosing the gear and the engine torque,
satisfying the requests of the driver and the constraints, and optimizing the powertrain
behavior, reducing consumptions—and thus greenhouse gases emissions—and air
pollution.

The system can be even controlled by the driver through racing-style paddles on
the back of the steering wheel: the driver need not control the clutch pedal and the gear
lever but is still able to enjoy the driving satisfaction arising out of a direct control
of the transmission. It also improves driving safety through direct control, which
prevents driver errors and incorrect control of the transmission system, offering the
driver a more advanced vehicle interface.

In these systems, neither the clutch nor the gearbox need to be modiﬁed for instal-
lation of the hydraulic actuators used to control clutch travel and gear engagement
and selection manoeuvres.

It must be said that the idea that a conventional gearbox can be transformed into
a robotized one by simply adding the actuators is naive: a well trained human driver
moves the gear shift lever in a smart way, engaging the gears even when the gear
mechanism has inaccuracies and clearances, while the actuator cannot perform in this
way: as a result, to be successfully operated by actuators the gearbox must be built
with much greater accuracy. As it is often the case, to build a successful automatic
system, the problems lie in the mechanical subsistem more than in the control or in
the actuators.

27.3.4 Adaptive Cruise Control Systems

Cruise control systems are now found in most cars, at least as an option, but they are
practically useful only in particular conditions: they were ﬁrst applied in the United
States, where they are usable primarily on interstate highways, while in Europe they
can be used on highways only when trafﬁc is particularly low.

When trafﬁc is intense, and in particular when there is a line of cars, the driver
has to control the accelerator pedal, and occasionally the brakes as well, to maintain
a constant distance from the vehicle travelling in the same lane in front of him. In
these conditions, long lines of cars can form on highways, with each driver trying
to regulate the speed of his vehicle so that the distance from the previous vehicle is
constant. In these conditions Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) devices are of more
use.

Present ACC are based on on-board sensors, like a radar or laser (Light Detection
And Ranging, LiDAR) distance sensor or, in some case, a stereoscopic camera. It is
possible that in the future systems which use also information coming from roadside
beacons, reﬂectors placed on the back of other cars or satellites (GPS) will be used.
These are called Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). The sensors of ACC
work day and night, but their abilities are hampered by heavy rain, fog, or snow.

In case several sensors are present, sensor fusion to integrate the data from the var-
ious sensors is required. In this way the working of the device is improved, obtaining
greater safety. GPS data can provide further information about the road and speciﬁc
features, like stop signals or incoming trafﬁc lanes. The microprocessor which con-
trols the system can be programmed to make predictions of other vehicles’ behavior,
reacting in advance and avoiding sharp manouvers.

A very simple model of driver, which is around since decades, can be adapted as a
basis for the ACC programming. It is based on a linear controller based on measuring
the distance from the previous vehicle. Let Vi and di be the speed of the ith vehicle
and the distance between the ith and the (i − 1)th vehicle, whose speed is Vi−1.

The derivative of the distance with respect to time is obviously linked to the speed

by the relationship

d
dt

(di ) = Vi−1 − Vi .

(27.2)

Assume that the driver of the ith vehicle tries to maintain the distance at a ﬁxed
value assessing the distance and acting as a proportional control by accelerating when
the distance increases and decelerating while it decreases. This action is applied with
a certain delay. A linear model for this action is

d Vi (t + τ )
dt

d
dt

= K

(di ) = K (Vi−1 − Vi ) ,

(27.3)

where K is the gain and τ the delay time. Note that in the case of a human driver the
time delay may be fairly large and the evaluation of the distance di is quite rough,
while in case of an ACC the delay is small and the distance can be measured with

(27.4)

(27.5)

(27.6)

522

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

good accuracy. Note also that in this formulation the proportional action is based
not on the measurement of the distance, but actually on the velocity, so more than a
proportional controller it is a derivative controller.

By using the series for the function Vi (t + τ ) truncated after the second term,

Eq. (27.3) reduces to

τ ¨Vi + ˙Vi + K Vi = K Vi−1 ,

which is formally identical to the equation of motion of a second-order system, with
mass τ , unit damping and stiffness K . If

the system has an oscillatory behavior with natural frequency3 and damping ratio

Equation (27.4) can be used to predict the behavior of the vehicle-driver system
that follows another vehicle travelling at constant speed or, at least, at a speed having
a known time history (the law Vi−1(t) is known). The behavior must be quick and
smooth (both τ and K must be small), so that no oscillations are induced.

The same equation may be used to study the behavior of a line of vehicles. Consider
n vehicles (i = 1, ..., n) in a line behind a ﬁrst vehicle (i = 0). Let τi and Ki be the
delay and the gain of the ith vehicle; the n equations of the type of Eq. (27.4) are

As can be seen, the equation describing the behavior of a line of vehicles is then
similar, although not identical, to that governing a system made of a set of masses
linked to each other by springs and dampers. The stiffness matrix is not symmetrical
because the behavior of each vehicle depends on those preceding it, but not those
following it.

3The natural frequency is referred, as usual, to the undamped system. If the damping ratio ζ is larger
than one, the damped system will not have free oscillations.

The present model does not consider the characteristics of the vehicle, and in
particular the possibility that its acceleration is not sufﬁcient to get close to the
preceding one in the predicted way. If a limitation to the acceleration of the vehicle
is introduced, the model is no longer linear, and the approach followed here no longer
holds.

Consider as an example a line of vehicles controlled by identical drivers, with
a gain K = 1.6 1/s and delay τ = 0.6 s. The frequency response of some of the
vehicles to a harmonic variation of the speed of the ﬁrst one is plotted in Fig. 27.3a.
The line of vehicles has a resonant frequency and may be expected to oscillate with
amplitudes which grow along the line. If the time delay is smaller, as it occurs with
ACC devices, there is no resonance and the amplitude of the oscillations started by
the ﬁrst vehicle become smaller and smaller along the line.

524

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

This linearized model is obviously too rough to give quantitative indications,
but qualitatively explains the oscillatory behavior of long lines of vehicles and also
the fact that in the case of dense highway trafﬁc periodic stops can be experienced
without any obvious explanation. Clearly, when the oscillations become too large
the linearized model loses validity: the acceleration required for some vehicles may
be too large or the distance too small, forcing some vehicles to stop.

In case of the ACC the time delay is much smaller, the gain can be set to optimize
the behavior of the system and the precision in measuring the distance and evaluating
the velocity is much better. In these conditions it can be expected that no oscillatory
behavior is present: a widespread use of ACC can make motorway travelling much
more safe and comfortable.

27.3.5 Collision Avoidance Systems

The ﬁrst attempts to demonstrate an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) dates
back to 1995 and the ﬁrst production devices were marketed starting from 1997
in Japan. In 2016, the American National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration
(NHTSA) evaluated that such systems would prevent an estimated 28,000 collisions
and 12,000 injuries each year and announced that by 2022 they should become a
standard equipment on new cars. Similarly, iIn Europe, in 2012 the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) announced that AEB should become
mandatory for new heavy vehicles from 2015.

Collision avoidance systems use radar (all-weather) and sometimes laser (LIDAR)
plus cameras (one or more) equipped with image recognition software to detect
an imminent crash. GPS sensors can also be used to detect ﬁxed dangers such as
approaching stop signs through a location database.

Once an impending collision is detected, these systems provide a warning to the
driver. When the collision becomes imminent, they take action autonomously without
any driver input. This action consists in executing an emergency braking which at
low vehicle speeds (e.g. below 50 km/h) is sufﬁcient to prevent the accident. This
is typical of uban driving, and this ‘easy’ application is quite impotant not only for
avoiding minor accidents with relative small damages to objects, but also severe
accidents with pedestrian and cyclists.

At higher speeds braking may be not the best strategy and a steering manouver to
avoid the obstacle may be more appropriate, but this involves a much more difﬁcult
strategy. First the device must check that the other lanes are clear and then it must have
access to lateral dynamics controls. A device which checks whether the nearby lanes
are free and warns the driver when a lane change to an occupied lane is attempted is
nowadays standard on many cars.

In some studies it was reported that automatic emergency braking would reduce
rear-end crashes by 39% and that if all cars were provided with the system, accidents
could be reduced by up to 27% and up to 8,000 lives would be saved each year in
Europe alone. We must remember that in the 2016 Berlin terror attack, the truck which

27.3 Assistance Systems for Longitudinal Control

525

was driven into the Berlin Christmas market was ﬁnally stopped by its automatic
braking system.

Devices which perform the AEB function also in reverse, and thus require sensors

also at the rear end of the vehicle, are also present in some cars.

27.4 Assistance Systems for Handling Control

27.4.1 General Considerations

The lateral dynamics of the vehicle is controlled by the driver, who creates a yawing
moment by setting the steering wheels at a certain steering angle; this moment causes
a yaw rotation that puts all wheels at a certain yaw angle and consequently produces
a lateral force that alters the trajectory. The yawing torque may be produced in many
ways: acting on the front steering wheels (setting them at a sideslip angle and then
creating a side force that, being applied in front of the center of mass, produces a
yawing moment), acting on all wheels that are steering (setting them at a sideslip
angle in the opposite direction and then producing a yawing moment), and also by
creating a yawing torque directly through differential braking or traction on the right
and left wheels. It is also possible to act on all the wheels, setting them at a steering
angle in the same direction and thus producing directly the side forces needed to
alter the trajectory without any yaw rotation or sideslip angle of the vehicle.

Traditional vehicles are controlled using only the ﬁrst of these strategies: manual
direction control through front wheel steering. If the road conditions are good and
the required manoeuvre is not too severe, the simpliﬁed models seen in Chap. 25
allow the response of the vehicle to be predicted fairly well. The average driver is
able to maintain control without difﬁculty.

In particular, the dynamic analogy of the vehicle with a mass, spring, damper
system (Eqs. 25.110 and 25.110) is fairly accurate and the response to a steering
command δ(t) is that of a second-order system excited by a linear combination of
laws δ(t) and ˙δ(t). The response in terms of yaw velocity and lateral acceleration is
expressed by Eqs. (25.117) and (25.115), and that in term of sideslip angle β(t) is
expressed by Eq. (25.116).

Even if the response is that of a non-minimum phase system, in which the sideslip
angle may initially take values of opposite sign with respect to the steady state value,
the sideslip angle can be felt by the driver only to a limited extent and does not create
confusion or dangerous situations.

It is interesting to study the response of the vehicle if the control strategy is based
on rear wheel steering. The non-stationary response can be computed from previously
seen equations by inserting K1 = 0 and K2 = −1 into Eqs. (25.183) and (25.184).
By using the simpliﬁed expressions of the derivatives of stability, it follows that

where (cid:3) is still expressed by Eq. (25.168).

Note that the steady-state response in terms of yaw velocity r and lateral acceler-
ation is that already seen for front wheel steering, while that in terms of β is similar
except for the term C2 substituting for C1. The steady state response is little changed
if the vehicle is steered by operating the rear instead of the front wheels.

In non stationary conditions, things are quite different. By setting the numerator
of the ﬁrst and the third transfer functions to zero, one can see that the responses in
terms of r and β have only one real positive zero and thus cause no problem. The
zeros of the transfer function ay0

.

(27.14)

The two zeros are real, one positive and one negative. The response is then that of a
non-minimum phase system at all speeds. The vehicle initially accelerates laterally
in a direction opposite to that in which it will accelerate in steady-state, disorienting
the driver.

It has been proven that it is still possible to drive the vehicle under these conditions,
provided that the driver is suitably trained, but driving using the rear wheels is
much more difﬁcult. This solution is used only on very slow vehicles (earth-moving
machines, dumpers, etc.), because the zero in the right half plane of the roots locus
tends to move towards the origin when the speed tends to zero.

The above mentioned considerations are based on linearized models. The expe-
rience of the average driver is based on driving conditions in which the behavior of
the vehicle is essentially linear. If the limit conditions are approached, either because
road conditions are poor or because high performance is required, the nonlinearity
of the system, due both to the tires (and possibly to aerodynamic actions), and the
geometry of the system, starts to become important. The vehicle may start to behave
differently from what the driver expects.

It is difﬁcult for the driver to assess the traction available due to road conditions
and the sideslip angle of the tires, so when the wheels start slipping they do so
abruptly. The feeling the driver has in normal conditions is that of kinematic driving
(the wheels seem not to be at a sideslip angle and the trajectory seems to be deﬁned
by the position of the steering wheels in a geometrical way). When the sideslip angles
increase to values that can no longer be neglected, the driver feel he has lost control

27.4 Assistance Systems for Handling Control

527

of the vehicle. And indeed he has, for the average driver is unable to control the
vehicle when the sideslip angles are large.

Actually, the behavior of the vehicle may change considerably when the sideslip
angles take values beyond the linearity range. From the viewpoint of theoretical study,
it is possible to compute the steady state working conditions using nonlinear models
and then to linearize the equations about those conditions. This allows us to study,
for instance, the stability or manoeuvrability under these conditions (Chap. 25). The
aim of a study of this kind should be to reduce the difference between handling in
limit and in linearized conditions so the driver is able to control the vehicle even
outside the linearity range.

Consider, for instance, a steering input, aimed at putting the vehicle on a curved
trajectory (Fig. 27.4). If road conditions are good, the vehicle moves on its trajectory
in conditions that are far from limit conditions. The sideslip angles are small and the
behavior is essentially that of a linear system (curve a). If road conditions are worse
(or if the driver steers the tires so as to develop side forces that approach the limit)
the sideslip angles become larger and the tires work in nonlinear conditions (curve
b). Control is still possible, but the driver must have a proﬁciency beyond that of an
average driver. Finally, if the road conditions are worse still, the vehicle may rotate
about the yaw axis, but the wheels slip laterally, so that the vehicle can no longer
follow the required trajectory (curve c). The sideslip angles increase in an unbounded
way and the yaw rotation becomes uncontrolled. An alternative outcome is that the
vehicle cannot rotate due to lateral slipping of the steering wheels. It may then go
out of its trajectory with limited, or even small, values of the sideslip angles.

27.4.2 Control Using a Reference Model

It is impossible for the vehicle to maintain a behavior corresponding to what the driver
is used to based on his experience with the linearized response when approaching
conditions close to the limit. However, it is possible to introduce control strategies
giving the vehicle an apparent behavior the user can ﬁnd predictable. This can be done
by building a reference model allowing the response to the control inputs supplied by
the driver to be computed in real time, and by implementing it on a control system that
forces the vehicle to behave as close as possible to the computed results. This strategy
is not new, and is widely used in the aerospace ﬁeld, mainly for ﬂying aircraft that
are particularly difﬁcult to control. The most typical example is the Space Shuttle4:
its aerodynamic conﬁguration was such that controlling it during landing, the most
critical phase of the ﬂight, was extremely difﬁcult. A mathematical model based on
a standard civil aircraft was used as a reference model; it was running on a control
system which corrected the behavior of the spacecraft so that it followed that of the
model, making maneuvering much easier.

Fig. 27.4 Response to a steering input. Curve a conditions far from the limit. Curve b conditions
close to the limit. Curve c conditions beyond the limit

To transfer this strategy to the automotive ﬁeld is not simple, but the advantage
of providing the vehicle with a response the driver is used to is clear. It is also clear
that the model cannot control the vehicle when this is physically impossible, such as
when the driver demands a lateral acceleration higher than that made possible by the
maximum forces the road-wheels contact can exert. The control system must thus
realize when the limit conditions are approaching and warn the driver, or manage the
high slip conditions in the best possible way.

A possible sketch of a control strategy of this type is shown in Fig. 27.5.
If the vehicle used to build the reference model is the actual vehicle used under
the linearized conditions, the control device will perform little work in conditions
far from the limit, and only when the behavior deviates from the linearized behavior
will it be asked to correct the response. If, on the other hand, this strategy is used to
induce a vehicle behavior different from standard operations, the control device will
have to act in all driving conditions.

Only the steering angle δ is sensed in the sketch of Fig. 27.5, but it is possible to
use devices that are much more complex, measuring the driving or braking forces (at
minimum, sensing the position of the accelerator pedal and the pressure in the braking

27.4 Assistance Systems for Handling Control

529

Fig. 27.5 Sketch of a possible strategy based on a reference model to implement lateral control

system), because directional control is much inﬂuenced by longitudinal forces exerted
by the tires. The sensors for the actual behavior of the vehicle may be of a different
type, including not only a yaw velocity and a lateral acceleration sensor, but also
other sensors allowing the slip of the various wheels to be computed as in ABS
systems. Actuators may also be of a different type and corrections may be exerted
using different strategies.

27.4.3 VDC Systems

Acronyms for the devices implementing lateral dynamics control are many, and they
are often trademarks of the various manufacturers, designating systems working with
different strategies. In this chapter they will be referred to under the general name of
Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC).

The simplest way to control vehicle dynamics is to leave full control of the steering
to the driver and performing the control action by differentially braking the wheels
using the existing braking and traction control system, assuming the vehicle already
has ABS and TCS devices.

Assume, for instance, that the control system detects a yaw speed that is higher
than that computed by the reference mathematical model for the measured steering
angle and speed. A situation of this kind, similar to that shown in Fig. 27.4, curves b
or c, may be deﬁned as an excess of oversteer and corresponds to an excessive sideslip
angle of the rear wheels. It may occur for various reasons, such as an underinﬂated
rear tire, low traction at the rear wheels, a center of mass located far to the rear,
driving forces created by a rear wheel drive vehicle, or many other possibilities. To
reduce the yaw angular velocity it is possible to brake the wheels outside the curved
trajectory. In this case, it is expedient to brake the front wheel, both because it is

530

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Fig. 27.6 Differential braking used to correct directional behavior

likely that the front axle still has traction available and because by doing so the
vehicle becomes more understeer. In a similar way, if the yaw velocity is lower than
the computed value, it is possible to brake the rear wheel inside the turn (Fig. 27.6).
Instead of using differential braking, it is possible to have a steering front axle
controlled by the VDC system. This strategy is different from that assumed in the
section on 4WS where the rear steering was controlled directly by the driver along
with the front steering. In the present case, the driver controls the vehicle using the
front steering only, while the rear steering is used to perform corrections aimed at
forcing the vehicle to follow the behavior of the reference model.

Differential braking has the advantage of acting more quickly than rear steering,
because the latter requires not only that the wheels be set at a sideslip angle, something
that cannot occur instantly, but also that the wheels start exerting cornering forces,
something that requires the vehicle to travel a distance equal to the relaxation length.
Nor is the action of the brakes instantaneous, but its characteristic time is lower.

This drawback of controlling by steering particular wheels is not typical of rear
steering, but is present whenever tires exert cornering forces. Another drawback of
this strategy is that any steering control performed on the rear wheels involves a non-
minimum phase system. The control action initially produces a lateral acceleration
in a direction that is opposite to that occurring in steady state. Although this may in
itself be an advantage (non-minimum phase systems are often quicker than standard
systems), it may be felt as a drawback by the driver, who may prefer a vehicle without
VDC.

Instead of using rear steering, or in addition to it, the VDC system may control
front steering, removing it in part or totally from the direct control of the driver.
While the strategies seen above are additional to the usual ways of controlling the

27.4 Assistance Systems for Handling Control

531

vehicle’s course, this method does offer an alternative. If the control system uses a
reference model to perform driver commands, the latter may not even realize that the
control system is overriding his command. He may have the feeling that the vehicle
behaves as expected, which is true: The goal of the driver is to keep the vehicle on the
required trajectory, and it does not matter whether to do so the steering wheels are
set to the angle the driver sets on the steering wheel or the control system produces
a different steering angle, possibly while the brakes act differentially and the rear
wheels steer.

If the vehicle is provided with a steer by wire system, there is no difﬁculty in
removing, in part or totally, steering from the direct control of the driver: It is enough
that the steer actuator not only receives the signal from the sensor measuring the
angle of the steering wheel, but is driven by the controller that acts according to
a more complex logic. However, as it will be seen later, at present (2018) there
are still difﬁculties, included those linked to regulations, in uncoupling the steering
system completely from the steering wheel. It is possible to use a partially mechanical
solution, where the steering mechanism is connected to a differential gear, receiving
an input from the steering wheel through the shaft in a conventional way, along with
the input coming from an electric motor controlled by the VDC system. The steering
angle of the wheels is then a combination of the angle of the steering wheel and that
imposed by the actuator.

Apart from operating the brakes, the rear steering and the front steering, the VDC
system may also operate through the suspensions. If an active anti-roll bar is used,
it is possible to shift the load transfer from the front to the rear axle, or vice versa,
making the vehicle more or less oversteering. This strategy will be dealt with later
when we discuss active suspensions.

Devices of the kind seen above not only affect the driveability of a vehicle and
the feeling the driver gets from it, but may also change its intrinsic stability. While
the steering on all wheels, implemented by controlling the steering boxes of the two
axles using the steering control, has no effect on the stability of the vehicle (although
it may affect the stability of the vehicle driver system), a device in which a closed
loop controller oversees the lateral behavior (like that sketched in Fig. 27.5 or in
Fig. 27.6) may alter it to some extent.

In general, a VDC system may make the vehicle more stable, by making it less
subject to external disturbances, as is predictable for a closed-loop device. If a strategy
based on a reference model is applied, the stability of the vehicle should be brought
to coincide with that of the model, but this must be accurately studied at the design
stage. It must be noted that if the VDC system is designed to operate in conditions in
which the vehicle has a nonlinear behavior (in conditions far from the limit, where
the vehicle is essentially linear, the usefulness of VDC is debatable) both the system
and the controller are nonlinear, complicating the study of stability. This also applies
to cases where the goal of the control device is to make the global behavior of the
controlled system (as seen by the driver) as linear as possible.

Finally, any system controlling the handling of a vehicle has limitations. The
vehicle may remain on the trajectory the driver sets, thanks to the control system,
only until the maximum cornering forces are reached. From this viewpoint, a device

532

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

that changes the behavior of the system so that it remains close to the behavior in
conditions far from critical may be dangerous, because it prevents the driver from
realizing that he is dangerously approaching critical conditions.

If the control system must warn the driver of the approaching of limit conditions,
the controller must be designed so that it changes its control logic when the limit
conditions are reached. If, notwithstanding the intervention of the controller, the
vehicle cannot be kept on the desired trajectory, the device must perform an emer-
gency manoeuvre, quite a difﬁcult thing because also the driver may be trying to do
something similar.

It is unlikely that the control system should have authority to override the driver,
because the latter has information the control system ignores (if nothing else, infor-
mation on the road conditions) and, if the driver is proﬁcient, he may be able to
manage the emergency situation better than any control device. This consideration
may not apply to average drivers, who may panic and react in a completely wrong
way.

Another reason to limit the authority of the controller is to give the driver some
margin to react to a malfunctioning of the device. This consideration may be impor-
tant for present applications, while in the future the authority of the system may
be increased as more experience on these systems is gained. However, it is perhaps
unrealistic to believe that some future stability control system will be built that can-
not be a cause of accidents a particularly good human driver could prevent. We must
probably reason in statistical terms: A system is useful when the number of accidents
it may prevent is larger than the number of accidents it may cause. This criterion is,
however, difﬁcult to implement, because it is impossible to say how many accidents
a vehicle dynamics control system may prevent.

A further point is that the authority of the VDC system may need to be limited to
prevent the driver from feeling that he cannot master his vehicle. An expert driver
may appreciate the feeling of being in complete control and may even enjoy the
nonlinear behavior in conditions close to the limit. For this reason the driver can
be given the option to switch off the VDC system, as he chooses. The vehicle may
have completely different behavior in the two cases, satisfying customers who might
otherwise buy two different vehicles, one for everyday use and one for sport driving.
Finally it would be a mistake to think that modifying the handling of a vehicle using
a control system makes efforts aimed at designing well-handling vehicles useless.
As already stated, it is better to avoid giving too much authority to the control system
for safety reasons, and a failure of the control system that makes the vehicle outright
unstable must be avoided. Moreover, it must be added that the control system is unable
to generate arbitrarily high control forces, leading to limitations to its capabilities.

27.4.4 Simpliﬁed VDC with Yaw Velocity Control

Consider a device controlling the yaw velocity of the vehicle, implemented by
steering the front wheels. The steering angle of the front wheels is then a linear

27.4 Assistance Systems for Handling Control

533

combination, one that can be implemented using a differential gear that has as inputs
the steering wheel and the controlled actuator, of angles δg expressed by the driver
and δc imposed by the control system. A possible implementation of this system is
shown in Sect. 6.1.2 of Part I.

Assuming that the coefﬁcients of the linear combination have a unit value, it

follows that

δ = δg + δc .

Let the reference model be the two degrees of freedom model studied in Chap. 25:

The parameters of the reference model may be chosen with different criteria. For
instance, Yβr , Yrr , ... may be chosen to be equal to the values Yβ, Yr , ... as computed
for the actual vehicle. In this way the control system will be almost inactive when
the vehicle behavior is similar to the linearized model, and the driver will have the
impression that the behavior of the vehicle is what he is used to in conditions of
smooth driving.

Another strategy may be to modify the behavior of the vehicle in all conditions,

giving it, for instance, a neutral steer response. In this case

Nβr = 0, Yrr = 0

If only the yaw velocity r is to be controlled, it is possible to deﬁne an error

e = r − rr .

(27.21)

As an example, a purely proportional controller may be used: It generates a steer-

ing angle δc proportional to the error through a gain k of the controller, yielding

δc = −ke = −k (r − rr ) .

(27.22)

Although a control of this kind is easy to implement (only r must be measured
and rr computed), its performance would be poor, particularly in terms of control
robustness.

An example based on the sliding mode technique is reported in Vehicle Stability

by Dean Karnopp.5

Example 27.1 Consider the vehicle studied in Example 26.4 and apply to it a VDC
system of the type shown above with the aim of making it neutral steer, using a simple
proportional control. Compute the gains of the vehicle in steady-state conditions and
simulate a steering step manoeuvre to put it on a circular trajectory with a radius of
200 m at a speed of 100 km/h = 27.78 m/s.

The behavior of the system may be modelled using an equation of the type

˙z = Az + Bu + d ,

(27.23)

where z is the state vector, the input u can be assumed as

δ = δg + δc

and d is a vector containing the external disturbances and those due to the deviation
from the linear behavior implicit in matrices A and B.

The order n of the model used for the vehicle may be different from the order of
the reference model, which is equal to 2, but in the present case also the former is
assumed to be a model with two degrees of freedom. Thus assume n = 2. Neglecting
disturbances and nonlinearities, d = 0.

If the output of the system is only the yaw velocity, the output equation reduces

to

r = Cz ,

(27.24)

where the output gain matrix C is a row matrix which, if r is one of the states of the
system, has all elements equal to zero and one equal to 1. In the present case, C has
just two elements.

The trajectory curvature gain, the sideslip angle gain and the lateral acceleration

a neutral steer vehicle with the same geometry and front tires.

From the trajectory curvature gain it is clear that the vehicle has an almost neutral
steer behavior, but a proportional control cannot completely compensate for sta-
tionary conditions, as expected. To produce an exactly neutral behavior at least a
proportional integrative (PI) control must be used.

At a speed of 100 km/h the original vehicle, strongly understeer, has complex

conjugate poles. From the model with two degrees of freedom it follows that

Even if a much simpliﬁed control has been used, and no optimization of the gain

has been attempted, the vehicle is stable.

To obtain a trajectory with a radius of 200 m the vehicle without VDC must
have a steering angle δg = 0.0202 rad = 1.159◦, values that coincide with those of
Example 25.4. To obtain the same curvature with the VDC system, the steering angle
must be δg = 0.0115 rad = 0.658◦. The time history of the response is shown in
Fig. 27.7d. The behavior of the understeer vehicle is oscillatory, while that of the
controlled vehicle is not.

27.5 Suspensions Control

Semiactive and active suspensions are not ‘driving assistance’ systems, but they are
dealt with in this section because they rely at any rate on application of sensors,
actuators and control systems to the mechanical components common in automotive
technology and, above all, because the vehicle which have driving assistance systems,
often have also active suspensions.

Performance of passive suspensions (i.e., suspensions made of springs and
dampers) both in terms of comfort and handling is limited and, as stated in Chap. 26,
any improvement of the ﬁrst is often accompanied by a worsening of the latter and
vice versa. The role of damping in the optimization of the handling and comfort char-
acteristics is shown in Fig. 26.17. The ﬁgure is here shown in a qualitative way, with
its scales starting at zero to show the range in which the parameters span (Fig. 27.8).
The curve is the lower envelope of the performance that may be obtained with
passive suspensions, while the zone between the horizontal and vertical tangents
shown in the ﬁgure is the locus of the points deﬁning optimal performance.

Moreover, as stated earlier, the kinematic errors that are present in all types of
suspensions make it impossible to use very soft springs, because they will lead to
larger suspension movements and thus to larger unwanted motions of the unsprung
mass (changes of track, steering and camber angles, etc., with heave and roll motion).
To improve the situation, suspensions controlled by suitable devices have been
studied and sometimes applied in mass produced vehicles. As shown in Sect. 5.3 in
Part I, it is possible to distinguish between semi-active suspensions (Fig. 27.9a) and
active suspensions (Fig. 27.9b, c) depending on whether the control system simply
controls the parameters of the system (usually damping) with limited energy require-
ments, or directly controls the force exerted by the suspension on the sprung mass,
using actuators of a different type that involve a relatively large power consumption.

538

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Fig. 27.9 Quarter-car with semiactive (a) suspension (the damping coefﬁcient c is variable in a
controlled way) and active suspensions with a controlled actuator supplying all the force exerted
between the sprung and unsprung masses with no other mechanical device (b) or with the help of
a spring (c)

The performance of semi-active suspensions lies in Fig. 27.8 on the same curve
shown for passive suspensions, with the difference that while the latter are represented
by a single point, the former may move on the curve when the value of the damping
coefﬁcient is changed. It is also possible to imagine semi-active suspensions where
the stiffness of the spring can also be changed, as in the system in which the attitude of
the vehicle is controlled, shown in the referenced section of Part I. However, devices
of this kind usually require much more power than that needed to control damping.
In the case of active suspensions, it is possible to have performance represented
by points lying below the envelope, in the zone shown in the plot. In the ﬁgure such
a zone is very small, because it has been assumed that the stiffness of the suspension
is the same as that of the passive suspension, but it may be much larger if a fully
active suspension is used.

Another important parameter is the maximum frequency at which the active sys-
tem operates. The practical difﬁculties and the power needed in an active system
increase with increasing frequency. If the suspension must control the attitude of the
vehicle and the frequency at which it works is low, on the order of the frequency of
the sprung mass, the system is relatively straightforward. If the control must oper-
ate at frequencies on the order of the unsprung masses, or even higher, the system
becomes more complicated.

27.5.1 Active Roll Control (ARC)

As stated in the chapter on comfort, roll stiffness is in general too low, and roll
motions are above all too little damped. Adding anti-roll bars solves the problem
only partially, because while limiting the roll angle in static conditions, it makes roll
motions even more underdamped. Anti-roll bars are actually used on one axle only,

27.5 Suspensions Control

539

to increase load shift on that axle and to decrease it correspondingly on the other. In
this way, it is possible to modify the directional behavior, particularly in conditions
close to the limit.

Active Roll Control (ARC) has the advantage of reducing roll on a curved path,
while increasing roll damping or modifying handling characteristics, depending on
the control strategies used, without the drawbacks involved in an increase of the roll
stiffness of the vehicle.

First consider roll in quasi-static conditions. If the center of mass is above the roll
center, as is almost always the case, the vehicle rolls toward the outside of the path.
This is inadvisable both for stability (because the center of mass moves outwards,
reducing the rollover factor—making rollover easier—and increasing load shift) and
for comfort. Moreover, because of the rolling condition, the wheels take a camber
angle that results in camber forces usually directed against the sideslip forces that
bend the trajectory. The last effect depends strongly on the type of suspensions used
and particularly on their camber recovery.

Even if suspensions were inﬁnitely stiff, the subjective feeling of the passengers
when rounding a turn would be that their bodies were inclined outward, because
the local vertical direction is inclined with respect to the true vertical. The actual
inclination of the vehicle body adds to this effect with results that may be detrimental
to comfort, particularly if the lateral acceleration is high.

Roll may be controlled by an actuator exerting a torque between the body and one
or more axles. The simplest scheme is that of an active anti-roll bar. Conceptually,
imagine cutting the anti-roll bar of an axle, for instance, in the middle, and inserting a
rotational actuator exerting a torque. An example of a device of this kind is discussed
in Sect. 6.3.4 of Part I.

With the torsional stiffness of the axle unchanged, the vehicle behaves passively
if the actuator does not work or is locked. If the actuator exerts a torque to rotate
the body back to a position perpendicular to the ground, the effect is an apparent
increase of the roll stiffness because the angle is reduced. But the actual stiffness
does not change nor does underdamping of the suspension increase, as it would if
the stiffness actually had increased.

A ﬁrst strategy is to cancel the roll angle, obtaining an apparently inﬁnite stiffness.
The feeling of lateral tilting of the vehicle is reduced but not cancelled, while above
all the changes of track, steering, camber, etc. due to roll vanish. Because kinematic
errors related to suspensions linked with roll (or better with the static component of
roll) are completely cancelled, handling is improved.

From the viewpoint of mathematical modelling, rigid-body models become more
precise, because the assumption that roll angle is vanishingly small holds exactly.
Often, while applying this strategy, roll is compensated only up to a certain lateral
acceleration. Some rolling toward the outside of the path, although smaller than
usual, is accepted. This may be necessary, because the torque the actuator must exert
increases with the lateral acceleration and may become quite large. Operating in this
way, the roll angle can warn the driver that critical conditions are approaching, but
it is doubtful whether the geometric roll angle may be separated from the apparent
roll angle due to the inclination of the local vertical.

540

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Another strategy is to overcompensate for rolling by inclining the vehicle toward
the inside of the trajectory. The limit condition is deﬁned by aligning axis z with
the local vertical. This option will be discussed later in detail, in relation to tilting
vehicles.

As seen when dealing with two-wheeled vehicles, the roll angle is

(27.30)

There are advantages in both comfort and handling. If the control is precise and
quick enough, passengers do not feel any centrifugal acceleration. In rail transporta-
tion the diffusion of tilting trains is due mostly to comfort, even if the larger radii
of railways when compared to roads cause lower lateral accelerations than in motor
vehicles. On the other hand, the great sensitivity of the organs of human equilibrium
in detecting lateral acceleration allows us to detect a tilt of less than one degree, and
an angle of just a few degrees causes a strong discomfort.

In terms of handling, if roll compensates exactly for lateral acceleration, load shift
is exactly zero and all its effects are cancelled. On the other hand, the effects of kine-
matic suspension errors do not vanish and may be larger, although of opposite sign,
than those typical of conventional vehicles. If the suspensions keep the midplanes
of the wheels parallel to the x z plane, i.e., if

∂γ
∂φ

= 1 ,

the position of the wheels on the ground is similar to that of the wheels of motorcycles.
The strong camber forces then add to the side forces due to sideslip.

The roll angle needed to compensate for the lateral acceleration may be large.
For instance, at an acceleration of 0.2 g the angle is 11◦ while if the acceleration
is 0.5 g the angle is 27◦. While angles larger than 40◦ are needed to compensate
for the lateral acceleration in high performance cars, it is impossible to use this
strategy in racing cars because angles of 70◦ or more would be required. The steady
state torque the actuator must exert may be small even in the case of large lateral
accelerations. The actuator must maintain an unstable equilibrium position If it is
maintained with precision, reacting quickly to deviations, the moment the actuator
must exert is theoretically very small. It is, however, impossible for the equilibrium
condition to be followed instant by instant with a precision sufﬁcient to cancel all
rollover moments, and the actuator may be called on to exert a high torque.

Many studies on tilting vehicles based on active roll control have recently been
undertaken. These were followed by prototypes and even some small scale pro-
duction. The vehicles are mostly narrow, often designed for city use, and can be
considered a synthesis of motorcycle and car. If the vehicle is very narrow it is pos-
sible to reach inclination angles large enough to compensate for lateral acceleration
without the body of the vehicle touching the ground at the inside of the path. Many
of these tilting body vehicles have three wheels.

27.5 Suspensions Control

The simplest model for roll control is the model with a single degree of freedom
described in Sect. 26.6.1 (Fig. 26.36). It is quite a rough model because it neglects the
compliance of the tires and above all because it is impossible to study roll dynamics
separately from lateral dynamics. The equation of motion of a passive vehicle is
Eq. (26.119), repeated here

¨φ + ((cid:4)1 + (cid:4)2) ˙φ + (χ1 + χ2) φ − msghG sin (φ) =

Jx

+ (cid:4)2 ˙αt2

+ χ1αt1

+ χ2αt2

,

where the forcing functions are due to the lateral slope of the road αti at the i-th
suspension. Jx is the moment of inertia about the roll axis of the sprung mass alone.
If two active anti-roll bars exerting a torque Mai (i = 1, 2) are added and if a

generic moment Me is included in the model, the equation of motion becomes

¨φ + ((cid:4)1 + (cid:4)2) ˙φ + (χ1 + χ2) φ − msghG sin (φ) =

If moment Me is due to the centrifugal force on a path with radius R, its value is

Me = mshG V 2

cos (φ) .

(27.32)

Assuming that the moment exerted by the anti-roll bar coincides with that due to
the actuator, reduced to the bar through suitable transmission ratios, the stiffnesses
χi and damping coefﬁcients (cid:4)i are those of the passive suspensions. If the actuator
is controlled by an ideal proportional-derivative (PD) system that uses the roll angle
as error, the moments are

Mai

= −k pi φ − kdi

˙φ ,

where k pi and kdi are the i-th proportional and derivative gains.

As expected, a PI control is unable to compensate for steady-state roll, even if
it is possible to reduce it by increasing the proportional gains. There are, however,
limitations on the values of the gains, mainly for stability reasons.

The steady-state torque the actuators must exert is

kNm/rad, (cid:4)1 = 955 Nms/rad, (cid:4)2 = 716 Nms/rad, hG = 0.5 m. Compute the time
history of the roll angle and of the load shift of the vehicle without active systems
after a step steering input to insert it on a curve with a radius of 200 m at a speed of
100 km/h = 27.7 m/s.

Repeat the computation for a vehicle with an active anti-roll bar at the rear axle,

with a PD controller with k pi = 10 kNm/rad, kdi = 3 kNms/rad.

Add then an integral control with kii = 100 kNm/srad. For computing load shift,

assume a track of 1.3 m on both axles.

Fig. 27.10 Time history of the roll angle (a) and of the load shift on both axles (b) for the three
cases of a passive vehicle and a vehicle with an active anti-roll bar at the rear axle with PD and
PID controller

Because the system is nonlinear, the equation of motion was integrated numeri-
cally. The results are reported in Fig. 27.10a, b for the roll angle and the load shift.
Note that the load shift is larger at the front angle in the case of a passive vehicle,
while the active anti-roll bar displaces it at the rear axle. The high value of the
derivative gain leads to an almost non-oscillatory behavior of the PD system, while
oscillations are caused by the integrative control in the case of PID.

The example is only an indication, because the model is quite rough (even a step
steering input causes the lateral acceleration to grow more gradually) and because
the values of the gains were assumed arbitrarily. In an actual case it would not be
advisable to move the load shift to the rear axle (except for correcting understeer),
because in this way the oversteer characteristics of the vehicle would increase.

Remark 27.1 Up to now it has been assumed that the controller has used the absolute
roll angle as a reference, something that requires the use of an artiﬁcial horizon like
those used on aircraft. If the roll angle is measured with reference to the position of
the axle, the vehicle body tends to follow the transversal slope of the road, while if
the roll angle is measured with reference to the local vertical, a measurement easily
performed using an accelerometer, the vehicle tends to tilt toward the inside of the
bend, as already shown for tilting vehicles.

Example 27.3 Repeat the study of the previous example, using as a reference the roll
angle measured from the local vertical. Owing to the type of input assumed, during
the entire manoeuvre the local vertical makes an angle

The results of the numerical integration are shown in Fig. 27.11a–c for the roll
angle, the load transfer and the torque exerted by the actuators. To avoid too large a
load shift on a single axle, two active anti-roll bars are used, with gains distributed
between the axles in the same ratio as the stiffness of the suspensions. The sum of
the gains on the two axles is, however, the same.

Note that the device with a PID controller succeeds in keeping the vehicle inclined
toward the inside of the path so as to compensate for load transfer, even if the actuators
must exert large torques. This is due to the fact that they must balance the torques
due to the suspension springs, which try to keep the vehicle upright: if the control
system is used to keep the vehicle inclined in the curve like a motorcycle, no passive
stiffness must be put in series to the actuator. If the suspension must be passively
stable with non-working actuators, the suspension springs must be put in series and
not in parallel to the actuators.

Quarter Car with Ideal Skyhook

Consider a quarter car with two degrees of freedom, like that shown in Fig. 26.7b.
A damper located not between the two masses but between the sprung mass and a
ﬁxed point would be needed to damp the motion of the vehicle body in an optimal
way. A model with this conﬁguration, usually referred to as skyhook,6 is shown in
Fig. 27.12a or b. The point to which the damper is attached is ﬁxed in an inertial frame;
the damper substitutes for the conventional shock absorber in the ﬁrst scheme, while
it is added to it in the second.

The frequency response of a quarter car with skyhook is plotted in non-dimensional

the same values of the non-dimensional parameters b = P/K = 4, a = mu/ms =
0.1. The response of the quarter car with skyhook with ζs = 1 is compared with that
of a conventional quarter car with optimum damping (Eq. (26.29)) and to a quarter
car with skyhook plus a damper between the two masses with damping equal to 1/3
of the optimum value.

Fig. 27.13 Non-dimensional frequency response of the sprung mass of a quarter-car with two
degrees of freedom. Non-dimensional parameters: b = P/K = 4 and a = mu/ms = 0.1. The
response of a passive system with optimum damping (ζ = 0.433) is compared with that of a system
with skyhook (ζs = 1) and with skyhook with the same value of ζs plus a damper between the two
masses with damping equal to 1/3 of the optimum value, (ζ = 0.1443)

The ampliﬁcation factor of the unsprung mass is shown in Fig. 27.13a, while the
inertance is reported in Fig. 27.13b. The presence of the skyhook greatly reduces
the displacement and the acceleration at low frequency, while causing a very high,
although not inﬁnite, resonance peak at the resonant frequency of the unsprung mass.
The peak is fairly narrow and in theory can easily be reduced, because when cs tends
to inﬁnity the response tends to 0. It is, however, impossible to increase the damping
of the skyhook indeﬁnitely, with the result that the peak cannot be eliminated with this
conﬁguration. If a damper, even a small one, is added between the two masses, the
resonance peak in the medium frequency range disappears without greatly changing
the response at low frequency.

A skyhook damper of this kind is quite effective in controlling the motion of the
sprung mass, but the control of the unsprung mass is unsatisfactory. The ampliﬁ-
cation factors of the displacement and the acceleration of the unsprung mass are
shown in Fig. 27.14a, b. The skyhook has practically no effect on the motion of the
unsprung mass at frequencies close to its resonance. However, the presence of a
damper between the two masses strongly reduces the displacement and the acceler-
ation of the unsprung mass. In the ﬁgure, the damping of the conventional damper
is quite low, being about one third of the optimum; if it is increased the height of
the resonance peak decreases, disappearing when the optimum value is reached. In
these conditions there is a small increase of the response at low frequency.

548

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Fig. 27.14 Non-dimensional frequency response of the unsprung mass of the same quarter-car with
two degrees of freedom studied in Fig. 27.13

The ideal skyhook is, then, an ideal solution to control the low frequency motions
of the sprung mass, but it is only a reference solution, because it cannot be imple-
mented in practice.

Semi-active Quarter-Car with ‘Real World’ Skyhook

The ﬁxed point where the skyhook damper is attached does not exist in the real
world. This strategy must therefore be implemented using a device located between
the sprung and the unsprung masses. The semi-active solution, based on a damper
with controllable damping coefﬁcient, is shown in Fig. 27.12c and is described in
Sect. 6.3.2. of Part I.

The controlled damper must supply a force

that is

F = −cs ˙zs − c ( ˙zs − ˙zu) ,

Theoretically, it should be possible to implement a device able to simulate the
skyhook simply by modulating the damping coefﬁcient of the damper so that it is,
in each instant, equal to

27.5 Suspensions Control

ceq = cs

˙zs
˙zs − ˙zu

+ c .

549

(27.46)

Actually, even operating in this way, only an approximation of the ideal skyhook
can be obtained because, even if the forces it exerts on the sprung mass are those of
the ideal device, the forces exerted on the unsprung mass are different.

Remark 27.2 Equation (27.46) cannot be implemented by a passive device. When the
equivalent damping coefﬁcient is positive, the device dissipates energy, something a
passive system can do, but when ceq is negative the damper should introduce energy
into the system, requiring an active device to be used.

An approximated but simple solution is to use two different values of the damping
coefﬁcient. One is high, and is used when the equivalent damper simulating the
skyhook must dissipate energy, i.e., when ˙zs and ˙zs − ˙zu have the same sign (their
product is positive). The other is very low, even approaching zero, and is used when
the damper should introduce energy into the system ( ˙zs and ˙zs − ˙zu have opposite
sign, i.e., their product is negative). This method is simple because it only requires a
damper with two different values of the damping coefﬁcient. It may be obtained, for
instance, with a standard shock absorber with suitable valves to control the motion
of the ﬂuid, or by using electrorheological or magnetorheological ﬂuids. The control
is also simple, because it requires only an on-off system, while greater difﬁculties
can arise from the measurement of the absolute velocity of the sprung mass.

Other solutions are based on a linear variation of the damping coefﬁcient with
ratio ˙zs/ ( ˙zs − ˙zu). The damping coefﬁcient is nonetheless set to zero or to a very
small positive value when it should be negative.

An approach of this kind leads to a nonlinear behavior of the system, making it
impossible to make a general comparison between the behavior of this device and
that of other suspensions.

Active Quarter-Car with ‘Real World’ Skyhook

An active system, able to transfer energy to the system, is needed to follow the law
(27.46). As usually stated, a device operating on four quadrants must be used. This
expression comes from the force-velocity plot of the damper: All the conditions in
which a passive system can operate lie in the second and fourth quadrants, i.e., in the
quadrants where force and velocity have opposite signs (if the force is that exerted
by the damper to one of its end points and the velocity is that of the same point while
the other is constrained). An active system may also exert forces with the same sign
of the velocity, in which case it works in all quadrants.

Consider for instance the quarter-car of Fig. 26.7c, where the damper with control-
lable damping is substituted by an actuator operating on four quadrants. By neglecting
the damping of the tires, the equation of motion is

The system is equivalent to an ideal proportional control on the states (velocities
˙zs and ˙zu are two of the states of the system). Clearly, this is an idealized system, both
because the gains are considered as constants and because in practice it is impossible
to measure the absolute velocity of the sprung mass directly. A system of this kind
may be approximated using a state observer.

As predicted, the damping matrix is not symmetrical, because there is no Raleigh

dissipation function able to express the damping of the system.

Consider the quarter-car studied in Figs. 27.13 and 27.14. Because the system is

active, its stability must ﬁrst be checked. The poles of the system are

⎨

⎩

s =

−0.6771 .

All poles have a negative real part, hence the system is stable. One of the poles

has a non-vanishing imaginary part, and the behavior of the system is oscillatory.

The frequency response of the sprung mass (in terms of displacement and accel-
eration) is shown in Fig. 27.15. The response of the quarter-car with a skyhook of
this kind is not essentially different from that with an ideal skyhook.

The frequency response of the unsprung mass is shown in Fig. 27.16. The response
of the quarter-car is in this case much different from that with an ideal skyhook and,
more signiﬁcantly, is unsatisfactory. To solve this problem a larger value of ζ is
needed. Note that damping between the two masses may be supplied by a passive
damper, leaving the active system with only the task of simulating the skyhook.

Quarter-Car with Groundhook

The very concept of skyhook was introduced to minimize the vertical accelerations
of the sprung mass, with no consideration about the motion of the unsprung mass.

quarter-car of Fig. 27.15

It is not surprising, then, that the motion of the unsprung mass is too large and the
corresponding variations of the force on the ground are unacceptable. As said in
Sect. 7.4.1, the variable component of the vertical force on the ground Fz may be
approximated by neglecting the damping of the tire

Fz = −P(zu − h) .

The frequency response in terms of tire-ground force of the quarter-car of
Fig. 27.15 is shown in Fig. 27.17. As can be clearly seen, there is a strong improve-
ment at low frequency, but at high frequency things are much worse.

To minimize the variable component of the force on the ground either the stiffness
of the tire or the deformation (zu − h) must be reduced. To reduce the latter a damper
between the unsprung mass and the contact point with the ground may be ideally
introduced (Fig. 27.18). Using a designation similar to the skyhook, this approach is
usually referred to as groundhook.

It is clear from the ﬁgure that introducing a groundhook is equivalent to increasing
the damping of the tire. Actually, it impossible to do so in an actual situation, and
not only for practical reasons. Because the tire rotates, an increase of c p would cause
an unacceptable increase of rolling resistance, accompanied by a strong heating of
the tire.

Here it is not only the homogeneous part of the equation that is affected: The
forcing function is also changed. Again, this approach is ideal and in practice may be
realized using only the scheme of Fig. 27.12c), where an active or semi-active device
is located between the two masses. If an active system is used, the force exerted on
the unsprung mass is

F = −cg ˙zu .

In this way, not only is an equal and opposite force exerted on the sprung mass,
but the effect linked with the vertical motion of the contact point on the ground is

Because C is not symmetrical, it can be subdivided into a symmetric and a skew-

passive damper with constant damping coefﬁcient and a matrix corresponding to an
active system.

By introducing the mean and the deviatoric values of the damping of the skyhook

the actuator exerts on the sprung mass. A positive value of ζd shows that the sky-
hook effect dominates, while a negative value shows that the system is primarily a
groundhook. For instance, the suspension with skyhook of Fig. 27.15 is equivalent
to a suspension with ζ0 = 0.6443 and ζd = 0.5.

To compare the two control strategies, consider the same quarter car of Fig. 27.15,
choosing a value ζ0 = 0.433, corresponding to the optimal value of the passive
suspension, and two values of ζd , equal to 0.4 and −0.4 (Fig. 27.19). In the ﬁrst case,
corresponding to a skyhook, the performance of the active suspension is better than
that of a passive system for the sprung mass, in a low frequency range. In the second
case (groundhook), on the other hand, performance is improved at high frequencies,
particularly if the unsprung mass is considered.

An active suspension should thus have characteristics similar to a skyhook at
low frequency and to a groundhook at frequencies close to that of the unsprung
mass, something that may be actually implemented if ζd is a function of frequency.
For the quarter car of Fig. 27.19 it is possible to assume a value equal to 0.4 for
m/K = 1 and to −0.4 for frequencies
non-dimensional frequencies lower than ω

Performance is in this case quite good in the whole frequency range both for
the sprung and the unsprung masses. The variable component of the force on the
ground is shown in Fig. 27.21 (the ﬁgure is similar to Fig. 26.13 plotted for passive
suspensions). The strategy seen in Fig. 27.20 is also optimal from this viewpoint.

Example 27.4 Consider the quarter car studied in Example 26.2 (ms = 250 kg;
K = 25 kN/m; c = 2, 150 Ns/m mu = 25 kg; P = 100 kN/m) and add an actua-
tor realizing the control strategy seen above.

Assume that the vehicle travels at a speed of 30 m/s on a road whose surface is at
the limit between zones B and C following ISO standards, and compute the power
spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass and the related r.m.s. value.
Compare the results in terms of comfort with those seen for the passive suspension.

Response to road excitation. The power spectral density of the acceleration of the
sprung mass may be computed as seen in the previous examples. The result is shown
in Fig. 27.22b). The resonance peak is completely cancelled, while at frequencies
close to the resonance of the unsprung mass the active suspension is slightly worse
than the passive. This is due to the groundhook effect, which has been introduced
to reduce the variable component of the force on the ground and thus to improve
handling.

Comfort is, however, much improved, because the r.m.s. value of the acceleration

is

ar ms = 1.11 m/s2 = 0.113 g

about 20% less than in the case of the passive suspension.

Assuming a simple proportional control law, the control loop can be closed simply
by stating that the force exerted by the actuator is proportional to the acceleration of

The dynamic equation of the system is

˙z = (A − BcGC) z + Bd h .

The transfer function for the control force is

(27.64)

If

G = ms,

the ﬁrst row of the closed loop dynamic matrix A − BcGC vanishes, allowing the
suspension to ﬁlter out the road irregularities completely. Such a solution, apart from
problems linked with its practical feasibility, is also impossible from a theoretical
viewpoint, because it would optimize the acceleration of the sprung mass but would
lead to a strong increase of the dynamic component of the force on the ground.

Example 27.5 Repeat the previous example, using a quarter car controlled on the
acceleration of the sprung mass. Look for a gain of the control system that reduces
the r.m.s. value of the acceleration of the sprung mass with reference to the conditions
seen in the previous example (speed of 30 m/s on a road of the same type) without
overly penalizing performance in term of forces on the ground or leading to high
control forces.

First, the r.m.s. values of the acceleration, the force on the ground and the control
force are computed for different values of the gain. The computation is fairly long
but not complicated: The transfer functions can be computed for each value of the
gain through Eqs. (27.63) and (27.64).

Remembering that s = iω, the frequency responses for the power spectral den-
sity of the response can be computed. The required r.m.s. values are obtained by
integrating the latter.

The values so computed are plotted in Fig. 27.23a. A range for the gain between 0
(passive system) and 300 Ns2/ m, was chosen. It includes the value G = 250 Ns2/m,
at which the response in terms of acceleration of the sprung mass vanishes.

The r.m.s. values of the force on the ground and the acceleration were made non-
dimensional by dividing them by the values of the passive system, while those of
the control force were divided by the value obtained for a gain G = 300 Ns2/m.
As predictable, the acceleration decreases with increasing G, but the force has a
shallow minimum to increase again, with a strong increase of the control force. A
good compromise value may be

G = 120 Ns2/m.

With this gain

ar ms = 0.964 m/s2 = 0.098 g, Fzr ms

= 356 N , Fr ms = 223 N .

With respect to the passive solution, the acceleration is reduced by 28% and the

force on the ground by little more than 8%.

The frequency responses of the displacement and the acceleration of the sprung
mass and of the variable component of the force on the ground are plotted in
Fig. 27.23b, while the power spectral density of the acceleration of the sprung mass
and of the forces are reported in Fig. 27.23c, d.

The results show a strong improvement of comfort performance, even if of a
different kind than that plotted in the previous example. In that case, the improvement
was entirely at low frequency where the peak disappeared, while at high frequency
performance was similar, if not worse, than that of the passive suspension.

In this case, the improvement is distributed over the entire frequency range. The
handling performance seems to be essentially unchanged, at least in terms of the
force on the ground. This could be expected, owing to the type of control used.

Final Considerations

Some control strategies for active suspensions were considered in the previous sec-
tions. It must be ﬁrst stressed that this is only a theoretical study, because the strategies

27.5 Suspensions Control

561

that may actually be implemented depend on the actual characteristics of the actua-
tors, sensors and power systems used, and in particular on their limitations in terms
of manageable power and frequency response. Moreover, all solutions considered
are based on a suspension including a passive spring, while the active or semi-active
systems introduce a damping force only.

This solution, often considered because it allows relatively small forces to be con-
trolled, clearly has a basic limitation: The elastic characteristics of the suspension
are those of the passive device from which it derives. The zone labelled as active
suspensions in Fig. 27.8 refers to solutions of this kind. If the stiffness of the suspen-
sion can also be controlled or, even better, if the force exerted between the sprung
and the unsprung mass is completely controllable, performance can be optimized in
a much wider range.

The techniques used are often based on optimal control, with observers used to
estimate the quantities that cannot be measured directly, but the greater difﬁculties
are found not so much in the deﬁnition and implementation of the control algorithms,
but in the implementation and in the optimization of the actuation and power systems.
The models shown above are based on the quarter-car model and assume a decen-
tralized control in which each wheel (or as is often said, each corner of the vehicle)
acts in an independent way. The roll and pitch characteristics of the vehicle come
from those of single suspensions, as was also seen for the passive suspensions. A
decentralized control is often implemented, and the interactions between the suspen-
sions are considered as non-modelled dynamics, as well as other phenomena that
are neglected. As seen in Sect. 27.5.1, roll motions may be controlled independently
from heave motions by using active anti-roll bars. In the same way it is possible to
control pitch motions by connecting the control of the front and rear axis suspensions
in what may be deﬁned as a centralized control, even if solutions of this kind are in
general not yet applied.

Clearly, an actuator in each wheel allows functions like ABS, TCS, VDC, etc. to
be performed without the need of valves discharging the pressure from the branch
of the system in each wheel or of pumps that recover the ﬂuid. The brake in each
wheel is controlled independently following the commands from the driver and the
various control devices.

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

27.6.1 Roadmap to Autonomous Vehicles

A natural evolution of driving assistance devices is to give them an increasing author-
ity, shifting their intervention to higher and higher levels, performing automatically
a number of control functions that at present are entrusted to the driver, and at the
same time reducing the ﬁeld of intervention of the driver.

562

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

The long term goal is that of building road vehicles able to perform all their func-
tions automatically, essentially transforming the driver into a passenger. This goal
is still distant and, as with predictions of the so-called strong artiﬁcial intelligence,
there are doubts about how far it is possible to proceed along this road, at least with
today’s technologies and those likely to be developed in the foreseeable future.

The idea of autonomous driving in itself is not new and in some way has already
been experienced since long time in the history of land transportation. Horse driven
vehicles had a noteworthy degree of autonomy: the animal had a good obstacle
avoiding capability, and was able to carry home the vehicle, or at least to put it
in a ‘safe state’ even in the case the driver was impaired by some unpredictable
circumstance. All low-level decisions and most of the intermediate level ones were
left to the horse, who could even take the high level ones in emergency. Only in
extreme conditions (the chariot races, so popular in the ancient world), the driver
had to actually ‘drive’ the vehicle in the sense we give to this term.

These capabilities were completely lost when mechanical devices, unable to show
the ‘intelligent’ behavior of draw animals, was substituted for horses. The relative
animal intelligence and autonomy was traded for performance, simpliﬁed care, avail-
ability, cleanliness and, as soon as the cost of motor vehicles started dropping, low
cost and affordability of mechanical vehicles. Human drivers had to take on them-
selves the tasks of driving and controlling the vehicle at all levels.

The idea of giving back the driving task to the vehicle, or at least to transfer it
from the occupants of the vehicle to some non-travelling controllers, is old and the
ﬁrst attempts date back to the 1920s: in 1921, Captain R. E. Vaugh demonstrated a
radio controlled car at the McCook Field, Dayton, OH. It was a driverless car, but not
an autonomous one, since it was controlled by a driver travelling in another vehicle.
Other attempts of the same type were performed in the following years, mostly by
the US military.

The interest, however, was not so much in remote controlled, but in true autonomous
vehicles and was mostly motivated by safety: in 1920, the casualities due to road
accidents in the USA were 12,155 and this ﬁgure kept increasing7 until it reached
a value of 37,819 in 1937. Later this ﬁgure had an oscillatory behavior, reaching an
absolute maximum of 54,589 in 1972. Since most of the accidents were ascribed
to human error, the ﬁnal solution of this problem, which was having an increasing
social relevance, was to keep humans away from the control loop of vehicles. The
basic idea was that only a driverless car can be a safe car.

At the end of the 1930s, the solution was thought to be in locating guide wires
under the surface of highways, with the cars following the impulses broadcast by
the wires to actuate both steeering and the on-board speed regulator. An article on
Popular Science made this ideas quite popular in 1938. The idea of radio-controlling
road vehicles was so abandoned in favor of autonomous vehicles controlled by a
crashproof highway. And “Why don’t we have CRASHPROOF HIGHWAYS” was
the title of an inﬂuential arcticle on Mechanix Illustrated in 1953, when the studies

7This is not in contraddiction with Fig. 28.3: the miles travelled by motorists grew in time more
than the number of accidents, so that the number of casualities per mile travelled kept decreasing.

An image from Panorama Magazine, vol. 40, Nr. 5–30, January 1956 is shown in
Fig. 27.24.

The idea of the guide wire was seriously developed for years, with some technical

success and became a reality in low speed industrial and public transportation.

The advances in microelectronics and robotics however allowed research to take a
different direction: displacing the control device from the highway to the vehicle, so
that the latter can take its own decisions instead of following passively the commands
from the road. This made sense not only technologically, but also economically,
particularly in a country like the USA (where most of the research was performed),
which had a large amount of highways with a limited trafﬁc density. The philosophy
of an automated highway could be applied only to a number of main highways
and perhaps to some urban roads—provided that the guide wire could work in city
trafﬁc conditions instead of constant speed travelling, which is at least an uncertain
statement—and travelling in rural areas would have always been performed under
manual control.

Starting from 1978, with the introduction of the ﬁrst ABS systems, on-board
control systems and microprocessors entered the automotive ﬁeld and the idea of
autonomous cars gained credibility. In 1984 Mercedes installed a computer and some

564

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

cameras on a Mercedes 508 D 5 t van—which could carry the heavy electronics of the
time—and demonstrated it could drive autonomously with the only help of cameras.
In the following years many prototypes were built, not only in the USA but also
in Germany, Japan and Italy, and a thorough experimentation started. The big con-
tribution of the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
is demonstrated by its activities to promote the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge for
autonomous vehicles and later the DARPA Urban challenge and other initiatives to
encourage the research in this ﬁeld.

Although the target of having a fully autonomous vehicle is still far, at present

(2019) the research is proceeding at an interesting pace.

The National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a formal clas-
siﬁcation system for automated vehicles. It deﬁnes 5 levels of autonomy, from 0 to
4, based on the capabilities of the vehicle control system and its ability to relieve the
driver of driving responsibility.

Also the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) published in 2014 a classi-
ﬁcation of autonomous vehicles, based on the amount of driver intervention and
attentiveness required. The SAE standard J3016_2014018 deﬁned six levels, from 0
to 5, of vehicle automation; the table is reported integrally in Table 27.1.

The various levels are thus:

• Level 0 (conventional): Fully manual vehicle. Automated systems may issue warn-
ings and may momentarily intervene. The majority of vehicles presently on the
road today belong to this level.

• Level 1 (hands on): One single automated aspect. The vehicle has a single aspect
of automation that assists the driver with ADAS. Examples of this include steering,
speed, or braking control, but never more than one of these.

• Level 2 (hands off): Automated steering and acceleration capabilities. The vehicle
is able to control both the steering and acceleration/deceleration ADAS capabil-
ities. Although this allows the vehicle to automate certain parts of the driving
experience, the driver remains in complete control of the vehicle at all times.
Examples of level 2 include helping vehicles to stay in lanes and self-parking fea-
tures, with more than one ADAS aspect. The driver must monitor the driving and
be prepared to take over at any time.

• Level 3 (eyes off): Environment detection. The vehicle is able to detect the envi-
ronment around it, and contains the lowest-tier system that is classiﬁed as an auto-
mated driving system as opposed to a manual system. With this more advanced
technology, level 3 vehicles can take informed decisions for themselves such as
overtaking slower vehicles. However, unlike the higher rated autonomous vehi-
cles, human override is required when the machine is unable to execute the task
at hand or the system fails. The driver can safely turn his/her attention away from
the driving tasks, but must be prepared to intervene within some limited time.
• Level 4 (mind off): No human interaction required. The key difference between
level 3 and level 4 automation is that level 4 vehicles are able to intervene

themselves if things go wrong or there is a system failure. In this sense, these
cars are left completely to their own devices without any human intervention in
the vast majority of situations, although the option to manually override does
remain in difﬁcult circumstances.

• Level 5 (steering wheel optional): Human driving is completely eliminated. Simi-
larly, level 5 vehicles do not require human attention. However, the key difference
is the quality, with level 5 vehicles providing a much more responsive and reﬁned
service, comparable to that of adaptive and situational manual human driving.
Examples of where level 5 vehicles are suitable include off-road driving and other
terrains that Level 4 vehicles may not necessarily be able to detect or intelligently
comprehend. In other words, level 5 vehicles have a much more advanced environ-
ment detection system. The vehicle that does not require typical driving controls
such as a steering wheel, gas and brake pedals, or other, with the driver eliminated
completely from any control loop.

27.6.2 Applications of Autonomy

At present most of the vehicles are private vehicles, used and directly operated by the
owner or by one of his relatives. The user in most cases leaves the place where he/she
is before using the vehicle (his/her house, working place, etc) and walks to the place
where the vehicle is parked. Then gets on the vehicle, drives to the destination place
and then looks for a parking place as close as possible to the destination. Finally, after
parking the car, he/she walks to the destination. In most cases, the distance driven is
of a few kilometers on urban roads (in the US many travels occur however on urban
motorways and are much longer) but there are cases of much longer travels (even
hundreds kilometers) and occurring on extra-urban roads or highways.

An alternative to owning a car—or just a way to have a car in a place different
from that where the owned car is located—is renting one, for a short time or with
a long-term rental. The use of a rented car is in general very similar to that of an
owned car.

In recent years, however, a new way of using cars has emerged, and is growing:
Vehicles on Demand (VoD). Vehicles are owned by companies, similar to car rental
companies, which rent them for even very short travels. The car is left on the road
(sometimes in speciﬁc parking spaces) by the previous user and the new user ﬁnds
it, or locates it, through an app on his/her smartphone and then gets on board. The
user drives the car to the destination place, parks it in the ﬁrst available parking
place, or perhaps in a speciﬁc parking space, and gets out. The rental cost will be
later charged on the user’s credit card. Actually, apart from ownership, the use is not
much different from that of an owned car.

With autonomous vehicles the way of fullﬁlling the mobility needs, and above
all of using the prerogatives linked with autonomy, are more varied. Following the
different ways of using the vehicle, the needs for autonomy, and thus the technical
speciﬁcations of the vehicle, may be different. Above all, for implementing these

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

567

different mobility performances, it is not necessary to wait that a Level 5 vehicle has
been developed.

The ways of using an autonomous car have been deﬁned as:

• Interstate pilot. This way of using autonomous vehicles only on speciﬁc—and
prepared—stretches of motorways is the modern version of the crashless highways
of the 1940s, with the difference that the guidance is not based on a guide wire,
but on a controller located on board. The motorway must be speciﬁcally prepared,
but this is much less costly than in the old guide wire solution. The autonomy
required is not much higher than levels from 2 to 4, and the driver must anyway
drive himself his car except for the mentioned stretches of highway. However, this
way of robotizing cars may have a deep impact on everyday life, in particular of
those people who do much car travelling, above all for work.
The driver spends a long time on the vehicle and can use this time for other
things, from enjoying the on-board entertainment systems to working (and in this
case things are similar to how people spend their time during air travels) or being
connected through the web and social networks. Although some polls did show that
some people said that it would kill the pleasure of driving, it is questionable that
driving on motorways in present conditions, with speed limitations and sometimes
also heavy trafﬁc, may be considered a pleasure. Certainly in conditions of heavy
trafﬁc and trafﬁc jams it would be quite a pleasure to be able to do something else
than driving.
An important consequence is on the comfort requirements: reading or watching a
screen on a moving vehicle, particularly in conditions with frequent accelerations
and braking, can lead to severe discomfort, at least when riding on low class cars.
It is possible to predict that all cars provided with an interstate pilot should have
a comfort of the level of present luxury car, meant also for managers who travel
with a driver and use their car as an extension of their ofﬁce.
At a lower level of automation (Level 3) the driver may be called to act as a backup
in case of incurring in situations the interstate pilot is unable to deal with. In this
case the problem is the time required by the driver to acquire a sufﬁcient situation
awareness and to take control of the vehicle, a difﬁcult problem indeed.

• Valet parking. The vehicle is driven in the conventional way up to the destination
of the journey. The passengers and the driver get out and the vehicle autonomously
ﬁnds a parking place and parks. When the driver calls the vehicle, perhaps using
his/her smartphone, the vehicle exits the parking place and reaches the preset
meeting point. When on board, the driver resumes his/her driving task. This way
of working is a sort of an extension of the self (or automated) parking function
now commercially available on many car models since a few years. In existing
systems, the driver has to locate the parking spot and to drive the vehicle in an
appropriate position close to it. The automatic system is then activated and the
car completes the manouver autonomously. With the valet parking function, the
driver leaves full authority to the car in a place which may be even quite far from
the closest available parking spot, and the car has to ﬁnd the place to park and
then enter it. The vehicle has thus to be able to travel autonomously in the city

568

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

trafﬁc, with the simpliﬁcation that the maximum speed may be quite low, so that
the behavior of the car can be assumed to be of the kinematic type. If the speed is
very low the implementation may be quite easy, but this may be acceptable only
for travelling within a parking lot or for a short distance in the city center. If the
driver wants to be left in the city center, but the closest parking spot is in a more
peripheral location of the city, a number of cars travelling at such a low speed may
cause an obstacle to the other cars. A similar situation occurs when the driver calls
the vehicle to pick him/her up.

• Fully automated vehicle. This is the ﬁnal goal of automated vehicle, and requires
level 5 automation. The driver can thus use the time spent on his car in a ‘meaning-
ful’ way, and this may be particularly appealing to people who do a work which can
be performed in any place (typically managers, writers, journalists, etc.), but also
people who do not seek to have more time to work may enjoy on board entertain-
ment, remaining connected with their favorite social network, or reading a book.
For these things, particularly reading, the comfort of the car must be high enough
to allow it without causing motion sickness. It must be noted that these systems
transform the driver in a passenger, and seldom passengers of cars read, watch
movies or work in their urban car travels. So perhaps this idea may be wishful
thinking, except for long highway (also urban highway) travels which last at least
half an hour. In the beginning, the technology may require that the driver remains
ready to take control—level 3 and 4—but here remains the problem that he/she
must gain the required situation awareness in a sufﬁciently short time, and this
probably prevents him/her to engage in other activities, at least for level 3.

• Advanced Vehicle on Demand (AVoD). This is similar to valet parking, the differ-
ence being more in the ownership of the vehicle than in its technical requirements.
From one viewpoint it may be more difﬁcult, since the vehicle must be able to
reach the customer from the company parking site, which may be in a suburban
area, but on the other hand it may be easier, because the car may be called to reach
a well determined parking place reserved to the service, and the parking place
may inform continuously the car about where there is a free place, so that the car
doesn’t have to actually look for it. Some analysis have shown that, if in the center
of a city only VoD cars are allowed, the number of cars on the road (most of which
are parked) could be reduced of a factor greater than 10 (that research stated a
factor of 13). This strategy would remove from the road more than 90% of cars,
making it much easier ﬁnding a parking place close to the destination place.
The simplest case is that of a VoD vehicle which is directly driven by the customer
when he/she is on board: the situation is so much similar to valet parking. This
situation may evolve to one in which the customer doesn’t have to drive the car
himself, so that the car is a fully automated vehicle, which would operate like a
driverless taxi. If it is of Level 5, the car can be without steering wheel, pedals and
other controls, making access to the car much easier.

27.6.3 Ethical and Legal Problems

At present, it seems that the ethical and legal problems which must to be solved are
more severe than the technical ones.

Without government permits, testing self-driving cars on public roads is in general
illegal. The Vienna Convention on Road Trafﬁc, stipulated in 1968, states that human
drivers must always remain fully in control of—and responsible for—the behaviour
of their vehicle.

As a consequence, legal problems had to be solved just to start experimenting with
autonomous vehicles, but some administrations in the USA, and some European and
Asian countries, proved to be collaborative. For instance, in the USA 33 states have
agreements to allow self driving vehicles on public roads, and the same applies for
Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Sweden and France in Europe, China, South Korea,
and Singapore in Asia. Other countries are following, so that autonomous vehicle
experimentation is possible in many places.

Apart from these regulatory details, it is clear that the rules set to determine the
behavior of automated vehicles must comply with the ethical standards on which
human behavior is based. Automated vehicles will share the road with human beings
in general and, at least until when all vehicles will be autonomous, with vehicles
driven by humans. If it were possible to build and operate perfect autonomous vehi-
cles, which can prevent any possibility of accidents even if caused by other road users,
things could be simple and just a few common-sense rules—like the three laws of
robotics introduced by Isaac Asimov9—could be sufﬁcient to determine the behavior
of the machine. However, this is not the case, and while autonomous vehicles may
avoid certain types of accidents, they could cause accidents of other types and this in
itself raises philosophical issues. While an approach could be that, as far as the acci-
dents caused by autonomous vehicles are fewer, and with lesser consequences than
the accidents avoided, the introduction of autonomous vehicles is ethically justiﬁed,
even this could be questioned.

Since it is utopian to think that autonomous vehicles could avoid all accidents,
and we must program their behavior so that, in case of an impending accident which
cannot be avoided, the robot controlling the car tries to minimize its consequences,
dilemma situations may arise. Clearly, there is little new in this, since also human
drivers may be called to face these dilemmas, however there is a basic difference:
the human driver is faced by a rapidly evolving situation, which causes a great
psychological stress and cannot be expected to manage the situation in a cold enough
way to take the most appropriate decision, while the robot has a much shorter reaction
time and no emotivity and will follow its programming. No responsibility can be
given to it, and the only responsible persons are the manufacturer of the vehicle, and
speciﬁcally the engineers and the programmers who decided how the vehicle will

9(1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come
to harm. (2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
conﬂict with the ﬁrst law. (3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
not conﬂict with the ﬁrst or second law.

570

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

behave. For sure they do not act under an unbearable psychological pressure and they
can take all the required time to take decisions, so that they cannot be discharged of
their responsibilities in the same way as the driver is.

The idea of returning the decision to the human driver is unfeasible, at least
for Levels 4 and 5 (perhaps also 3): to regain situation awareness may take up to
40 s (imagine that the driver is sleeping) and for level 5 the car may have no human
machine interface.

A classical example of a dilemma situation was given by Patrick Lin10 and is here

reported as described by the same Lin11:

Imagine in some distant future, your autonomous car... must either swerve left and
strike an eight-year old girl, or swerve right and strike an 80-year old grandmother.
Given the car’s velocity, either victim would surely be killed on impact. If you do
not swerve, both victims will be struck and killed;... If you were programming the
self-driving car, how would you instruct it to behave, if it ever encountered such a
case, as rare as it may be? Striking the grandmother could be the lesser evil, at least
to some eyes. The thinking is that the girl still has her entire life in front of her...
while the grandmother has already had a full life and her fair share of experiences.
Further, the little girl is a moral innocent, more so than just about any adult. We
might agree that the grandmother has a right to life and as valuable a life as the little
girl’s; but nevertheless, there are reasons that seem to weigh in favor of saving the
little girl over the grandmother, if an accident is unavoidable. Even the grandmother
may insist on her own sacriﬁce, if she were given the chance to choose. But either
choice is ethically incorrect, at least according to the relevant professional codes
of ethics... Discriminating on the basis of age in our crash scenario would seem to
be the same evil as discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender, disability,
national origin, and so on, even if we can invent reasons to prefer one such group
over another.

This discrimination is forbidden by the constitution of most countries, so that there
are even legal reasons to avoid it. Not taking a choice and killing two people when
one can be saved seems an even worse choice (even if some ethics schools would
suggest that avoiding taking a choice is the only possible choice). Also a random
choice, leaving the decision to chance is as well not a satisfactory solution and even
worse could be to opt for running over the lightest of the two persons, to minimize
the damage to the car and its passengers. This is a dilemma which cannot be solved
easily.

The same Lin makes another example, to widen the discussion beyond just the
accounting of damaging the car can cause: Imagine the car has to chose between two
bykers, one wearing a helmet and the other not. Minimizing the damage would mean
Autonomous Vehicles

571

hitting the byker with the helmet, but once this is know, it will encourage unsafe
behavior, which potentially could cause an increase of casualities on the road.

The dilemmas which could be described are so many that it would be impossible
and even useless to try to enumerate them, but this is not the only aspects of the
problem. No technology is 100% free of mistakes, and a complex technology like
autonomous cars is likely to have a non-negligible malfunctioning rate, particularly
in its early phases. So the reponsibilities for malfunctioning of the autonomous
robotic driver must be clearly stated. And there is also the possibility of a refusal by
the public opinion of adopting this technology, which has in itself the potential of
strongly increasing the safety on the roads.

Other points, along with safety, are also security and privacy. All computers can be
hacked, also those which control an autonomous car. Cars have been used as weapons
in terror attacks, but this may become much easier (and safer, for the terrorist) if done
by hacking an autonomous car. Many other crimes can be performed by hacking an
autonomous car and violations to privacy as well. The computer of an autonomous
car may store a large number of sensitive informations regarding its owner or its
users, so the implications regarding privacy are many.

27.6.4 Simple Models for the Vehicle-Driver System

Before embarking in the study of automatic systems aimed at controlling the vehicle,
it is advisable to study the vehicle driver system in conventional vehicles, where the
human driver is fully integrated in the control loop.

A possible scheme of the vehicle-driver system is shown in Fig. 27.25. The driver
is assumed to be able to detect the yaw angle ψ, the angular and linear accelerations
˙β, ˙r , d V /dt, V 2/R and to be able to assess his position on the road (X and Y ).
Moreover, the driver receives other information from the vehicle, such as forces,
moments, noise, vibrations, etc. that allow him to assess, largely unconsciously, the
conditions of the vehicle and the road-wheel interactions.

The study of the vehicle-driver system has two primary goals:

• To build a mathematical model of a human driver that can be integrated into the
mathematical model of the vehicle in simulations. It is not necessarily true that a
system made of two subsystems that are both stable is itself stable. The study of
stability, therefore, should take into account the behavior of the driver even if the
vehicle is intrinsically stable. Moreover, in the case of motorcycles, the intrinsic
instability of the system makes it necessary to introduce a driver model, at least
as a roll stabilizer, to allow the dynamic behavior of the system to be numerically
simulated.

• To supply guidelines for the design of automatic control systems. Automatic con-
trollers are often inspired by the behavior of the human controller, if for no other
reason than that it is the only available model. Moreover, the performance of
human controllers is better than that expected from automatic devices. Automatic

572

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Fig. 27.25 Simpliﬁed scheme of the vehicle-driver system

control systems must interact with a human controller and supply the latter with
information and sensory inputs that are not much different from those he is used to.

It is clear that stability of the vehicle-driver system is mandatory, but it is not
sufﬁcient to assess the required handling and comfort characteristics of the vehicle.
The greater the stability with free and locked controls of the vehicle itself, the fewer
the corrections the driver has to introduce to obtain the required trajectory. A vehicle
that is stable in β and r requires from the driver only those inputs needed to follow
the required trajectory, but not those needed to stabilize the motion on it.

On the other hand, a vehicle that is too stable may lack the manoeuvrability needed
to cope with emergency conditions or simply to allow sport driving. The amount of
stability must be assessed in each case, taking into account the type of vehicle, the
market target, the traditions and image of the manufacturer.

Usually stability, handling and comfort characteristics of a vehicle are assessed on
the basis of prolonged road testing performed by skilled test drivers. This approach
has the drawback of being in a way subjective, and above all of focusing on the
global characteristics of the vehicle, without giving detailed suggestions on causal
relationships between the construction parameters of the vehicle and its behavior.
It also demands that long and costly road tests be performed and, above all, forces
evaluation of the performance of the vehicle to be postponed to a stage in which
prototypes are available.

The availability of mathematical models for the driver-vehicle interaction has a
number of advantages that are too obvious for a detailed discussion. The difﬁculty of
translating concepts like comfort and user friendliness into mathematical functions

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

573

is a serious obstacle in this study, making experimental and numerical approaches
likely to remain complementary.

A model able to simulate the behavior of the driver must be built for the study of
man-machine interactions. The difﬁculties encountered in such a task are so large
that many different approaches have been attempted. Up to now there is no standard
driver model that can be applied.

The ﬁrst systematic studies were performed in the aeronautical ﬁeld,12 but begin-
ning in the 1970s, a large number of models specialized for the vehicular ﬁeld have
been published. A quick bibliographic scan identiﬁes more than sixty models pub-
lished in less than 25 years. These span from simple constant-parameter single-input
single-output linear models to multi-variable, nonlinear, adaptive models or models
based on fuzzy logic and/or neural networks.

As always, the complexity of the model must be chosen in a way that is consistent

with the aims of the study and the availability of signiﬁcant input data.

27.6.5 Simple Linearized Driver Model for Handling

As previously stated, the driver may be thought of as a controller receiving a number
of inputs from the vehicle and the environment and outputting a few control signals
to the vehicle. Under manual control, the driver performs the tasks of the sensors, the
controller, the actuators and the source of control power, even if his control actions
may be assisted by devices such as power steering or braking.

In building a simple driver model, a small number of the inputs the driver receives
is selected and simple control algorithms are chosen to link them with the outputs. The
latter are usually only the steering angle δ and the position of the accelerator/brake
pedals. Only the former is considered if the driver model is used in connection with
a constant speed handling model.

The simplest driver model is a proportional linear tracking system reacting to the
error ψ − ψ0, where ψ0 is the desired yaw angle, with a control action in terms of
steering angle δ proportional to the error. Because the controller has a delay τ , this
means

δ(t + τ ) = −Kg[ψ(t) − ψ0(t)] ,

(27.65)

where Kg is the proportional gain of the controller. By developing function

δ(t + τ )

in Taylor series about time t and truncating the series after the linear term, it follows
that

τ ˙δ(t) + δ(t) = −Kg[ψ(t) − ψ0(t)] .

(27.66)

12See, for instance, D.T. McRuer, E.S. Crendel, Dynamic response of human operators, WADC
T.R. 56–524, Oct. 1957.

574

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Equation (27.66) is only an approximation, yielding results that are increasingly
inadequate with increasing delay τ . In the present case, it is possible to assume that
the values of the delay range between 0.08 s for a professional driver to more than
0.25 s for an occasional driver. Consequently, Eq. (27.66) may lead to non-negligible
errors.

The transmission ratio of the steering system must be introduced into the gain Kg,

because δ is the steering angle at the wheels and not at the steering wheels.

The simplest handling model that may be coupled to the driver model is a rigid-
body model that, assuming that the vehicle is neutral steer, reduces to a ﬁrst-order
system (Eq. (25.108a))13:

Jz ˙r = Nr r + Nδδ + Mze

For the system to be stable, the driver must react quickly (with minimal delay) and
gradually (small value of the gain). These requests become more demanding with
increasing speed. If the delay τ (or better τ (cid:4)) is given, a single condition for stability
in terms of Kg (or better K (cid:4)

g) can be written,

by Eq. (27.66) steers it along a standard ISO lane change manoeuvre at 80 km/h.
Assume a delay τ = 0.1 s and a value of the gain such that the system is stable but
not overly oscillatory.

578

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Plot the root locus of the vehicle-driver system for various values of the speed and
compute the trajectory obtained through numerical integration of Equations (27.66)
and (27.81). Repeat the computations for a delay of 0.3 s.

The ISO lane change manoeuvre, intended to simulate overtaking, was described
in Part III. It requires the vehicle to travel for 15 m in the original lane, to change
lane with a lateral displacement of 3.5 m in 30 m, to stay in this lane for 25 m and to
return to the original lane in 25 m. The manoeuvre must be performed at 80 km/h.
The lane changes may be performed using any trajectory, provided that none of the
cones delimiting the three straight lanes are touched. The width of these lanes are,
in meters, 1.1 B + 0.25 for the ﬁrst lane, 1.2 B + 0.25 for the second and 1.3 B +
0.25 for the third, where B is the width of the vehicle. If the vehicle is 1.56 m wide,
the three lanes are then 1.966, 2.122 and 2.278 m wide, leaving a margin of 0.203,
0.281 and 0.359 m on both sides of the theoretical trajectory.

The actual lane changes are left to the driver. In the present simulation, a cosine
function is used, which has the advantage of being simple and the drawback of
yielding a discontinuity of curvature at each transition with a straight path.

The value of τ (cid:4) corresponding to τ = 0.1 s, computed using Eq. (27.79), is

Remark 27.3 It is, however, uncertain whether it is worthwhile to introduce a more
realistic vehicle model when the driver is modelled in such a rough way. An approach
of this type is too simple to produce realistic results. The lack of a predictive action
and the assumption that the driver reacts only to the yaw angle leads to a reduced
overall stability.

Remark 27.4 The only interesting result of this model, although quite obvious, is
that, to avoid instability, driving must be quick, i.e., with a limited delay, and smooth,
i.e., with a low gain.

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

27.6.6 More Realistic Models of a Linearized Driver

The delay is usually assumed to be the sum of three different delays: the ﬁrst due to the
reaction time, i.e., the time needed for the driver to elaborate the information coming
from the vehicle and the environment; a neuromuscular delay, the time needed for
the command to reach the muscles involved in the control action; and an actuation
delay, due to the time needed to actually perform the control action. Some models
consider the three delays in distinct ways, and also factor in any predictive action the
human operator can perform. Experience shows that such predictive action, which
can be much improved with training, is of paramount importance in actual driving
conditions. A simple open loop transfer function of a linearized driver is

where y, u, Kg, TL , τ , TD are respectively the output and the input of the driver, the
gain, the prediction time, the reaction time and the neuromuscular delay.

In many cases, the prediction time is neglected and all the delays are added together

in a single delay τ , yielding a simpler open loop transfer function

y(s)
u(s)

= Kg

(1 + TL s)e−τ s
1 + TDs

,

y(s)

= Kge−τ s .

By expressing the exponential as a power series and truncating it after three or

two terms, its expression reduces to

y(s)
u(s)

≈ Kg

1 + τ s + 1

2 τ 2s2

1
1 + τ s

.

The last of these expressions corresponds, in the time domain, to the already seen

expression

τ ˙y(t) + y(t) = Kgu(t) .

(27.86)

The choice of which inputs to consider is a delicate one. The results are different if
a quantity linked to the position, such as coordinates X and Y or, better, the deviation
from the required trajectory, or the yaw angle ψ is used.

It is a common experience that a snaking trajectory is obtained when the driver
uses as a reference a point close to the front end of the vehicle, as when driving in
the fog looking at the curb, while the oscillations disappear when the reference point
is far in front of the vehicle.

A simple way to incorporate a kind of predictive behavior into the model is that of
using as error not the difference between the desired and the actual value of the yaw
angle, but the distance d between a point on the vehicle x-axis at a given distance L
in front of the vehicle and the required trajectory (distance d in Fig. 27.29a).

where y is the lateral displacement of the vehicle, i.e., the integral of the lateral
velocity v. If the speed of the vehicle is constant, with the usual linearization, it
coincides with the integral of β, multiplied by V . Angle ψ1 is the angle between the
X -axis and a line passing through two points of the trajectory at a distance L; it may
be easily computed from the shape of the trajectory.

By using the linearized expression for the delay seen above, the equation express-

ing the time domain model of the driver is then

Example 27.7 Repeat the simulation of the previous example using the driver model
of Eq. (27.88).

The values of the time delay, the gain and the prediction distance L are assumed

to be, respectively, 0.20 s, 0.25 and 30 m.

The trajectory is shown in Fig. 27.30b. The driver model is now successful in
performing the required manoeuvre. The tendency to oscillate about the required
trajectory is much reduced, and the driver is successful in anticipating the required
correction.

Remark 27.5 Both models here described are a drastic oversimpliﬁcation of actual
human behavior, but the second performs satisfactorily in many instances. In partic-
ular, the results obtained in the previous examples were based on a trial and error
deﬁnition of the characteristics of the driver that satisﬁed the requirements of the par-
ticular case studied. To obtain acceptable results in different manoeuvres, a further
adaptation of driver parameters would be needed. To perform simulations of more
practical value, more sophisticated models are needed.

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

27.6.7 Sensors for Autonomous Vehicles

Modelling the vehicle driver system, as attempted in the previous section, is very
difﬁcult owing to the complexity of human behavior. When dealing with autonomous
vehicles the complexities of the human behavior have not to be modelled and, from
this viewpoint, the model is much simpler. The complexities are moved from the
attempt to describe a biological system, which is still in large part unknown, to
designing a mechatronic system made of sensors, power electronics, microproces-
sors, actuators and the related software.

As a ﬁrst point, the sensors which allow the vehicle to detect obstacles and, more

generally, to build a model of the environmet surrounding it, must be designed.

The majority of these sensors (shown in Fig. 27.31) are already used by driving
assistance systems. The point with autonomous driving is more the interactions of the
large quantity of sensors, than the use of each one of them. For instance, ultrasonic
sensors and cameras are used for parking assistance or for trafﬁc sign recognition
in many vehicles just for alerting the driver of the closeness of obstacles or for the
presence of speed limits.

vehicle. b Fields of view of some of the sensors

586

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

Owing to the large quantity of sensors required, the point is usually not so much
the choice of which sensors are better suited for the various tasks, but which type of
sensor, or sensor combination, will provide the required performance at a reasonable
cost.

In analogy with our own sensory systems, the sensors of an autonomous vehicle

can be subdivided in

nents,

• proprioceptive sensors: sensors receiving signals from the vehicle and its compo-

• exteroceptive sensors: sensors receiveing signals from the environment.

The former include the engine tachometer, the encoders measuring the position and
the velocity of the wheels, and a myriad of sensors which detect the state of the
vehicle, down to the simple devices which detect whether the doors are open or
closed, etc. An information which is essential to both the human driver and the on-
board computer is the vehicle speed. Traditionally this is obtained directly from the
speed of the wheels, something which is subject to non-negligible errors owing to
their longitudinal slip. Modern cars integrate the information about the speed of all
wheels and sometimes also that from the GPS to supply a much more accurate value
of the speed.

Any modern car has tens of such sensers, even if it is not an autonomous vehicle,
and most of them just switch on a warning light or is connected to a dial which
gives the driver a speciﬁc information (fuel level, engine speed, etc.). Clearly these
information must be supplied to the on-board computer, together with many others
which are essential for the driving robot. For instance, in Fig. 27.25, among the
feedback signals there are the yaw velocity ˙ψ and the acceleration d V /dt, which in
normal cars is directly assessed by the driver. Driving assistance systems, like VDC
or ABS need to know their values and thus need a speciﬁc sensor (a rate gyro or a
set accelerometers for the ﬁrst and an accelerometer for the second) which supply
the relevant information to the microprocessor. The computer which drives the car
needs also to know the values of these quantities, so must receive information from
these sensors. It must be clearly stated that the human driver is able to unconsciously
evaluate a good deal of information about the vehicle state; the human sensibility
must be substituted by a number of sensors in an autonomous vehicle. Another point
is that the precision of these sensors may be much higher than that with which
the human driver can make his/her assessements and thus the driving quality of the
driving robot may well be higher than that of a human—at least of the average human
driver.

Most proprioceptive sensors are now single chip sensors, based on Micro Elec-
troMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, and thus their cost is very low: they
can proliferate and it is reasonable that future autonomous cars can have hundreds
of them, so that the driving computer can be aware of all details of the state of the
car. In many cases they must be redundant, which implies (at least) triplicating the
sensors (Triple Modular Redundancy, TMR), so that the failed one is outvoted by
the others, to ensure the required safety.

27.6 Autonomous Vehicles

587

Some sensors can be wireless, i.e. do not need a physical connection with the
computer which elaborates their signal. This may be an important feature because the
large number of sensors leads to a correspondingly large number of cables reaching
all the zones of the vehicle.

Exteroceptive sensors include set of sensors based on different principles. In

general we can distinguish between:

• cameras,
• GPS based sensors,
• radars, long range and short/medium range,
• LIDARs,
• ultrasonic sensors.

Typically, cameras constitute the heart of most automotive sensing systems,
enabling images in the full 360◦ ﬁeld-of-view of the vehicle’s surroundings to be
acquired. This in a way mimics the way human drivers perform their task, mostly
based on the vision sense. At any rate the images from the cameras must be elabo-
rated by a computer so that machine vision algorithms can distinguish the various
objects in their ﬁeld of view. By elaborating the image, the computer can also read
the trafﬁc signs, so that the information about speed limits and other prescriptions
can be acquired. Binocular cameras are also used to measure distances of objects
within the ﬁeld of view.

Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are sometimes used in the automotive ﬁeld: they
are camera systems which measure distances measuring the time-of-ﬂight of a light
signal between the camera and the subject for each point of the image. The artiﬁcial
illumination may be provided by a laser or by an LED. Laser-based time-of-ﬂight
cameras belong to a broader class of scannerless LIDAR, in which the entire scene
is captured with each laser pulse, as opposed to scanning LIDAR systems which
operate point-by-point.

GPS systems allow to detect the position of the vehicle with good precision and
thus to locate the vehicle on a pre-loaded map of the area in which the vehicle
is travelling. By comparing the positions in different instants, they also allow to
compute its velocity. If the precision is good enough, it is even possible to compute
the sideslip angle of the vehicle, an important information which is quite difﬁcult to
acquire otherwise.

If it is possible to be sure that the map is accurate and updated, additional infor-
mation on such things as trafﬁc signs, speed limits, etc. can be desumed from the map
and compared with similar information obtained directly by elaborating the images
taken by the cameras.

Long-Range Radar (LRR) systems in the 77 GHz band are employed to detect
obstacles in front of the vehicle. They can track high-speed objects, such as oncoming
vehicles and are already used as a part of ACC systems. Also Short (and medium)-
Range Radar (SRR) systems, working in the 24 GHz band, are usually employed for

588

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

detecting vehicles coming from the side and from the rear providing detail about
moving objects nearer the vehicle. In particular, they cover the blind spots of the
mirror, which is very useful also in non-autonomous vehicles to help the driver.
Radars are essential in autonomous vehicles since they supply information on the
quickly changing environment in which the vehicle moves, detecting obstacles and
supplying very precise information about their distance.

Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) systems are used to deliver real-time 3D
data with up to 0.1◦ vertical and horizontal resolution with up to a 300 m range and
360◦ surround view. LIDAR systems can capture a dense point cloud of 3D data
from both ﬁxed and moving objects. A LIDAR can be located on the roof of the car
in a rotating turret which can scan thorugh a 360◦ angle. They are complementary
to radar systems, which emit and receive radio waves rather than light, because the
latter can also be used to provide data on the velocity and bearing of objects which
have low light reﬂectivity, and also to cameras. Having sensors based on different
principles is also essential because in poor environmental conditions, like rain or
fog, and in different light conditions (night and day) they change their performance
to different extents. For instance, LIDAR based sensors can provide good resolution
about the position but their accuracy strongly reduces in poor weather. On the other
hand, the spatial resolution of a radar sensor is relatively poor compared to LIDAR
but provides better accuracy in bad weather conditions. Also, unlike a LIDAR sensor,
a radar can provide information about the velocity and bearing of the object. Laser
data is also more computationally intensive because a laser sends lots of data about
each individual laser point of range data, which must be processed.

Ultrasonic sensors provide detailed information on obstacles close to the vehicle,
and are mostly employed in parking manoeuvre. They are already installed in all
vehicles provided with parking assist devices.

Since each one of the sensor types seen above has inherent technical limitations
and strengths, they are complementary with each other. This is exactly the way we
use our own senses, but in case of machines the fusion of the sensor data is still
one of the unsolved problems in artiﬁcial intelligence. First of all, dealing with so
many sensors means dealing with a huge volume of data. But It is not just a matter
of quantity of data: the sensor readings must be aligned spatially, geometrically and
temporally prior to processing them to create a large single sensing system. The time
history of the data from the sensors must be taken into account, not just their instant
values. The most common algorithm used in position and tracking estimation are
based on the Kalman ﬁlter.14

27.6.8 Public Acceptability of Autonomous Vehicles

An important point which must be clariﬁed is the possibility of a general acceptance
of autonomous vehicles by the public. Certainly the very idea of vehicles which
do not need a driver have the potentiality to deeply change the way people move
around and the very perception we have of mobility and of motor vehicles. This
has been understood by car manufacturers and other companies which started to be
involved in this type of research to the point that many classical auto makers are quite
conservative on this issue, while companies of the high technology sector (Apple or
Google, for instance) are much more willing to be deeply involved and to have their
brand identiﬁed with autonomous mobility.

The question often is: to what extent are individuals ready to use fully-automated
vehicles, and to what extent are we, as a society, prepared to accept a transportation
system with fully automated vehicles on the road?

This issue has stirred much interest in the public opinion, and a large number of
people has at least heard of this possibility, even if many express their skepticism
on the subject. The acceptance of this opportunity is linked with the more general
acceptance of technology, which is varied both regarding the people involved and the
technology which is to be accepted. The result may span from a widespread refusal,
as in the case of nuclear energy or, even if to a lesser extent, of genetically modiﬁed
crops, to the enthusiastic, and sometimes acrytical, acceptation of smart phones, the
world wide web and social networks.

The acceptability of a new technology is linked to the perception of the risks and
beneﬁts, which is largely subjective, depending on the age, the profession, the general
political—ideological bias, previous experience, level of instruction and social status,
etc. of the person expressing his/her orientation.

Moreover, the problem is also about who is taking the risks (and whether people
take the risk in an active way—like riding a motorcycle, engaging in extreme sports,
or just accept in a passive way a risk decided by someone else (like risks linked to food
additives in a situation in which people has little information or possibility of choice)
and who will enjoy the beneﬁts. Most of the people who are against nuclear energy
or genetically modiﬁed crops feel that in front of a risk for the whole population,
the adavntages go to a small elite or to some companies like energy producers or
Monsanto. This feeling is accompanied by a basic mistrust in adequate control and
monitoring by the organism which should vigilate on public safety. The acceptance
of cell phones, after many initial perplexities, or the internet, is due to fact that most
people enjoys using them and, in front of a personal advantage, they willingly take
a risk they feel to be, after all, small.

The risks which are mentioned are about the safety of an autonomous vehicle—
whether it is possible to build an autonomous vehicle which can actually avoid
accidents better than a human driver—and also its security against hacking. In both
cases, many think that autonomous vehicles will show the same problems they are
used to with computers. Mistrust and skepticism is either related to the technical
development in itself or to the actual possibility of perfecting this technology. Other

590

27 Driving Assistance and Autonomous Vehicles

risks which may be perceived are linked with a change of the industrial panorama,
with the possibility for some people to incur in ﬁnancial losses or to lose their job.
This can be linked with both a failure to achieve the proposed goal, with the large
investments on autonomous driving causing the crisis of some automotive brands, or
to a success causing a displacement of investment from an industrial sector to another
one. Owing to the pervasive character of the automotive and related industries in our
society, such a big change will surely affect the labor market: some jobs, related to
the manual operation of vehicles, like taxi driver, will enter a deep crisis, while new
jobs in the control and monitoring of autonomous trafﬁc could emerge, and highly
qualiﬁed personnel would be needed in the development, testing and manufacturing
of the systems.

New risks regarding privacy will emerge, but perhaps they will not be as severe
as those linked with the widespread use of smart phones and electronic booking
and payment systems. A large diffusion of autonomous vehicles will cause a gen-
eralized loss of driving skills but this may not be felt as a general problem more
than the loss of many skills made obsolete by the diffusion of ICT technologies. It
may become a concern only in case the whole system is likely to be disrupted by
malfunctioning or by malicious action of some hackers or terrorists and people will
be called to resume their driver functions. This will be another vulnerability of our
society, and perhaps much less severe than that linked with the banking system, the
communication system, etc.

Apart from risks, many see as a disadvantage to have to give up the fun of driving,
the individual freedom granted by taking decisions (at every level) without having to
share the responsibility with anyone else (human or mechanical) and the feeling of
being directly in control of the situation. Here the problem may be not so much about
who drives the car but who owns the car. For many people, the car is an extension
of their home, a private space in which to take refuge in a stressed life. In this way
of thinking an owned autonomous car may be very similar to a standard car, and
the robot driver may be looked at with friendly feelings, like in western movies the
horse was regarded. On the contrary, in this case there may be an opposition against
VoDs, which retain the stress of driving, taking away the ‘private space’ aspects, and
consequently also against autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD).

It must be remembered that in some cultures (like the Japanese culture) robots are
seen with friendly eyes, while in other cases (often in Europe) the anti-technological
feelings cause a rejection of robots (the so-called Frankestein syndrome).

However, several studies suggest the diminishing role of automobiles relative to
other products such as smartphones, at least for young customers. Young drivers
between 19 and 31, in particular, often ﬁnd driving to be burdensome—speciﬁcally,
driving can stop them from pursuing activities they feel as more important, mean-
ingful or interesting: “Regulation keeps trying to say texting is distracting to driving
but for the consumer it is really the driving that is distracting to texting15”. The same
users are less interested in car ownership and, in fact, VoD services are more popular

among young drivers than those belonging to previous generations. These are symp-
toms that autonomous vehicles may be more popular with young generations than
with older customers.

On the side of the advantages, there is a widespread consciousness that most
accidents occur due to human error, so that excluding humans from the control loop
will increase safety. The controversial point is whether this effect will prevail on
the danger of malfunctioning due to the increased complexity of the system, and
to the introduction of new and unproven technologies. The mobility of people with
disabilities and with reduced capabilities at driving, like the elderly, will be drastically
improved.

Another advantage is that the time spent travelling can be dedicated to activities
other than driving. This may be important, but requires an improvement of the comfort
of vehicles. Reading on a moving car may cause motion sickness, and, even if to
a lesser extent, concentrating on the images on a screen may have the same effect.
Actually, at present, most passengers of cars just listen to music or enjoy the landscape
and it is likely that in an autonomous vehicle also the person who has been freed
from his duties as a driver will do the same. Some persons could use the time so
‘saved’ to use the telephone, the internet or social networks for pleasure or work; but
this has also its drawbacks. Some people interviewed on this subject objected that
one of the advantage of manually driven cars is to allow people to have some time
free from the duty—mostly a self-imposed duty—to answer e-mails and to always
concentrate on work. This would be lost with autonomous vehicles of level 4 or 5.

Perspectives of Future Evolution

28.1 A Need for a Change?

In the last 60 years the dominant model for mobility, and particularly for urban
mobility, has been based on privately owned motor cars, where with this term we
mean a four-wheeled vehicle propelled—in their largest majority—by an internal
combustion engine operated on oil-derived fuels and fully controlled by a human
being (mostly the owner of the vehicle or one of his close relatives) and built following
very strict rules regarding safety, air pollution, etc.

This model, which developed in the Western World, diffused to the whole planet

as soon as the economy of the various countries grew enough to allow it.

At the same time, a similar model developed for land transportation of goods, with
an increse of road transportation and a decrease of the use of freight trains. Most of
the goods at present travel on roads using trucks and tractor-trailer rigs.

The advantages of this model are clear: on one side, it granted humankind a
freedom of movement—in many cases we should speak of freedom tout-court with
many people regarding their car like an extension of their home, and enjoying in it
a feeling of privacy they can never feel using any other means of transportation—it
had never enjoyed, and on the other side it forced to develop a related economy to
build the vehicles, to repair them, to build the infrastructures, to extract, reﬁne and
distribute the fuel and to provide a host of related services (insurance, ﬁnance, selling
and maintnance, etc.) which stimulated the world economy for almost one century,
creating hundreds million jobs and allowing to improve the lives of billions people.
Clearly this model is not completely free of problems, from the still high number
of casualities due to road accidents to the air pollution caused by the combustion of
fossil fuels, from the production of greenhouse gases due to the same reason, to the
trafﬁc congestions the large number of vehicles—so due to the low occupancy of
vehicles for most of the time—causes, from the distress caused in many drivers by
the conditions far from optimal which are often encountered on everyday roads to
the loss of working hours caused by slow trafﬁc conditions.
Perspectives of Future Evolution

In the last half a century some of these problems were put under close scrutiny
and increasingly strict laws have been passed in all countries, in particular regarding
safety and pollution.—mostly air pollution. Other laws regarding the reduction of
fuel consumption, and consequently the emission of greenhouse gases, have recently
been passed and will be made more strict in the future.

But some of these problems are still there, in particular those linked with urban
transportation and to the resulting trafﬁc congestion: in spite of the fact that a well
known manufacturer advertises its products with the slogan Sheer driving pleasure,
the number of drivers who can deﬁne ‘a pleasure’ their experience at the wheel
is decreasing, at least speaking of driving on public roads—motorsports practiced
on suitably built racing tracks is a different thing. Also, one of the fundamental
performance index of any transportation means, the average speed at which the
transporation takes place, has stopped increasing for motor vehicles since a lot of
time, due to strict speed limitations imposed on public roads ﬁrst for decreasing fuel
consumption and then for alleged safety reasons. Here the problem is not so much
the decrease of the mentioned pleasure of driving—which would imply driving at
the speed the driver responsibly feels is more suitable in the given conditions, but
above all the decreased efﬁciency of the tranportation, which should be measured as
the number of passengers transported at the unit distance in the unit time (measured,
for instance, in passenger × km/s).1

This set of problems has suggested some people to put in question the very model
on which road transportation is based: privately owned four-wheeled vehicles pro-
pelled by internal combustion engines and controlled by human drivers. The ideas
that our way of providing mobility for most people are basically wrong, are not
uncommon; these views are voiced strongly by a motivated and determined minor-
ity. These ideas are motivated by a variety of ideologies and political, economical
or ethical beliefs, from sheer antitechnological feelings to the fear that the present
way of providing mobility damages the environment, from the idea that our mobil-
ity system is based on the exploitation of a part of humankind to the belief that it
dehumanizes our lives.

These doubts can be synthetized in two questions:

• is the way we provide mobility wrong?
• is the way we design vehicles wrong?

While the ﬁrst deals with political choices and has much more to do with the
values we believe in than with the technical choices designers have to make in their
everyday life, the second point is of a more technical nature and must be dealt with
when speaking of the future of automotive vehicles.

1A similar problem is affecting since decades also air transportation, with the decrease of aircraft
speeds with the goal of reducing fuel consumption. This is mostly due to the decrease of reasearch in
civil aviation, and the new research programs aimed to build efﬁcient and silent supersonic airliners
promise to solve this problem—which could be deﬁnitely solved only by hypersonic spaceplanes.
On the contrary, high speed trains allowed an improvement of the efﬁciency of rail transportation,
which on medium distance tralvels from city center to city center are now competitive with air
transportation.

28.1 A Need for a Change?

595

On the issue of how cars are designed almost all people who use cars, at least
occasionally, has his or her own opinion. We are all self-appointed experts in car
technology, like all sports enthusiasts are self-appointed coaches for their favorite
team. The authors remember a bumper sticker popular in the United States in the
1960s, saying ‘made in Detroit by idiots’. Those who went around with this sticker
were trying to show their strong dissent from the way motor cars were designed and
built. This may seem just a joke, but these feelings are more widespread than what
motor vehicles experts think and may inﬂuence as well professionals of disciplines
that affect the automotive industry, like architects, city planners, etc.

Car design (in its wider meaning, including also the design of the technologies,
tools and equipment to build them) is a complex business. Not only is it difﬁcult
for the user or in general the layman to understand why a certain design choice has
been done, but often, owing to specialization, it is also difﬁcult for experts in the
automotive industry to have clear ideas about the decisions taken by other experts
in different branches of the same industry. Nobody can be deep in all specializa-
tions involved, from mechanical engineering to electronic engineering, from ﬂuid
dynamics to thermodynamics, from materials science to stress analysis, and so on. If
also economics and business, public relations and management are considered, the
spectrum of know-how needed to build a successful car is so wide that only well
organized multidisciplinary teams may have the knowledge that can cope with the
task.

So, if the way we design cars is wrong, or at least if we can do much better,
hopefully the cars of the future can be more intelligent, and thus more or less dif-
ferent from what we now have. In the following sections some of the most common
criticisms of the way we build cars are brieﬂy analyzed, accompanied by discussions
of the type of vehicles we expect our ways to lead to. Some changes to road vehicles,
more radical than have been predicted in the past, are dealt with, to see whether they
were just fantasies of the past or may become a reality in a more or less distant future.
Apart from the ownership of the vehicles—at present there is a strong debate
between use and ownership of vehicles, in particular about Mobility on Demand
(MoD) services—and the number of wheels—no particular conﬁguration study was
ever made, and the four wheels conﬁguration is inherited from the animal traction
vehicles—the main points are the use of internal combustion engines and the fact
that the driving task is entrusted to a human being.

Not only internal combustion engines are being the object of much research work
aimed at improving them, but they may be integrated or even substituted by electric
motors and the control task may be, more or less completely, performed by the
vehicle itself. So two main topics in the future of motor vehicles are elettriﬁcation
and robotization.

The future of land mobility, particularly in urban conditions, will be autonomous

E-mobility (Fig. 28.1)?

Autonomous E-mobility is often assessed to be the ﬁnal solution to most problems
of present land transportation: safety, pollution, greenhouse gases emissions, driving

stress and even to trafﬁc congestionstion. However, the problem still to be solved
along this way are many: from technical to economical, from legislative to linked to
the public acceptance and even to philosophical problems.

28.2 Radically Smaller, Lighter, Cheaper and Greener

Vehicles

A common criticism, that has not only technical but also political implications, is
that the cars we build are too big and heavy for the needs of people using them.
A consequence of this statement is that much smaller, lighter, cheaper and conse-
quently environmentally friendly, cars can be built. These vehicles are mostly thought
for urban use, for a number of reasons:

• Cars are presently used mostly within city boundaries, and thus improving the
situation in these conditions has the largest impact on the problems we want to
solve (fuel consumption, pollution, etc.);

• the same problems are more critical in urban areas, where the size of present cars

causes congestion, and the related decrease of the average speed, worse;

• present vehicles seem to be designed with long range travel in mind, and they
appear to be unnecessarily fast, powerful, big and even unnecessarily comfortable
when used on short distances.

The radical response to this challenge is to introduce innovative vehicles, usually
referred to as Urban Personal Mobility vehicles, that are much smaller and lighter,
are designed to carry one or two persons and possibly are powered by electric motors.
Some examples, with conﬁgurations with less than 4 wheels, are shown in Figs. 20.2,
20.3 and 20.4. Other proposals can be classiﬁed in the cathegory of quadricycles ,
or microcars (Fig. 28.2).

28.2 Radically Smaller, Lighter, Cheaper and Greener Vehicles

597

Fig. 28.2 Microcars. a Nissan Pivo 2; b Bajaj Qute

Actually, Urban Personal Mobility vehicles are not as innovative as they seem:
we have already something similar, i.e. small motor bikes and mopeds, possibly in
their modern electric version, and microcars, that can also be electric. And these new
‘alternative’ vehicles have the same drawbacks as the old ones: they are much less
comfortable, in particular in case of bad weather, they carry only a small quantity of
luggage and their cost is comparable to, and in case of electric vehicles, often higher
than, that of small city cars, using this term to designate vehicles that fully qualify
as cars, although being at the smallest end of the cathegory.

However, the biggest problem of these vehicles is their low safety. In spite of
their limited speed, that often is such only theoretically, they offer only a limited
protection to the driver and possible passengers. And this is not something that can
be corrected by a better design: In a way they are dangerous by design, since they
do not comply with the safety regulations of cars. If they did, they would need to
incorporate crashworthy structures, safety devices like airbags etc. and their weight
would be higher. At this point they would need larger engines (or electric motors and
batteries, or perhaps they would need to be hybrid, with the weight and complexity
penalty that HV entail), better braking systems and so on, and their mass, power,
fuel consumption and environmental impact would be close to those of present—or
future, if we project the comparison to a future where both UPM vehicles and cars
have beneﬁtted from a few years of continuous progress—city cars. And, if they
are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) they will have the same problems of all other
electric vehicles. Owing to these factors, they will remain a niche product and will
cover the same niche that now is occupied by small motorcycles and mopeds, with
which they will compete.

Small city cars, that satisfy all regulations to be considered cars, are obviously
another matter, and it is predictable that they will become more common in the
future. However, they will be not much lighter and smaller and, if they will use less
energy (fuel or electric energy) than present city cars, of which they represent an
evolution, it will be for the general advancement of the technology, of which the
whole automotive sector will beneﬁt.

598

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

28.3 Radically Safer Cars

As we have seen, the main problem which prevents from building much smaller
vehicles than those we use today is safety. Often we feel motor cars as an unsafe means
of transportation. Some statistics about the safety of motor vehicles are reported in
Sect. 17.3.1.

As a consequence, we often claim that we need radically safer vehicles: Here we
are speaking about human lives, and even a single dead person on the road is a tragedy
that must be avoided. Also the cost of road accidents is huge and, particularly in times
of economic restrictions, a cut of these costs would be a welcome achievement. On
the other side any human activity involves some risk, and the idea of transportation
without accidents is just an utopian goal. The risks linked with any activity may
be dealt with only statistically, trying to reduce them but always remembering that
safety has a cost and that this cost must always be taken into account. If we forget it,
we can easily take counter-productive measures.

Consider for instance that in a country a law is passed imposing very high safety
standards (something like the Experimental Safety Vehicles of the 1970s, but this
time actually working ones). As a consequence the cost of cars would have a sharp
increase, and a number of people, who cannot afford these vehicles or simply want to
spend their money in another way, would shift to other means of transportation like
bicycles or motorcycles, that are much more dangerous. As a result of that law the
number of casualties on the road would have a sharp increase instead of the expected
decrease.

Another point is that the way we perceive safety is quite subjective and changes
from time to time and from country to country. From Table 17.6 it is clear the the
highest incidence of casualities per inhabitant per year occurs in Africa, but most
concerns about road safety occurs in the western and east asia countries. We think that
the problem of car accidents and casualties due to transportation is linked with our
way of moving around, based on cars, however, before cars were used, the casualties
due to accidents with horses and carts were much more than those now due to the
use of motor cars. And not surprisingly, since there was no safety rule (no rule of
any type) for carts, the road were much worse, and so on. But at that time the public
concern about safety was much less and nobody bothered about it.

The mortality, in deaths per billion passenger km, due to the use of road vehicles
and, for comparison, to air travel is reported in Fig. 28.3 (data referred to the United
States, except for those about cycling and walking that are referred to Great Britain).
In the case of cars the data are referred to billion vehicles km: Since the average
occupancy of cars is 1.6 passengers, to obtain comparable results the curve should
be divided by 1.6. Note that the curve related to motorcycles has been divided by a
factor of 10, so that it can ﬁt into the plot.

Traveling by car is thus seven times safer than cycling, eight times safer than
walking and 22 times safer than riding a motorcycle. From this plot we can draw the
conclusion that cars are the safest way to move, except from aircraft (and trains, not
included in the plot). This in a way is obvious: aircraft and trains are operated by

comparison, to air travel. In the case of cars the data are referred to billion vehicles km. Note
that the curve related to motorcycles has been divided by a factor of 10. The data refer to the United
States, except for those related to cycling and walking that are referred to Great Britain (data from
Bjørn Lomborg, The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, Cambidge, 2005)

well trained professionals, whose physical conditions are frequently checked, and
are subjected to a maintenance routine managed by ad hoc organizations. In case
of personal mobility devices the situation can be improved by having vehicles that
help the driver in his/her task and can correct some of his/her errors (active safety),
that require less maintenance, retaining their safety for a longer time and ﬁnally that
minimize the effects of a crash on the people on board and on people hit by the
vehicle (passive safety).

A further point is that the largest decrease of mortality occurred starting from the
1930s and not from the introductions of the safety regulations (from the 1970s) whose
effects do not seem to have been so large; perhaps, however, they were effective in
stopping the small increase that took place in the 1960s. The decrease of mortal-
ity seems to be more an effect of the evolution of cars, and of the infrastructures
(better design, more care to maintenance, better infrastructures, etc.) than of speciﬁc
regulations.

A ﬁnal point that can be seen in the plot is that the largest decrease of mortality
occurred in a period in which there was a large increase of the average speed of cars:
the common opinion that speed is dangerous in itself is not conﬁrmed at all and the
introduction of speed limits, that initially were not justiﬁed by safety reasons but by
the need of saving fuel during the oil crisis of the 1970s, had little effect in increasing
the trend toward safer road transportation.

The ﬁgure shows that also mortality due to other ways of travelling on roads,
walking, cycling, riding motor bikes, decreased. In part this can be ascribed to the

600

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

safety regulations for cars aimed to reduce the damages that pedestrian and cyclists
suffer when colliding with a car.

In any case the trend toward a lower accident rate continued after 1998, the year
at which the curves of Fig. 28.3 stop. This decrease must continue also for the future,
and the evolutionary trend leading to improvements in vehicle safety must go on.
Also here, however, there is no need to resort to revolutionary changes in vehicle
design, but only to the application of those provisions that now are available, or will
be available in the future, to help drivers in their task and to protect the occupants in
case of a crash. Non technical measures, like those designed to prevent people from
driving in conditions leading to dangers or to improve infrastructures, will have an
important effect.

Future diffusion of vehicular communication systems (V2x: Vehicle to both other
vehicles and infrastructure), can improve safety. This concept has been pushed to
its ultimate consequences, stating that once each car is connected to the web, and is
aware of the position of ﬁxed obstacles and other road users (vehicles, pedestrians,
bicyclists, but also animals, etc.) trafﬁc accidents would be totally eliminated. As a
consequence, passive safety precautions would no more be needed, and the Urban
Personal Mobility vehicles described in the previous section could become fully
feasible.2 While it is clear that communication systems could decrease the number
of accidents, it is questionable whether we could rely only on them to protect people
travelling by car and other road users, and the possibility of reducing drastically the
mass, and consequently the power, fuel consumption and environmental impact of
cars in this way is questionable.

The increase of safety due to advanced driving assistance systems and then to
autonomous vehicles may lead to the possibility of increasing the average speed on
motorways, by raising the speed limitation now enforced in the majority of countries.

28.4 Modular Vehicles

One of the most interesting outcomes of E-mobility is the possibility of locating
electric motors in the wheels (see the chapter dedicated to powertrains). It is possible
to go further in this direction, by concentrating all the functions regarding each wheel,
namely power, suspension, braking and steering, in a single unit, usually deﬁned a
corner . Each corner can thus be assembled on the car using a mechanical, power
and control interface.

An example of this approach is the Active Wheel built by Michelin, shown in
Fig. 28.4. In the ﬁgure it is easy to see the active suspension, with its spring and
electric actuator, the traction motor, the steering system with its actuator, the disc
brake and the mechanical interface, consisting in a ﬂange used to bolt the unit to the
vehicle frame. The active wheel needs also a power interface, to supply power to
the traction and steering motors but also to the active suspension unit, a command

bridge, 2010.

28.4 Modular Vehicles

601

Fig. 28.4 The active wheel built by Michelin: a complete corner unit, provided with drive motor,
brake, suspension and steering

interface, that carries all the x-by-wire controls for the motor and the steering and
brake actuators, and a sensor interface to send back the outputs of all the sensors the
wheel is provided with to the electronic control unit of the vehicle. The sensors must
include a velocity sensor, accelerometers, pressure sensors for the tire, a steering
angle sensor, force sensors and many other sensing units that allow us to keep the
operation of the corner under close control.

In this case the drive motor is provided by a ﬁxed ratio speed reducer, and this
allows us to keep the unsprung mass to a low value to improve both comfort and
handling.

Four active corners of this type (but also three, in case of a 3-wheeled tilting
vehicle or six for a larger van) can be directly mounted on a frame, that can be a
more or less classical unibody or may be just a chassis like in the electric skateboard
concept: a unit of this kind, built by GM is shown in Fig. 28.5. In the latter case, the
chassis contains the power pack, made of batteries or fuel cells, and in turn carries a
body that has little or no structural functions.

The modularity is thus pushed to its limits, returning to the approach that was
common at the beginning of the automotive evolution, when the frame and the body
were separate units. New materials, design methods and power plants might make
this concept competitive again with the more traditional one. The ultimate goal is that
the units can be designed and built separately, being possible to assemble them with
a ’plug-and-play philosophy like at present is done with computers. The customer
could thus buy a frame, four active corners (all with driving motors or just two
motorized and two free wheeling), a body plus all the accessories needed to obtain
a fully customized vehicle. This approach will easily be technically feasible, but it
is still to be demonstrated that it is also economically feasible, above all if the scale
of production and the safety requirements are also taken into account.

four active corners

28.5 Reduction of the Fuel Consumption

The efforts which are at present made to improve the performance of the power
plant have been described in Chapter 22. Another approach for reducing the fuel
consumption of a vehicle, thus reducing also its environmental impact, is to reduce
the so-called road load, i.e. the total resistance to motion. Any improvement in
this area is not only effective in reducing fuel consumption, but also in decreasing
emissions, since the amount of pollutant and greenhouse gas emitted is proportional,
everything else remaining equal, to the amount of fuel burned, or more in general,
to the amount of energy spent.

This applies in general to conventional vehicles, but there are cases where this
effect is particularly important: in case of battery electric vehicles, for instance, the
reduction of the road load leads to an increase of range, which is the most critical issue
for BEV or, if the range is kept constant, in a reduction of the mass of the batteries. The
mass of the electric motors and, consequently, the total mass of strategic materials
needed for building batteries and electric motors, are reduced too.

In most of the innovative vehicles which will be seen in details in the following
sections, the total amount of energy carried on board is quite critical, and so anything
that can reduce the total road load increases their feasibility.

28.5 Reduction of the Fuel Consumption

603

28.5.1 Aerodynamic Drag

Much has been done in recent years to reduce aerodynamic drag of vehicles, in par-
ticular as a result of the energy crisis of the 1970s. Unfortunately, further improve-
ments are at the same time more difﬁcult and less effective: more difﬁcult because it
is difﬁcult to further improve the already streamlined shape of present cars, and less
effective because, while aerodynamic drag was a substantial fraction of the total road
load when the average Cx of cars was 0.45–0.5, now that it approaches 0.25–0.3 it
is much less important.

Moreover, aerodynamic drag is important only at constant high speed, in practice
in motorway driving, and the mileage driven by vehicles in these condition is a small
fraction of the total, in many cases averaging something like 7% or 8%. In the most
frequent driving conditions, namely urban and suburban driving, the importance of
aerodynamic drag goes from nil to marginal. This is even more so because of the
speed limits imposed by the law in most countries: in North America, for instance,
where motorway driving is more important than in Europe, the low speed limits make
aerodynamic drag of little consequence. Germany is the only European country in
which there are motorways with no speed limitations, and in these driving conditions
the reduction of aerodynamic drag can be an interesting energy conservation practice.
This does not mean that a good aerodynamic design will not be important in
the future: car aerodynamics does not deal only with drag reduction. Aerodynamic
design deals with comfort (mostly noise reduction), safety (improving handling and
stability) and other issues, like avoiding the deposition of dirt on head lamps and
windows. The point is that in most cases these requirements are conﬂicting, and
what is done to improve handling may for instance cause an increase of drag or an
improvement in noise may cause a decrease of handling characteristics. It is well
known that aerodynamic negative lift, essential to improve the performance of sports
and racing cars by increasing the forces the tires can transfer to the ground, causes
a strong increase of drag.

Aerodynamics is also strictly related with style, and with the habitability of a
vehicle. As a general conclusion, we can expect that in the future motor vehicles will
be carefully studied from the aerodynamic viewpoint but, nevertheless, the reduction
of aerodynamic drag will contribute only marginally to the reduction of fuel—or
energy—consumption.

28.5.2 Rolling Resistance

The reduction of rolling resistance is on the contrary one of the most important ways
to achieve a reduction of fuel consumption. Rolling resistance is the most impor-
tant form of resistance to motion at low speed, and thus its reduction is important
in urban driving, the condition in which cars are mostly used. It has two aspects:

604

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

Fig. 28.6 Evolution in time of the rolling coefﬁcient (the ratio between the rolling resistance and
the load on the tire). The value of the best research tire has been reported: the values of production
tires followed in about 10 years

reduction of the weight of the vehicle (see next section) and improvement of the
rolling characteristics of the tires.

The ﬁrst substantial improvement in this sense took place in the 1960s with the
introduction of radial tires, whose rolling resistance is about 20% lower than that of
cross ply tires. In Europe radial tires became eventually compulsory, mostly for this
reason (Fig. 28.6).

Rolling resistance is mainly due to energy dissipation in the tire, and thus can be
lowered by decreasing the damping of the tire material; in the usual formulation of
elastomers used in tires, natural rubber has a lower damping than synthetic rubber
and damping increases with increasing amount of carbon black in the compound.
But while lowering damping lowers the rolling resistance at low speed, it makes the
tire more prone to vibrate, and vibration causes a sharp increase of energy dissipation
at high speed. At a certain speed (the critical speed) this increase causes overheating
of the tire and this must be avoided: it is thus impossible to decrease too much the
damping of the rubber material, at least in tires meant to be used on fast vehicles.

In the 1970s low speed, low resistance tires were built for electric vehicles, with the
goal of increasing their range. At the end of the 1990s a new approach was introduced:
by substituting silica for carbon black it was possible to introduce a dependence of
damping on the frequency, yielding tires with superior performances, accompanied
by a lower rolling resistance. These tires were ﬁrst introduced by Michelin and
dubbed as green tires , with a play on words: they were green in the sense they
used less energy, so lowering their environmental impact, but owing to the lack of
carbon black they could be built in any color and, in the initial intention of their
manufacturer, they would have also been green in color. Market studies showed that
customers would not like tires of colors making them look like toys, and so they
were colored in black, and the term ‘green’ applied only in a ﬁgurative sense. Notice
that the term ‘green tire’ is also used in a wider sense, for any tire allegedly more

28.5 Reduction of the Fuel Consumption

605

environmentally friendly than traditional ones, and these claims are sometimes little
substantiated.

The tendency toward a reduction of rolling resistance will continue in the future,
with the obvious caveat that a tire is a complex object and that any change in its
structure, material, production technology, etc. will affect its performance as a whole,
from the ability to produce forces to safety considerations, from rolling resistance
to cost and duration. A tire must be a compromise among all these features, and it
makes no sense to try to optimize a single feature neglecting the other ones. It seems
that at least a partial substitution of silica for carbon black is effective and that future
cars will have a lower rolling resistance than present ones.

28.5.3 Vehicle Mass

Reduction of the mass of a vehicle has a twofold positive effect on the reduction
of fuel consumption: on one side it reduces rolling resistance, and on the other it
reduces the energy needed to accelerate, together with the energy to be dissipated
in the brakes. The energy needed to accelerate can be reduced also by reducing the
moment of inertia of the rotating parts, at equal mass. These effects are all particularly
important in urban driving, and so reducing the vehicle mass plays an important role
in the conditions that are statistically the most frequent.

In spite of these considerations the mass of cars has increased in the recent past
and it is difﬁcult to predict a decrease in the near future. This is a result of several
mechanisms, partly linked with customer’s requirements (customers are increasingly
interested in comfort and less in performace, preferring large saloon cars or SUVs to
smaller sportcars) and partly with the regulations, mostly regarding safety, imposed
on the car industry.

From experience in the aeronautic industry, it is well known that weight reduction
is not a matter of cutting much weight in a few selected spots of the vehicle, a thing
that is usually impossible, but to shave a few grams in a large number of places. In
a similar way, an increase of weight is not usually the result of adding a few large
masses, a thing that is easily controlled, but of adding in many places masses that,
each one considered in itself, seem to be negligible.

Modern cars must pass a number of safety tests that require not only an accurate
structural design, but also the introduction of safety related elements. Safety has costs,
and the increase of the vehicle mass is one of them. Structurally, the requirements
of absorbing crash energy and at the same time of providing a rigid survival cell,
providing rigid attachment points for safety belts, introducing elements like air bags,
with all the related electronics and deployment systems, anti-intrusion beams and
plates, ﬁreproof elements, etc. cause an increase of the vehicle mass.

Three wheeled vehicles, that in most countries are not required to comply with
the safety regulations that apply to cars but to the more relaxed rules that apply to
motorcycles, can be much lighter. The same is true for those microcars or quadricycles
that, owing to their mass and power lower than given limits stated by the law, are not

606

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

required to comply with the automotive safety rules. No doubt they are much lighter,
but they are also much less safe, by design.

Active safety has a lower impact on the vehicle mass, but all the devices like ABS,
antispin, VDC, EPS and so on have their electronic control unit, actuators and other
devices that add to the mass of the vehicle. Large windows to improve visibility are
another weight increase factor.

The ever-increasing search for comfort implies the introduction of phono-
absorbent materials, vibration insulators, vibration absorbers and improved inter-
nal ﬁnishing materials. Even electronic devices, sometimes with an utilitarian scope,
others just entertainment gadgets, have their mass.

Many customers like large cars, and in many countries, particularly in Europe,
the average size of cars has not decreased in the past years. In North America, after
a decrease in the 1970s, as a consequence of the energy crisis, the size of cars started
to increase again mostly due to the success of SUVs and the continuing popularity
of pick-ups. This trend is not likely to be reversed, except for unexpected events
like a generalized increase of the cost of energy or the introduction of regulations
penalizing large cars.

From what has been said, it is predictable that the trend toward larger vehicle
masses is going to continue. The only factors that may ﬁght against it are the
improved stress analysis techniques, that can contain the structural mass through
a more optimized design, and the introduction of new materials. These two factors,
and in particular the ﬁrst one, are not new, and in the past allowed a reduction of
the increase of the mass of vehicles below what could have been if the traditional
approach was used.

28.6 Possibilities of Breakthrough

From the previous sections a conclusion can be drawn: it is unlikely that the car of
the future will be radically different from that of today, due to revolutionary changes,
while it is likely that it will accumulate a large number of small improvements that
can be seen as a continuation of the evolution that has occurred in the past. The
accumulation of these improvements will eventually lead to vehicles that will be
much better than the present ones in a scenario of continuity.

However, we cannot exclude that sooner or later this evolution will lead to a
radically new vehicle that could be considered as a motor car only because it will
fulﬁl the task that now cars are performing in our society. The point is the usual
one: In the past several times prototypes of vehicles intended to perform the same
tasks of cars in different ways were built, some of them performed in a more or less
successful way, but they were never produced in signiﬁcant quantities and they never
substituted for conventional motor vehicles.

28.6.1 Flying Cars

The enthusiasm for light aviation that was so widespread in the 1950s and 1960s, in
particular in the United States, lead to the idea that it was possible to build vehicles
that could travel on normal roads and, when required, ﬂy like aircraft. They were
usually called ﬂying cars, but the term roadable aircraft was also used. As usual with
hybrid concepts it is possible to conceive a variety of solutions from a true car that
could (sometimes) ﬂy to a true aircraft that could taxi and take off from roads open
to the public.

Since the beginning it was clear that the two concepts of car and aircraft are in
a way alternative and that it was difﬁcult to strike a compromise. A car must cover
a small area to share the road with other vehicles, and in particular cannot be wider
than a given size, imposed by the width of a road lane, that is in turn established by
laws. An aircraft needs a lifting surface to collect aerodynamic forces, a surface that
cannot be too small owing to the low differential pressure air can exert on it and the
width of this surface, the wingspan, is critical. Moreover, the smaller is this area, the
higher is the take-off speed and the higher the power needed to ﬂy, not to mention
the difﬁculties to control the aircraft. Owing to these contradictory requirements, in
some attempts, mostly the earliest (the ﬁrst prototype that actually ﬂew was built
by Waldo Waterman in 1937), the vehicle had two conﬁgurations and had to be
manually reconﬁgured to pass from one to the other. More modern prototypes are
able to reconﬁgure themselves using a number of actuators that unfold the wings or
the rotor blades. A recent prototype of the last type is the ﬂying car presented by
Terrefugia at the 2012 New York Auto Show, named The Transition® (Fig. 28.7).
More than a ﬂying car, it is a roadable aircraft.

One of the points with ﬂying cars is not technical: owing to the very nature of
this type of vehicle, at present there is no speciﬁc standard for ﬂying cars. They are
motor vehicles but also aircraft so there is no speciﬁc certiﬁcation they must obtain
to be used on roads open to the public and to ﬂy in an open airspace. By their own
nature, they will ﬂy, at least in the take-off and landing phases, at altitudes at which

Fig. 28.7 The Transition®, a roadable aircraft presented by Terrefugia at the 2012 New York Auto
Show

608

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

ﬂying is forbidden, particularly in urban areas, and must land where regular aircraft
cannot land.

Moreover, many projects at present underway deal with multicopters, a conﬁgu-
ration which by now is used only for drones (UAV). A speciﬁc regulation for human
carrying multicopters is still missing. And in general it is likely that ﬂying cars,
particularly if powered by electric batteries, are too heavy to enter the ultralight
cathegory.

Before ﬂying cars can be used in spaces (on the ground and above it) open to
other vehicles, a new speciﬁc cathegory of vehicles must be introduced, and speciﬁc
standards must be issued.

Both ﬁxed wings and rotary wings prototypes were built, the latter both in the
form of helicopters and autogyros. After a period of stagnation, a new golden age
of these attempts started about year 2000, and the new prototypes could take advan-
tage of the advancements in automatic control systems to make ﬂight control easier
and safer. Both NASA and DARPA took interest in developing the concept. In 2007
NASA funded a two-million dollars contest to build ﬂying cars, dubbed for the occa-
sion Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) and DARPA started a 65-million dollars program
to develop a four-places roadable aircraft by 2015, able to take off vertically and
having a 450 km range. Also the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) promoted
conventions on the subject of ﬂying cars in various cities.

The ﬁxed wing solution is more typical of roadable aircraft than of ﬂying cars.
The take-off and landing speed is fairly high, particularly if the wing load is high, as
it could easily happen in the case of ﬂying car in which it is difﬁcult to have a large
enough wing.

The aerodynamic lift on a wing has already been studied when dealing with the
devices to produce downward forces to increase the forces at the road-wheel contact.
The expression of the lift force is here repeated:

where CL is the lift coefﬁcient which depends, like the already seen drag coefﬁcient,
on the Reynolds and the Mach numbers.

The lift and drag coefﬁcients of a wing are plotted as functions of the angle of

attack α in Fig. 28.8a. On the same plot also the efﬁciency of the wing

is reported. The curves are for a given wing, but are typical.

The curves CL (α) and C D (α) are inﬂuenced by many characteristics of the wing,
like the airfoil and the planform. In particular, the drop of the lift after its maximum
value has been reached (a phenomenon called stall of the wing), can be more or less
abrupt.

b polar diagram of an airplane

It is possible to increase the lift coefﬁcient, although at the expense of an increase
of the drag coefﬁcient, by using suitable moving surfaces located at the trailing edge
(ﬂaps) or at the leading edge (slats), which change the airfoil characteristics. These
high lift devices, used in all modern aircraft for take-off and landing, may be even
more important in case of ﬂying cars because of the need of reducing the take-off
and landing speed.

The dependence of the aerodynamic characteristics of a body from the angle of
attack can be summarized in the polar diagram: a plot of the lift coefﬁcient as a
function of the drag coefﬁcient. The polar diagram for an airplane is reported in
Fig. 28.8b.

The speed at which a ﬁxed wing aircraft must ﬂy to sustain itself can be easily

computed by equating the weight with the aerodynamic lift

This yields the ﬂying speed

The minimum take-off speed can thus be computed by introducing the maximum
value of the lift coefﬁcient into Eq. (28.4). At higher speeds the airplane ﬂies with a
lower lift coefﬁcient.

The drag at the ﬂight speed is

i.e. is equal to weight divided by the aerodynamic efﬁciency.

The reciprocal of the efﬁciency is thus a sort of a friction coefﬁcient, i.e. a number

that multiplied by the weight gives the force that opposes to motion.

The attitude of the aircraft that minimizes the drag is that characterized by the

maximum aerodynamic efﬁciency.

The power required for ﬂight is the product of the drag by the speed

To reduce the take-off speed and the power required, it is possible to increase the

wing area.

The attitude (i.e. the angle of attack) of the aircraft that minimizes the power

required for motion is that at which the product

is maximum. Such attitude is also that allowing the maximum ﬂight duration for a
given quantity of energy stored on board.

The attitude maximizing the ﬂight time is the same as the one that minimizes the

power required for ﬂight.

It is easy to understand that a ﬁxed wing ﬂying car is unpractical and requies great
skill, particularly for taking off and landing, which are practically impossible from
urban roads. A ﬂying car may have two types of application: long range journeys, to
exploit the higher speed of air travel, and for urban use, to avoid trafﬁc. In the ﬁrst
case ﬁxed wings ﬂying cars may be used, while in the second the possibility of taking
off and lnding vertically (Vertical Take-Off and Landing, VTOL) of helicopters is
essential. A helicopter ﬂying car has the added advantage of landing on the roof of
buildings.

A helicopter ﬂying car can thus be used as a urban taxi or, speaking of autonomous

vehicles, as Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) vehicle.

However helicopters have the disadvantage of having a large rotor, with no outer
shroud at the blade tips, and being quite difﬁcult to control. The control is performed
through cyclic pitch, to incline the rotor plane about the x-axis and the y-axis, col-
lective pitch to control the vertical motion and the tail rotor to control rotations about
the z-axis.

These reasons made multirotors, provided with a number of ﬁxed pitch propellers,

a much better solution, particularly for city ﬂying cars.

One of the most interesting concepts is the quadcopter/convertiplane Skycar M400

built by Moller International (Fig. 28.9).

28.6 Possibilities of Breakthrough

611

Fig. 28.9 The Skycar built by Moller International

The interesting point of this concept is that it does not need to be re-conﬁgured for
ﬂying and that, owing to its strongly automated control and GPS-based navigation
systems, can be ﬂown safely by anyone, or at least this is the claim of its builder.
On the other side it seems that the designers were more concerned with the behavior
of the vehicle as a ﬂying machine than as a car: the wheels are apparently more the
undercarriage of a helicopter than the running gear of a road vehicle, but this can be
improved later.

A conﬁguration for unmanned rotorcraft that is now quite popular is the so-called
quadrotor or quadrocopter, generally consisting in a cruciform structure with a
rotor at the end of each one of the four arms. Quadcopter UAVs (Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles) or drones have usually ﬁxed pitch rotors, that in the smallest models usually
reduce to four propellers rotating about vertical axes. Their control is much simpler
than that of single or twin rotors helicopters, which must have a variable pitch with
both collective and cyclic pitch control. A picture of a miniature quadcopter is shown
in Fig. 28.10a (the size of the machine is just a few centimeters across), while a larger
machine (the Parrot AR. Drone) is shown in Fig. 28.10b.

The control of a quadcopter is achieved by varying the speed, and then the thrust,
of each rotor, a thing which is easy if electric motors are used. With reference to
Fig. 28.10a, rotors 1 and 4 rotate in one direction while rotors 2 and 3 rotate in
the opposite direction, so that the reaction torques are balanced and no tail rotor is
needed, as in single rotor helicopters. By

612

• Reducing the speed of rotors 1 and 3, and increasing that of rotors 2 and 4, a roll
rotation (rotation about x axis) to the left is obtained, while the torques are still
balanced.

• Reducing the speed of rotors 1 and 2, and increasing that of rotors 3 and 4,
a pitch rotation (rotation about y axis) to dive is obtained, while the torques are
still balanced.

• Reducing the speed of rotors 1 and 4, and increasing that of rotors 2 and 3,
a yaw rotation (rotation about z axis) is obtained. The direction of the yaw rotation
depends on the direction of the rotation of the rotors.

By using a simple control electronics and sensors (generally rate gyros) a quad-
copter can be easily controlled, achieving a good maneuverability, being able to ﬂy
in any direction and turn on the spot. They are scalable from miniature to large
machines.

From the experience gained with millions of quadcopter drones already sold and
scaling them up, it is possible to build electric ﬂying cars based on this conﬁguration,
although some problems with batteries still remain. A hybrid conﬁguration with
the ICE—or perhaps a gas turbine—used as a range extender is however possible.
Recently Italdesign and Airbus presented the pop-up project based on the quadcopter
conﬁguration (Fig. 28.11): a modular vehicle based on a capsule carrying 2 people,
which can be attached either to a four-wheels skateboard or to a quadcopter. The
vehicle has been designed to be an autonomous vehicle in both conﬁgurations.

A propeller rotating at an angular velocity (cid:4) produces a thrust which can be

approximated by the formula:

F = 2kρ S(cid:4)2 ,

(28.7)

where k is a constant which in hovering depends only on the geometry of the propeller
and S is the area of the propeller disc. If a multicopter (Fig. 28.10) with n rotors has
a mass m, the equilibrium equation at take-off is

mg = 2nkρ S(cid:4)2 .

Consider for instance a quadcopter with a mass of 800 kg provided with propellers
having a diameter of 1.5 m and operating at sea level (ρ = 1.225 kg/m3) in standard
conditions. The power required for taking off and hovering is 167 kW, i.e., 41.8 kW
on each motor even if larger power is needed to insure the required ﬂight performace.
Instead of quadcopters, hexacopters (with 6 propellers) may be used with the
advantage of redundancy. In case of the failure of one of the motors, the others can
still ensure ﬂying with reduced performance and above all a safe landing. On the
other side, simpler conﬁgurations with just 3 rotors can be built, although the control
simplicity of multicopters with 4 or more rotors is lost. Vehicles with just two rotors,
often called hovering bykes, have also been tested: they require either cyclic pitch,
like twin rotors helicopters, or a control similar to that of motor bykes, in which
the driver moves his/her body to maintain equilibrium even if an automatic control
system may perform the same task.

Multicopters are usually provided with electric propulsion, because the drivers
of the electric motors can perform the control functions varying the speed of the
various propellers in a straightforward way. While machines similar to multicopters
have been built using gas turbines to power the propellers, (in the case of Fig. 28.9
the nacelles with the turbines and the propellers are orientable, like in the case of
convertiplanes, so that the control is different from that of a typical quadcopter) the
idea of fully electric multicopter ﬂying cars is the most common. In this case the
weight of the batteries may easily be the limiting factor, and these devices may have

614

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

Fig. 28.12 The Aero-X hoverbike: a twinrotor vehicle, which is half way between a multirotor and
a hovrcraft

to wait until batteries with a high enough speciﬁc energy and speciﬁc power have
been developed.

A possibility is a ﬂying car powered by a gas turbine (or two for redundancy)
driving an alternator powering the electric motors through a number of inverters
which perform the control tasks. Instead of two turbines, just one can be used, with
safety being assured by a small number of batteries, which guarantee a safe landing
in case of power generator wailure. The vehicle can thus evolve toward an hybrid
conﬁguration, with the possibility of being a BEV when on city roads, and ﬂying as
a turbine powered multicopter when in the sky. While a quadcopter needs that all
rotors are working to maintain controllability, an exacopter can continue working
even with one rotor out of service: a sort of redundancy which improves safety.
A much simpler solution is a twinrotor vehicle like the hoverbike shown in Fig. 28.12.
A twin rotor is not controllable around the roll axis using its rotors, but requires
either a displacement of the rider position (like bikes) or a cyclic pitch control like
in helicopters. The hovebike is however more an hovercraft than a multirotor and
likely it cannot travel at large distances from the ground.

The problems with ﬂying cars are however not only technical, even if just to have
them ﬂying successfully and safely is a great achievement: the bigger concerns are
how to control the ﬂight of many of these ﬂying vehicles in a small, possibly urban,
area. In fact this was the point raised by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)
when Henry Ford proposed to mass produce ﬂying cars before World War 2, and this
is still the point today, in spite of the improvements of the air trafﬁc control systems.
Perhaps the only way is to have automatic route planning and collision avoidance
devices based on networking of the computers installed in each car and working
through V2x (Vehicle to both other vehicles and infrastructure) communications, but
this is a difﬁcult task, much harder than the similar systems proposed for dealing
with trafﬁc control on motorways and not yet implemented.

Issues about energy consumption and environmental sustainability of air cars will
also be raised. As a conclusion, it is likely that ﬂying cars will be built in the future
and a niche market will develop—for instance, an air taxis market, like that predicted

28.6 Possibilities of Breakthrough

615

by Uber—, but it seems unlikely they will become a popular transportation means,
with a diffusion comparable with that of present motor cars.

28.6.2 Other Advanced Vehicles

Starting from the late 1950s, particularly in the United Kingdom, a new kind of
vehicle was developed and raised great hopes: the hovercraft. This device was based
on an air cushion created by vertical axis fans, and could travel on land and water,
not needing a prepared surface, although the power required for hovering grows fast
with increasing ground irregularities. On very smooth ground the power required
for motion is comparable with that of wheeled vehicles. In spite of the predictions
about hovering cars, the development of hovercraft was toward large commercial or
military crafts, and even those started declining. Small personal hovercraft are now
limited to amateur usage and there are several clubs of people who build their own
vehicles often from drawings or kits. Hovercraft are much more suited to moving
over water than over solid ground and, in the latter application, there is no reason
for which they should be considered better than conventional wheeled vehicles: they
use more power, are more noisy, more complicated and much more difﬁcult to drive
since driving, braking and cornering forces are not supplied by the contact between
the vehicle and the ground, but by aerodynamic forces. It is easily predictable that
there are no hovering cars in the future of ground transportation.

Magnetic levitation vehicles have been extensively experimented and there are
commercial short lines served by magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains. All these vehi-
cles are however guided vehicles and are comparable with trains and not with cars.
After many contrasting decisions, at present it seems that Maglev trains will not be
a widespread option for the near future.

Even dimmer is the perspective of building magnetic levitation cars. In the enthu-
siasm raised by the discovery of high temperature superconductors in 1986 many
predictions about the possibility of levitating objects as big as vehicles were for-
warded. These ideas were based on the prediction that higher and higher tempera-
ture (possibly up to room temperature) superconductors could become possible and
that their performance could be improved. These predictions didn’t materialize, and
non-guided magnetic levitation vehicles remained just dreams, but patents have been
ﬁled and designs have been forwarded. Moreover, like in the case of hovercraft, the
problem of generating driving and cornering forces without a contact with the ground
remain.

Another more realistic idea has also been forwarded: a wheeled vehicle whose
wheels are supported by magnetic bearings instead of rolling element bearings, or
in a more fantastic way, vehicles whose tires are suspended to the wheels through
magnetic bearings. To suspend the wheels on magnetic bearings is fully possible
(less to suspend the tires, a thing that anyway has no advantage) but the advantage in
doing so is not clear. With respect to a conventional wheeled vehicle the only energy
saving is due to the reduced bearing drag, that is at any rate much less than the

616

28 Perspectives of Future Evolution

rolling resistance of the tires. In trains the advantage of magnetic levitation is linked
with the possibilities of reaching speeds well above the maximum speed allowed by
the wheels, and even in this case the progress of conventional railways that allowed
reaching higher and higher speeds makes questionable the actual large scale use of
maglev trains. In cars the possibility of actually travelling that fast is ruled out, so
that there is little space for dreams of maglev cars.

As a conclusion, short of radical advances leading to ‘science ﬁction’ technologies
allowing levitation of a vehicle over a road surface, it seems that we can safely exclude
this possibility in a foreseeable future.

The only possibility for radically new types of vehicles that remains is linked to
discovering new physical principles, like antigravity vehicles. Although the possi-
bility of controlling gravity is accepted as a theoretical possibility by a number of
scientists and a number of experiments have been conducted by respectable scien-
tiﬁc institutions, sometimes even with the sponsorship of space agencies like NASA,
there is no proof that it is actually possible, and no serious hint about how to do it.
But is it worth while anyway? In particular, the advantage would be only to avoid
rolling resistance, that is responsible for a not too large part of the energy required
for motion while all other problems would remain there, and some, like producing
tractive, braking and cornering forces, would become much worse.
